And twisting me around

And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within

Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away

12044,Coffee and TV,Blur,"[Verse 1]
Do you feel like a chainstore?
Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around, bored
Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are

[Chorus]
So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big, bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

[Verse 2]
Do you go to the country?
It isn't very far
There's people there who will hurt you
Because of who you are
Your ears are full of the language
There's wisdom there, you're sure
Until the words start slurring
And you can't find the door

[Chorus]
So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually

12003,Angels,Robbie Williams,"[Verse 1]
I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate?
And do they know the places where we go
When we're grey and old?
'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Verse 2]
When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one-way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Verse 1: $LICK $LOTH]
I'm sinking to unknown levels, the devil with no brake pedal
Stop all this murder, mo' murder, drugs got me cockin' the burner
Run up in your house, duct tape on your mouth
Evil shit, hittin' licks, never a drought
$uicide Grey*59, future is now
Lucifer in the flesh, you'd hear the sound
$ui, $ui-cide, $uicide!
Poppin' these pills, and I'm poppin' these shells
Oxy and heron crushed up in a bill
Feel like I'm watched by the eyes in the hill
$carecrow the menace, but $carecrow don't panic
I called on JGRXXN, and they ready to kill
Lil Uzi cocked, and he ready to drill
Smokin' out, locin' out in a DeVille

[Verse 2: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Roaches swarm around me as I rise and levitate
I be the snake of Genesis leading the Exodus to an unknown place
And claim it's safe, uh!
Gathering sheep to the slaughter, I show 'em the blade
Let them pray to the father and sneak up behind them
And open their veins, the devil in wolf's clothing
Yung Plague attends them demon masquerades
But I ain't mask my face
I pass the blade and ask to trade their soul for cash and fame
I scratch these names off of my list
I trash the place and dip back to my pit of ash and bones and hibernate
My sack of souls ain't gon' escape

Watch me hypnotize you niggas 'cause JGRXXN got that phonk
I'm ridin' in a steamer with some bodies in the trunk
Jug mane, jug mane, you not the jug, mane
False flaggin' niggas, come and catch a blast, mane

We runnin' down yo lane, I don't pull up I always dunk
I never gave a fuck about these niggas wanna play
And if you with the shit, please believe we on the way

Hustle the maniac
Quick attack, you can't relax, you can't relax
So on your back, you even know I'd bust your ass
Be like fuck the cash but need the cash
Hustle passion for the love of bands
I kill a man; I rob a man, I be fiendin' bad
But damn if I tell you that
You be lurkin' in my business fast
Like ‚ÄúThe fuck boy, how you doin' that?‚Äù
Before you know it I be at your neck
Like the dead, he vanish to a mist (Hustle!)
He see the noose that come up out the group
In the trunk we let bodies sit
Suicide the way we slittin' wrists
Roll the blunt then put it to my lips
Torch a car just for the love of chips
It's Hustle!

G-G-G*59 talking to the devil plot another 'nother crime
Elevate above the clouds, looking for the sun
When I fell from the heavens was losin' my mind
Rip off my wings, and I take off my halo
I'm looking for god but didn't find shit
So I slept with the devil, I sold my soul quick
I was fucking and then-then I made it my bitch
Murder suicidal, grippin' the rifle, hand on the Bible
Believe in false idols you living in dreams, but I'm stuck in reality thinking of schemes
Loss in the darkness where I become heartless
I creep through the night, and I keep my blade sharp
And I'm stuck in my wave
'Cause I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm throwing my elbows, I'm gettin' too buck

I don't wanna die

Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort

[Verse 1]
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort ‚Äì suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

[Verse 2]
I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself, and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind

Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

[Chorus 1]
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young

And see the place where you used to live

12000,In the End,Linkin Park,"[Intro: Chester Bennington]
It starts with one

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

You don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung

You've changed the locks three times

I'll never be as great as
I want to be
Everyone that I run into
The ones you always seem so into

They all seem to know exactly
What it is they want, they pass me
They smile as they go
So I work at staying patient
Good things come to those that wait
Or so they say

About, oh oh
About, about, oh oh oh
About, about, oh oh oh
About, about

Ideas die on the vine and
I feel like a fake
I lie awake believing
That somehow I keep failing
I rail and I ache
At the monsters and the demons
I've wrestled with for eons
And I want to destroy

I'm so empty
You're all I talk about
Oh oh out

And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
He called Alice
When she was just small

[Verse 3]
When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the White Knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's off with her head
Remember what the Dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your head

Open up your skull, I'll be there

Fifteen blows to your mind

Who's got the loneliest feeling

That pillaging would bring them from that freight

On the Coral Sea, in the wake of that
Machine, those creatures who have no need
Of reason, those Papuans wait to see
The wreck of an Airbus and of a Comet

And because their totem hasn't ever been able to bring down
Either a Boeing or even a Fokker to the ground
They dream of hijacks and of collisions with gulls

Those naive ship-wreckers armed now
With blowguns who make sacrifice to the cargo cult
As towards the sky and the airplanes their poison darts are bound

Where are you Melody and your lost frame
Is it haunting the archipelago where the sirens are becalmed?
Or is it clinging to the plane whose alarm
Siren has gone silent, did you remain?

Floating on the currents, have you already found
Those luminous corals of the Guinean coasts and sailed
Where those indigenous sorcerers still hope in vain
For planes to be brought to the ground?

Having nothing to lose nor a God to believe in
And so that they might return my trivial passions
I, like them, I call to the night cargo planes

And I hold onto that hope of an aviation disaster
That would bring Melody back again
A child taken captive by the lure of the stars there

What was your name?
Melody
Melody what?
Melody Nelson

When they made him, they broke the mold
If he heads this way, when the moon is slow
Come over and pray, they'll turn the buffalo
They'll turn the buffalo

There's a need to sleep in the shag of his stomach
Slide around his eye with your love in tow
If he heads this way, don't you say hello
Get out of the way, they'll turn the buffalo

Our town, our town, do love a stampede
Stampede by my old jacket in the park

Into the road of sadness
I'm walking without you

I'm falling in sorrow
Dead to the world you left me
In footsteps I follow

12076,My Death,Scott Walker,"My death is like
A swinging door
A patient girl who knows the score
Whistle for her
And the passing time

My death waits like
A bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
Weep loud for that
And the passing time

My death waits like
A witch at night
And surely as our love is bright
Let's laugh for us
And the passing time

But whatever is behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I don't care
For in front of that door
There is you

My death waits like
A beggar blind
Who sees the world with an unlit mind
Throw him a dime
For the passing time

My death waits
To allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
Let's drink to that
And the passing time

My death waits in
Your arms, your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not talk about
The passing time

But whatever is behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I don't care
For in front of that door
There is you

My death waits
Among the falling leaves
In magicians, mysterious sleeves
Rabbits, dogs
And the passing time

My death waits
Among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow cowers
Let's pick lilacs
For the passing time

My death waits in
A double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
Pull up the sheets
Against the passing time

But whatever is behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I don't care
For in front of that door
There is you

12085,Chocolate Jesus,Tom Waits,"Well, I don't go to church on Sunday
Don't get on my knees to pray
Don't memorize the books of the Bible
I got my own special way

I know Jesus loves me
Maybe just a little bit more
I fall on down on my knees every Sunday
At Zerelda Lee's candy store

Well, it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Makes me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied

Well, I don't want no Abba Zabba
Don't want no Almond Joy
There ain't nothing better
Suitable for this boy

Well, it's the only thing that can pick me up
Better than a cup of gold
See only a chocolate Jesus
Can satisfy my soul

When the weather gets rough and it's whiskey in the shade
It's best to wrap your savior up in cellophane
He flows like the big muddy, but that's okay
Pour him over ice cream for a nice parfait

Well, it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Good enough for me
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
It's good enough for me

Well, it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel so good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied

12067,Red Right Hand,Arctic Monkeys,"[Verse 1]
Take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires and the humming wires
Well, you know you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks

[Chorus]
On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

[Verse 2]
He'll wrap you in his arms and tell ya that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all of those dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
And there won't be a single thing that you can do
He's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru

[Chorus]
They're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand

[Verse 3]
You don't have no money? He'll get you some
If you haven't got no car, he'll get you one
You've got no self-respect, you feel like an insect
Well, don't you worry, buddy, 'cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrows
And the Bowery and the slums

[Chorus]
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
You'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems
You'll see him in your head and on the TV screen
Hey, buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru

[Chorus]
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by his red right hand

What is this horror, mama, flooding over me
They return, the Nazis, every 70 years
Bombs explode in Paris, the future is here
There's no brave England, no brave Russia, no America
(Ah-hah!)
Their sins come home to haunt us
From the wrong side of the gun

Who is that creepin' up the stairs in black?
It's a murderer Mama, knife you in the back
They come at night, and the world goes blind with fear
Terror in Paris, the future is here
Cry for them, cry for us, playing the game of death
(Ah hah!)
It's not a game when you are
Down to taking your last breath
(Whoah oh!)

They come at night Mama, just like before
Turn the streets to blood red rivers
Turn your eyes no more
They come at night, and the world goes blind with fear
Iron bars in Europe, the future is here
Those who survived that night are still completely traumatized
(Whoah oh!)
But the other souls unlucky
Shot like dogs between the eyes

There's no brave England, no brave Russia, no America
Their sins come home to haunt us
From the wrong side of the gun

12062,My Way,Sid Vicious,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
You cunt, I'm not a queer
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that¬¥s full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did, what I had to do
And saw it through with out exemption
I planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

There were times, I'm sure you knew
When there was fuck fuck fuck-all else to do
But through it all, when there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced the wall and the world
And did it my way

I've laughed and been a snide
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think, I killed a cat
And may I say, not in a gay way
Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a prat, what has he got
When he wears hats and he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words, of one who kneels
The record shows, I fucked a bloke
And did it my way

I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, Joe
You were standing in the middle of an open road
I had a dream, Joe
Your hands were raised up to the sky
And your mouth was covered in foam
I had a dream, Joe
A shadowy Jesus, he flitted from tree to tree
I had a dream, Joe
The society of whores stuck needles in an image of me
I had a dream, Joe
It was Autumn time and thickly fell the leaves
And in that dream, Joe
A pimp in seersucker suit sucked a toothpick
And pointed his finger at me

[Chorus]
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe

[Verse 2]
I opened my eyes, Joe
The night had been a giant, a-dribbling and pacing the boards
I opened my eyes, Joe
All your letters and cards all stacked up against the door
I opened my eyes, Joe
The morning light came slowly tumbling through the crack
In the window, Joe
And I thought of you, man
And I felt like I was lugging a body on my back

I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)

Where did you go, Joe?
On that endless, on that senseless, on that demented drift
Where did you go, Joe?
It was into the woods, it was into the trees
Where you move and shift
Where did you go, Joe?
All dressed up in your ridiculous seersucker suit
Where did you go, Joe?
With that strew of wreckage
Forever at the heel of your boot

12087,Bells & Circles,Underworld,"If I had wings
I wouldn't do anything beautiful and transcendent
No
I'd get my finger into everything I wanted
I'd do all the beautiful things
Those things you can't do
Because nobody wants you to be able to do
The things that make you feel good
Like you can't smoke on the airplane
I remember smoking on the airplane
I used to love to smoke on the airplane
Those were the golden days of air travel
They would just open the door at the airport
And you'd walk right out the tarmac
And up those stairs and light a big cigarette
And stick it in the ashtray
And the stewardess would come along
And if she was hot, you can try to pick her up
Once I was flying
From New York to DC
I didn't have much time
And the stewardess was smoking
She was a dusky tall
American beauty
And I put down my tray table
Snorted a gram of cocaine
Till I got up my courage to say
""Can I have your phone number?""
And she gave me the number
That was the good news
The bad news was I got too stoned and I'd lost the number
The stewardess would've been better than the cocaine
I made an error in judgement
But still I remember smoking on the airplane

Smoking on the airplane
Smoking on the airplane, everybody did it
They'd gather at the back on the way to Australia
And all puff up at once outside the bathroom
And that's why if I had wings
That would be a bad idea, hahahahaha, I guess
According to everything I've been taught about the laws of
Ethics and karma and good behavior, hahahahaha
If I had wings, I'd go, yum, yum, yum-yum, yum-yum, yum, ow!
I'd have fun
If I had wings, I'd have fun

Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren
Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday
Found it in the street
At first, I did not see
Lying at my feet a trampled rose

Passing the hat in church
It never stops going round
You never pay just once to get the job done
What I done to me
I done to you
So what happened to the trampled rose?

In the muddy street, with the fireworks and leaves
A blind man with a cup I asked
If he would sing ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine""
I know this rose like I know my name
The one I gave my love
It was the same
Now I find it in the street, a trampled rose

On Jubilee Street there was a girl named Bea
She had a history, but she had no past
When they shut her down, the Russians moved in
Now I'm too scared, I'm too scared to even walk on past

They ought to practice what they preach
Here they ought to practice just what they preach
Those good people on Jubilee Street
And here I come up the hill
I'm pushing my own wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain
And I'm pushing my wheel of love on Jubilee Street
Ah, look at me now

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well, a girl‚Äôs gotta make ends meet
Even down on Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time, and over the hill, and out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to practice what I preach
These days I go downtown in my tie and tails
I got a fetus on a leash
I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations
The curtains are shut, the furniture is gone
I‚Äôm transforming, I‚Äôm vibrating, I‚Äôm glowing
I‚Äôm flying, look at me now
I‚Äôm flying, look at me now

12092,Fire Is Coming,Flying Lotus,"[Spoken Word: David Lynch]
The yellow phone on the wall started ringing. Tommy jumped, then ran across the kitchen and picked up the receiver. ""Hello?"" he said, a little out of breath. Tommy's father was downstairs in the basement wood shop cutting a piece of clear pine on the table saw. The sound of the saw was screechingly loud, and a big plume of agitated sawdust was forming in the air. Tommy's mother was outside on the front lawn tending to a small flower garden. She was visibly upset about her flowers' condition. She was observing a black film on the stems and leaves, then trying to wipe this black substance away while running hose water on it, but it was too greasy, and the water wasn't washing it away. The front door opened and Tommy appeared behind his mother. ""Mom, there's a phone call for you."" Tommy's mom stood up and turned, the garden hose in her right hand shooting water. ""Who is it?"" she asked. ""I don't know. It's a man. He said you would know what it's about."" Tommy's mom stood frozen for a moment, and Tommy saw lines of worry racing across her face. Something else scrambled into Tommy's awareness. He saw that the sky was noticeably darker than usual, and he saw a huge, red-orange glow moving on the horizon. Just then, a man appeared running frantically in the street, the man yelling, ""Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming!""

[Chorus]
There's a fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move your feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move your feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet

12090,Romeo Had Juliette,Lou Reed,"[Verse 1]
Caught between the twisted stars
The plotted lines the faulty map
That brought Columbus to New York
Betwixt between the East and West
He calls on her wearing a leather vest
The earth squeals and shudders to a halt
A diamond crucifix in his ear
Is used to help ward off the fear
That he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Inside his pants he hides a mop
To clean the mess that he has dropped
Into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell

[Chorus]
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo

[Verse 2]
Romeo Rodriguez squares
His shoulders and curses Jesus
Runs a comb through his black pony-tail
He's thinking of his lonely room
The sink that by his bed gives off a stink
Then smells her perfume in his eyes
And her voice was like a bell

[Verse 3]
Outside the streets were steaming
The crack dealers were dreaming
Of an Uzi someone had just scored
I betcha I could hit that light
With my one good arm behind my back
Says little Joey Diaz
Brother give me another toke
Those downtown hoods are no damn good
Those Italians need a lesson to be taught
This cop who died in Harlem
You think they'd get the warnin'
I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street

[Chorus]
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo

[Verse 4]
I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag
With Latin written on it that says
""it's hard to give a shit these days""
Manhattan's sinking like a rock
Into the filthy Hudson what a shock
They wrote a book about it
They said it was like ancient Rome
The perfume burned his eyes
Holding tightly to her thighs
And something flickered for a minute
And then it vanished and was gone
"
12095,Octopus,Syd Barrett,"[Verse 1]
Trip to heave and ho
Up down, to and fro'
You have no word
Trip, trip to a dream dragon
Hide your wings in a ghost tower
Sails cackling at every plate we break
Cracked by scattered needles
The little minute gong coughs and clears his throat
Madam you see before you stand
Hey ho, never be still
The old original favorite grand
Grasshoppers green Herbarian band
And the tune they play is ""In Us Confide""
So trip to heave and ho
Up down, to and fro'
You have no word

[Chorus]
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

[Verse 2]
Isn't it good to be lost in the wood
Isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood
Meant even less to me than I thought
With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed ...
Well, the madcat laughed
At the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the Talbot
""Cheat"" he cried shouting kangaroo
It's true in their tree they cried

[Chorus]
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

[Verse 3]
The madcat laughed
At the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the Talbot
The winds they blew and the leaves did wag
They'll never put me in their bag
The seas will reach and always seep
So high you go, so low you creep
The wind it blows in tropical heat
The drones they throng on mossy seats
The squeaking door will always creak
Two up, two down we'll never meet
So merrily trip forgo my side

[Chorus]
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

This night you are mistaken
I'm a farmer in the city
Dark farm houses 'gainst the sky
Every night I must wonder why
Harness on the left nail
Keeps wrinkling, wrinkling
Then higher above me
Esau, Esau
Can't go by a man  from Rio
Go by a man from Vigo
Can't go by a man  from Ostia
Hey, Ninetto
Remember that dream?
We talked about it so many times

And if I'm not mistaken
We can search from farm to farm
Dark farm houses 'gainst our eyes
Every night I must realize
Harness on the left nail
Keeps withering and withering
Then higher above me
Esau, Esau
Can't go by a man in this shirt
Go by a man in that shirt
Can't go by a man with brain grass
Go by his long long eye gas
And I used to be a citizen
And I never felt the pressure
I knew nothing of the horses
Nothing of the thresher
Paolo, take me with you?
It was the journey of a life

[Chorus]
Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21
Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21

What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to

And your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're lookin' for romance or

Well, from 1984

I wish you'd stop ignorin' me
Because it's sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair

And no, there in't no love, no
Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness

Well, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're lookin' for romance or
I don't know what you're lookin' for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor

Said, from 1984

There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die
My fading voice sings of love
But she cries to the clicking of time, oh, time

[Chorus]
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire

[Verse 2]
And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow, oh my love
And the rain is falling and I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain I might leave, leave behind

[Chorus]
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire

I might leave, leave behind
And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow

Wait, wait, wait in the fire, wait in the fire

Everybody knows me now

Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

12053,The Black Angel's Death Song,The Velvet Underground,"[Verse 1]
The myriad choices of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
What had he to lose?
Not a ghost bloodied country all covered with sleep
Where the Black Angel did weep not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

[Verse 2]
And wandering's brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull
Shrill yell
Shining brightly red-rimmed and redlined with the time
Effused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

[Verse 3]
Cut mouth bleeding razors
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains coo goodbye
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gonna choose, choose again

[Verse 4]
Sacrificials remain make it hard to forget
Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize pain
Choose again
And Robermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
With the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

[Verse 5]
And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
And if the stone glances off, split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose
If you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
Start the game

I che che, che che I
Che che che, ka tah koh
Choose to choose
Choose to choose, choose to go

Can you feel it coming in the air tonight? Oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 1]
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

Well, I remember, I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time

But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
Well, the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

South of the path
Of totality
South of the path
Of totality

[Verse 2]
When Shiner was just a mini boy
His science teacher thought he might enjoy
A shadowbox of empty Captain Crunch
So he could watch the eclipse after lunch
Standing out on the Snake Canyon rim
He's staring up and she's staring at him
Wondering where his mind has run
Waiting for the moon to shield the sun

[Chorus]
South of the path
Of totality
South of the path
Of totality

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's getting dimmer, a chill is in the air
Baffled flies are buzzing everywhere
Armed with his plastic swatter sword
Pops battles so he won't be bored
The Cheshire Cat dodges behind the moon
An eerie haze glooms the afternoon
Lafawnduh's primed and ready for her run
As the moon chases away the sun

[Chorus]
South of the path
Of totality

12126,Axolotl,The Veils,"[Verse]
I'm glowing bright, obsidian
Axolotl amphibian
Un-elemental chemical
Got me growing six black tentacles
A little nightmarish, a little maudlin
Good golly go get that kid some laudanum
Salvation's more than I can afford
Who needs the Devil when you've got the Lord?

[Chorus]
Oh my soul
Losing control
Who built this heart?
Oh my God

[Verse]
Now sister Maggie's coming in fleet-foot
Baby's got a belly full of black soot
I got the feeling I better just stay put
And she'll love you better than any real man could
An accidental amphibian
I'm growing giddy as a Gideon
Another head for the chopping board
Who needs the Devil when you've got the Lord?

[Chorus]
Oh my soul
Losing control
Who built this heart?
Oh my God
"
12100,Red Right Hand,PJ Harvey,"[Verse 1]
Take a little walk to the edge of town
Go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand

[Verse 2]
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand
"
12120,Snake Eyes,Trouble,
12130,Paper Tiger,Beck,"[Verse 1]
Just like a paper tiger
Torn apart by idle hands
Through the helter skelter morning
Fix yourself while you still can
No more ashes to ashes
No more cinders from the sky
Let all the laws of creation
Tell a dead man how to die

[Chorus]
Oh, deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

[Verse 2]
Looking through a broken diamond
To make the past what it should be
Through the ruins and the weather
Capsized boats in the sea

[Chorus]
Oh, deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

[Bridge]
We're just holding on to nothing
To see how long nothing lasts

[Chorus]
Oh, deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

[Outro]
There's one road to the morning
There's one road to the truth
There's one road back to civilization
But there's no road back to you
"
12128,Dawn Chorus,Thom Yorke,"Back up the cul-de-sac
Come on, do your worst
You quit your job again
And your train of thought
If you could do it all again
A little fairy dust
A thousand tiny birds singing
If you must, you must
Please let me know
When you‚Äôve had enough
Of the white light
Of the dawn chorus
If you could do it all again
You don't know how much
Pronto pronto, moshi mosh
Come on, chop chop

If you could do it all again
Yeah, without a second thought
I don't like leaving
The door shut
I think I missed something
But I'm not sure what
In the middle of the vortex
The wind picked up
Shook up the soot
From the chimney pot
Into spiral patterns
Of you, my love

You take a little piece
Then you break it off
It's a bloody racket
It‚Äôs the dawn chorus
If you could do it all again
Big deal, so what?
Please let me know
When you've had enough
It's the last chance
O.K. Corral
If you could do it all again
This time with style

12110,Rides Through The Morning,Michael Nau,"[Verse 1]
Farm away hose sad eyes
I swim for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Your light to touch the song back to my soul
Go by the breeze, I'm bound to pine
You will always come to mine
And rescue my dream down this marvelous stream
Where holy waters overflow

[Chorus]
For good the ship rides through the morning
When the darkness drowns all
Beyond the shell somebody‚Äôs burning
You know it's calling, you know it's calling me back home
Put down your sorrows and dance with me
That worried mind in a trance to me
The stars that swim across your brows
Waiting through this night I scout
We made a real romance
Put down your sorrows and dance with me

[Verse 1]
Beside your shadow there‚Äôs a painting
That died, ooh you're a lovely flower
Here comes the spring
Let it touch the song back in my soul
And if by this bridge I piss and pine
This feeling always, always, always, always comes to mind
Every time that your song goes back into my soul

[Chorus]
Alas the ship rides through the morning
When the darkness aptly grows
Now every bit of the, bit of the, bit of the, bit of the sun is shining
I feel it calling, feel it calling me back home
Put down your sorrows and dance with me
That worried mind in a trance to me
The stars that swim across your brows
Waiting through this night I scout
We made a real romance with me
Put down your sorrows and dance with me
Oh put down your sorrows and dance with me
Oh put down your sorrows and dance with me
Oh put down your sorrows and dance with me

12127,A Real Indication,Thought Gang,"So I'm goin' down this street
And I'm tryin' not to smile
'Cause the street is where I'm goin'
And the curb is at the side
By the sewer
Where the rain goes down

Like this girl I once knew
'Cause the sewer is so hollow
And the yell
Could last forever

Like the night my girl went away
Gone off in a world filled with stuff
Lights start changin'
And there's wires in the air
And the asphalt man
Is all around me

And I look down
And my shoes are so far away from me, man
I can't believe it

I got a real indication
Of a laugh comin' on
I got a real indication
Of a laugh comin' on

That old wind
Is howling like a cold steel train
Girl has left me
Not comin' back again

Got rusted bullet holes in the Dodge
And a heartburn like a solar flare
The grass by the house is dry, man

And a horsefly
Buzzes, buzzes, buzzes
By the big mistake In the distance, man
I see myself, I see myself start to smile

I got a real indication (He-ha, he-ha, he-ha-ha-ha)
Of a laugh comin' on

So I'm going down this street
And I'm trying not to smile

Gone off in a world filled with stuff

And you can't sleep

You're sitting down to dress, and you're a mess
You look in the mirror

You look in your eyes
Say you realize

Everybody goes, leaving those
Who fall behind

Everybody goes, as far as they can
They don't just care

They stood on the stairs
Laughing at your airs

Your mother's dead, she said
""Don't be afraid""

Your mother's dead, you're on your own
She's in her bed

Everybody goes, leaving those
Who fall behind

Everybody goes, as far as they can
They don't just care

You're a wasted face, you're a sad-eyed lie
You're a holocaust

Father Vivian O'Blivion resplendent in his frock
Was whipping up the batter for the pancakes of his flock

Cause the night before, behind the door
A leprechaun had stroked it
The night before, behind the door
A leprechaun had stroked (He stroked it)
The night before, behind the door
A leprechaun had stroked his spot (stroked his spot)

Which set him off in such a frenzy
He sang ""Lock Around The Crock""
An' he topped it off with a‚Äî
An' he topped it off with a‚Äî
An' he topped it off with a‚Äî
As he stumbled on his‚Äî
He was delighted as it stiffened
And ripped right through his sock

Am I who you think about in bed

You've got this new head filled up with smoke
And I've got my veins all tangled close
To those jukebox bars you frequent
The safest place to hide
A long night spent with your most obvious weakness, you start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want

12129,Jigsaw Falling Into Place,Radiohead,"[Verse 1]
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

[Verse 2]
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
A jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, and you look back
Not just once, and not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place

12145,"Build God, Then We'll Talk",Panic! At The Disco,"[Verse 1]
It's these substandard motels on the, la-la-la-la-la
Corner of 4th and Fremont Street
Appealing only 'cause they're just that unappealing
Any practiced Catholic would cross themselves upon entering
The rooms have a hint of asbestos
And maybe just a dash of formaldehyde
And the habit of decomposing
Right before your very, la-la-la-la, eyes

[Chorus]
Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

[Post-Chorus]
Tonight's tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday
The missus will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money
A wonderful caricature of intimacy
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
And not to mention the constable
And his proposition for that ""virgin""
Yes, the one the lawyer met with on ""strictly business""
As he said to the missus
Well, only hours before, after he had left
She was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a ""purse"" of a different kind

[Chorus]
Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

[Bridge]
There are no
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

[Chorus]
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

[Bridge]
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains

And the sleeping with the roaches and the taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

12119,Lords of the Backstage,Marillion,"A love song with no validity
Pretend you never meant that much to me
Numb, a vallium child, bored by meaningless collisions
A lonely stretch of headlight, diamonds trapped in black ice
A mirror cracked along the white lines
I just wanted you to be the first one
I just wanted you to be the first one
Ashes are burning, burning
Ashes are burning, burning
A lifestyle with no simplicities
But I'm not asking for your sympathies
Talk, we never could talk, distanced by all that was between us
A lord of the backstage, a creature of language
I'm so far out and I'm too far in
I just wanted you to be the first one
I just wanted you to be the first one
Bridges are burning, burning
Bridges are burning, burning
Now, now, now, now

I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way

For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay, I'm not okay, hey hey, hey
I'm not okay, hey, hey
You wear me out

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)

I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

[Verse 1]
How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror
So how do you choose?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

[Verse 2]
Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this every day and all day?
Now how did we wind up this way
Watching our mouths for the words that we say?
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes or the soles that we choose
How do we get there today
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

And while she looks so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her

I've got my blade, gonna put it where his heart is

First of all, there is no god
Cause I went out and killed my god
And laid his body in the dirt
I killed him clean, so it did not hurt

And now the moon is full
The moon is wide
The moon it makes, waters rise

And weave the waves, in the deep
The kind of calm, I hope to keep

Celebrities who want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talking about how hard life can be

I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall, they would fall, fall...

They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

Well, did you know if you were famous you could
Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were
Smoking crack, McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.‚Äã

As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never goin', never showin' up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearin' ""act your age""

[Chorus]
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

[Verse 2]
Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense, and
Cuttin' people down is just a minor offense, then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn

Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Don't count on me

Well, I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothin'
You be standin' on the corner talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffin'
'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringin' off the hook
You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion

[Chorus]
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she say

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

[Pre-Chorus]
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Bridge]
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

[Chorus]
And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Outro]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
In the place we used to start our lives

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

12137,My Own Worst Enemy,Lit,"[Verse 1]
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me
Please tell me

[Chorus]
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard, and I'm
Sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone

[Verse 2]
It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going off, and there's a cigarette
Still burning

[Chorus]
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard, and I'm
Sleeping with my clothes on
Came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone

My car is in the front yard, and I'm

12168,Sex & Candy,Marcy Playground,"[Verse 1]
Hanging around, downtown by myself
And I had so much time to sit and think about myself
And then there she was, like double cherry pie
Yeah, there she was, like disco super-fly

I smell sex and candy here, mmm
Who's that lounging in my chair? Mmm
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
Momma this surely is a dream, yeah

Tied to me tight, tie me up again

Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock, and sweet you roll

12160,Drops of Jupiter,Train,"[Verse 1]
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracin' her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, yeah
Now that she's back in the atmosphere, I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Chorus]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (Light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

Fall for a shooting star?

12173,Walkin' On The Sun,Smash Mouth,"[Verse 1]
It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack, I know it went out but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it
Just to stay in the clique

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

[Verse 2]
Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression, and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened?
Then some were spellbound, some were hell-bound, some, they fell down
And some got back up and fought back against the meltdown
And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

[Organ Solo]

[Verse 3]
It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

[Outro]
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies while the slaves are all workin'

12156,Photograph,Nickelback,"[Verse 1]
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

[Verse 2]
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
Every time I do, it makes me

12193,Numb,Linkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

12176,The Way,Fastball,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They made up their minds and they started packing
And left before the sun came up that day
An exit to eternal summer slacking
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Verse 2]
They drank up the wine and they got to talking
But now had more important things to say
And when the car broke down, they started walking
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
They'll never get hungry
They'll never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home, but they really don't care
They wanted the highway
They're happier there today, today

[Verse 3]
The children woke up, and they couldn't find them
They left before the sun came up that day
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em (Leavin' it all behind)
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold

12151,Tounge Tied,Faber Drive,"Bright cold silver moon
Tonight alone in my room
You were here just yesterday
Slight turn of a head
Eyes down when you said
I guess I need my life to change
Seems like some things just aren't the same
What could I say

I need a little more luck than a little bit
Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit
And every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by
I need a little more help than a little bit
Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet
Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by this time

I stare up at the stars
I wonder just where you are
You feel a million miles away
(I wonder just where you are)
Was it something I said
Or something I never did
Or was I always in the way
(Was it something I did)
Can someone tell me what to say
To just make you stay

I need a little more luck than a little bit
Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit
And every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by
I need a little more help than a little bit
Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet
Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by this time

Now it feels like the end
Don't wanna be here again
And we could help each other
Off the ground so we never fall down again
And what it takes I don't care
We're gonna make it I swear
And we could help each other
Off the ground so we never fall down again
Again

I need a little more luck than a little bit
Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit
But every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by
I need a little more help than a little bit
Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet
Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by this time

Now it feels like the end
Don't wanna be here again
And we could help each other
Off the ground so we never fall down again
And what it takes I don't care
We're gonna make it I swear

12182,It's Not Over,Daughtry,"[Verse 1]
I was blown away
What could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything
And I can't deal with that
I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
We'll blow it away, blow it away

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

[Chorus]
Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

[Verse 2]
I've taken all I could take
And I cannot wait
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on
Can't let it bring us down
My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
I'll blow it away, blow it away

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

We can't let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself
Let it out

12181,Hey Leonardo,Blessid Union Of Souls,"[Verse 1]
She don't care about my car
And she don't care about my money
And that's real good 'cause I don't got a lot to spend
But if I did, it wouldn't mean nothing

[Chorus]
She likes me for me
Not because I look like Tyson Beckford
With the charm of Robert Redford
Oozing out my ears
But what she sees
Are my faults and indecisions
My insecure conditions
And the tears upon the pillow that I shed

[Verse 2]
She don't care about my big screen
Or my collection of DVD's
Things like that just never mattered much to her
Plus she don't watch too much TV
And she don't care that I can fly her
To places she ain't never been
But if she really wants to go
I think deep down she knows that
All she has to say is when

[Chorus]
She likes me for me
Not because I hang with Leonardo
Or that guy who played in ""Fargo""
I think his name is Steve
She's the one for me
And I just can't live without her
My arms belong around her
And I'm so glad I found her once again
And I'm so glad I found her once again
Yeah, I'm so glad I found her once again (Come on)

[Bridge]
Gazing at the ceiling
As we entertain our feelings in the dark
The things that we're afraid of
Are gonna show us what we're made of in the end

[Chorus 2]
She likes me for me
Not because I sing like Pavarotti
Or because I'm such a hottie
I like her for her
Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford
She has got so much to offer
Why does she waste all her time with me?
There must be something there that I don't see
I don't see

[Chorus]
She likes me for me
Not because I'm tough like Dirty Harry
Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey
Unlike the ""Cable Guy""
But what she sees
Is that I can't live without her
My arms belong around her
And I'm so glad I found her once again
(She likes me for me)
Found her once again (She likes me for me)
Once again (She likes me for me)
Yeah, I'm so glad I found her once again

12158,Better Days,The Goo Goo Dolls,"[Verse 1]
And you ask me what I want this year
And I try to make this kind and clear
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
'Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
And designer love and empty things
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

[Chorus]
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

[Verse 2]
I need someplace simple where we could live
And something only you can give
And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child who saved this world
And there's 10 million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them

[Chorus]
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

[Bridge]
I wish everyone was loved tonight
And somehow stop this endless fight
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

[Chorus]
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

12150,Jenny,The Click Five,"[Verse 1]
She calls me ""Baby""
Then she won't call me
Says she adores me
And then ignores me
Jenny, what's the problem?
She keeps her distance
And sits on fences
Puts up resistance
And builds defenses
Jenny, what's the problem?

You leave me hangin' on the line
Every time you change your mind

[Chorus]
First you say you won't
Then you say you will
You keep me hangin' on
And we're not movin' on
Or standin' still
Jenny, you've got me on my knees
Jenny, it's killin' me

She needs her own space
She's playin' mind games
Ends up at my place
Sayin' that she's changed
Jenny, what's the problem?

You got me goin' out of my mind

She lays down on the fresh lawn
She can make everything magical
But she tied one on big time

12175,One Headlight,The Wallflowers,"[Verse 1]
So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

[Verse 2]
I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

[Bridge]
Hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

[Verse 4]
She said, ""It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade""
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

[Verse 5]
And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

[Bridge]
Hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 6]
Well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
What smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

[Verse 7]
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home

I tear my heart open‚ÄîI sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 1]
I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just want to be alone
I'm pissed 'cause you came around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause I've channeled all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is:

Against my own advice
I saw you goin' down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
And I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I left my heart open
But you didn‚Äôt understand
(But you didn‚Äôt understand)
Go fix yourself!

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life

I tear my heart open‚ÄîI sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much

12199,Higher,Creed,"[Verse 1]
When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher

Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high, I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Set up high, I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
""I wanna get out of this""
I wonder is there anything
I'm gonna miss

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there?
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to?
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around?
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

And how's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore?
And how's it going to be?
Wanna get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I wanna taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion (Oblivion)

How's it going to be?
When you don't know me anymore?
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

And emeralds from mountains that thrust towards the sky

12177,Barely Breathing,Duncan Sheik,"[Verse 1]
I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day

And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me

12164,Only Wanna Be with You,Hootie & The Blowfish,"[Verse 1]
You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry

[Refrain]
Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

[Verse 2]
You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I moan and pout at you until I get my way

You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get

Only when I stop to think about it

Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied, without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

[Verse 2]
You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face

So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel

And you could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I will save you from all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are

12184,When I'm Gone,3 Doors Down,"[Verse 1]
There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind

[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good

Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

When your education x-ray
Cannot see under my skin

That I could not tell my friends
Roaming through this darkness

And part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

12165,Every Morning,Sugar Ray,"[Verse 1]
Every mornin' there's a halo hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again, as predicted, left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reelin', stopped me from believin'
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it, you know I wanna do it again

[Chorus]
(Sugar Ray say) Oh
(Every mornin') Oh (Every mornin' when I wake up)
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Oh (She always rights the wrong)
Oh (She always rights, she always rights)
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)

[Verse 2]
Every mornin' there's a heartache hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Somethin' so deceiving, when you stop believin'
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it, you know I wanna do it again

[Chorus]
Oh
(Every mornin') Oh (Every mornin' when I wake up)
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Oh (Every mornin' when I wake up)

She always rights the wrong
For me, baby
She always rights the wrong

12167,Inside Out,Eve 6,"[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Wanna put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

[Verse 1]
I burn, burn like a wicker cabinet
Chalk white and oh-so-frail
I see our time has gotten stale
The tick-tock of the clock is painful
All sane and logical
I wanna tear it off the wall
I hear words in clips and phrases
I think sick like ginger ale
My stomach turns and I exhale

[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Wanna put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

[Verse 2]
So-Cal is where my mind states
But it's not my state of mind
I'm not as ugly, sad as you
Or am I origami
Folded up and just pretend
Demented as the motives in your head

[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Wanna put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you
(Rendezvous)

[Bridge]
I alone am the one you don't know you need
Take heed, feed your ego
Make me blind when your eyes close
Sink when you get close, tie me to the bedpost
I alone am the one you don't know you need
You don't know you need me
Make me blind when your eyes close
Tie me to the bedpost

[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
The lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothing but faith in nothing
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through, now I'm through with you

[Outro]
Through with you
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

This is my life
It's not what it was before
All these feelings I've shared
And these are my dreams
That I'd never lived before
Somebody shake me, 'cause I
I must be sleeping

[Chorus]
And now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
And all the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

[Verse 2]
And these are my words
That I've never said before
I think I'm doing okay
And this is the smile
That I've never shown before
Somebody shake me 'cause I
I must be sleeping

Now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
And all the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

[Bridge]
I'm so afraid of waking
Please don't shake me
Afraid of waking
Please don't shake me

[Chorus]
Now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
All the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

Well, she said, ""It's cold outside"" and she hands me my raincoat
She's always worried 'bout things like that
Well, she said, ""It's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault""

[Pre-Chorus]
And she only sleeps when it's rainin'
And she screams and her voice is strainin'

And she says, ""Baby
It's 3 AM, I must be lonely""
When she says, ""Baby
Well, I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe it""

Well, she believes that life isn't made up of all that you're used to
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway, yeah
But outside, it's stopped rainin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, but she says, ""Baby
Well, it's 3 AM, I must be lonely""
Yeah, when she says, ""Baby,"" ah yeah, yeah
""Well, I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this
Well, it's 3 AM, I must be lonely"" (I must be lonely)
Well, yeah, when she says, ""Baby
Well, I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes""

Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

[Pre-Chorus]
In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

[Chorus]
She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no

12155,Over You,Daughtry,"[Verse 1]
Now that it's all said and done
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up, then tear me down
Like an old abandoned house
And what you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath
I fell too far, was in way too deep
Guess I let you get the best of me

[Chorus]
Well, I never saw it coming
I shoulda started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally getting better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you

[Verse 2]
You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags and walked away
There was nothing I could say
And when you slammed the front door shut
A lot of others opened up
So did my eyes so I could see
That you never were the best for me

[Chorus]
Well, I never saw it coming
I shoulda started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you

You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong

I think you're already leavin'
Feels like your hand is on the door

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She was sitting at the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, but a black day
I could make a salutation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

Annie, are you okay
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by, you've been struck by a smooth criminal

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane

You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today

12179,Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,"[Verse 1]
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

[Pre-Chorus]
You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland

Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)

And smile at the thought of me failing

How does it feel
To treat me like you do?

And told me who you are?

Just how I should feel today

To the centre of the city where all roads meet
Waiting for you
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank
Searching for you
I was moving through the silence without motion
Waiting for you
In a room with a window in the corner
I found truth

[Verse 2]
In the shadowplay, acting out your own death
Knowing no more
As the assassins all grouped in four lines
Dancing on the floor
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies
Made a move to connect
But I could only stare in disbelief
As the crowds all left

I did everything, everything I wanted to
I let them use you for their own ends
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you

And furthermore, Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that all four of them habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes... Reefers

I smoke two joints in the morning

I smoke two joints in the afternoon, it makes me feel alright
I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of war
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more

Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!

Abandoned too soon, set down with due care

She turns me on like a firecracker in the summer sun

I can feel my mind
Slowly fading with the smell of her perfume
And when she's dancing
Oh damn
Mm-mmm

[Instrumental]

I'm feeling my heart
Beating with the rhythm of her body slowly moves
I love this feeling
Mm-mmm
Yeah, yeah

Well I can't deny it, mm
She turns me on and I can't control this burning desire
I wish we could
Have some fun under the sun

I don't know what it is but there is a trick in her
Who works on me
So well
And I can't deny it, mm
She turns me on like a firecracker in the summer sun

I can feel my mind
Slowly fading with the smell of her perfume
And when she's dancing
Oh damn
Mm-mmm

She turns me on
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene
With a gangsta lean, wooh-ooh
She turns me on
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene
With a gangsta lean, wooh-ooh

She turns me on
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene
With a gangsta lean, wooh-ooh
She turns me on
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene
With a gangsta lean, wooh-ooh

She turns me on

12228,Ghost,Motorama,"[Verse 1]
My hopes, my will
Were never a part of you
Those days were sad and cold
I'll never want them back again

[Chorus]
But in this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillow

[Verse 2]
Your voice is pure and soft
It's throwing me back to my hopes
My ears were deaf and cold
Please hold me tight in your arms again

[Chorus]
But in this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillow

But in this moment we are close to each other again

Damn!
What's this, baby?
I thought this was a summer thing
Me and you? You and me?
You messin' up my stroll!
Don't you know they call me Miss Cherry?

[Verse 1:]
It started in June
Just when I thought that I had washed my hands
Gave up on love

Yo, where the fuck you come from, babe?
And who said I needed a man?
This supposed to be my time to be alone
But I'm with you instead

Never break my heart
Oh, baby, I swear
I swear, darling, if you do I'll hurt you bad
Tear your world apart

Never break my heart
Oh, baby, I swear
I swear, darling, if you do I'll hurt you bad
Tear your world apart

Was having the time of my prime
My little black book was starting to glow
But there you go saying how you love me so
Done interrupted my pimp flow!
And I've contradicted everything I ever said
About falling in love again
Oh, baby, it's a threat I see, tell you honestly
That you better make sure you take good care of me

She scares them all
She‚Äôs far too pretty
For that dancing hall

It shook the stage
A cannonball
Dave almost fell
But she took the fall

For him
For him

Ann wants to dance
I do recall
Her freckled face
Glowing down the hall

Between her legs
A waterfall
Ann wants to yell
She can only moan

For him
For him

Ann wants to dance
She scares them all
She‚Äôs far too pretty
For that dancing hall

It shook the stage
A cannonball
Dave almost fell
But she took the fall

For him

12225,Different State of Mind,Kid Bloom,"Sinking right into the crimson clouds
Waiting for this thing to spin me out
I'm swimming in my head
Mouth so dry, I could crack my tongue
Jaw hanging like an accordion
Let's hope nobody stares

It was a different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind

Give me a reason and I will hold your
Strawberry-flavored lightning bolt
Like everybody else
I can't reach the counter, but I feel tall
You're standing naked in your overalls, tonight
I'm someone else

It was a different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind

She knows what I bring
She tells me to say it
She knows what I bring
And that's where I'll find

A different state of mind

A different state of mind
A different state of mind

Ah, it was a different state of mind
It was a different state of mind

Were you thinking of me when you kissed him?
Could you taste me when you licked his skin?
All the while I showered you with trust and promises

To get back all that I lost then

Adrienne, I should have left you
Long before you used me, used me up

But in my sky all burnt out you are
And I'll have the last laugh
When I see you walking with some other guy
'Cause I know you're gonna end up all alone

So take these words, some good advice
All you've done's gonna come back twice
You never cared how much it hurt, I really need to tell you

12210,Wrong Way,Sublime,"[Verse 1]
Annie's twelve years old, in two more, she'll be a whore
Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way
Don't be afraid with the quickness you get laid
For your family, get paid, it's the wrong way

[Hook 1]
I gave her all that I had to give
I'm gonna make it hard to live
Salty tears running down to her chin
And it ruins up her makeup and never wan' give

[Verse 2]
A cigarette pressed between her lips
But I'm staring at her tits, it's the wrong way
Strong if I can, but I am only a man
So I take her to the can, it's the wrong way

[Hook 2]
The only family that she's ever had
Is her seven horny brothers and a drunk-ass dad
He needed money, so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine, until the day she met me

[Verse 3]
Happy are you sad, wanna shoot your dad?
I'll do anything I can, the wrong way
We talk all night, tried to make it right
Believe me, shit was tight, it was the wrong way

[Hook 3]
Don't run away, if you wanna stay
'Cause I ain't here to make you, oh, no
It's up to you what you really want to do
Spend some time in America
Dub style!

[Trombone Solo]

[Hook 1]
She'll give you all that she's got to give
But I'm gonna make it hard to live
Big, salty tears rolling down to her chin
And it smears up her makeup an' never wan' give

[Verse 4]
So, we ran away and I'm sorry when I say
That straight to this very day it was the wrong way
She did the hike, don't matter if I like it, or not
Because she only wants the wrong way

[Hook 4]
I gave her all that I had to give
She still wouldn't take it, whoa, no
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve
And it still ruins her makeup, and never wan' give

[Verse 1]
On a thousand islands in the sea
I see a thousand people just like me
A hundred unions in the snow
I watch them walking, falling in a row
We live always underground
It's going to be so quiet in here tonight
There's a thousand islands in the sea
It's a shame

[Verse 2]
And a hundred years ago
A sailor trod this ground I stood upon
Take me away everyone
When it hurts thou

[Chorus 1]
From my head to my toes
From the words in the book
I see a vision that would bring me luck
From my head to my toes
To my teeth, through my nose
You get these words wrong
You get these words wrong
Every time
You get these words wrong
I just smile

[Chorus 2]
But from my head to my toes
From my knees to my eyes
Every time I watch the sky
For these last few days leave me alone
But for these last few days leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Share some greased tea with me

Could be the smallest of signs
We'll never know what they are or care
In its escapable view
There's no escape, so few in fear
Give in a changing value

[Verse 2]
To be given your sight
Hid in a long peaceful night
A nervous bride for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A love that's wrong from your life and soul
A savage mine had begun
A long farewell to your love and soul
A long farewell to your soul

[Chorus]
Now I know what those hands would do
No looking back now, we're pushing through
We'll change these feelings, we'll taste, we'll see
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream

12240,Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,The Smiths,"[Verse 1]
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

[Chorus]
In my life, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care
If I live or die?

[Verse 2]
Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

[Chorus]
In my life, oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care
If I live or I die?

[Verse 3]
What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
""Oh, you've been in the house too long"", she said
And I naturally fled

[Chorus]
In my life, why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather
Kick in the eye?

[Verse 4]
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
""Oh, you've been in the house too long"", she said
And I naturally fled

[Chorus]
In my life, oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care
If I live or I die?

And Heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven is the whole of our hearts

There's too many kings
Wanna hold you down
And a world at the window
Gone underground

Where the sun don't shine
And a clock on the wall
And it counts my time

And Heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven is the whole of our hearts

There's a song on the air
With a 'love you' line
And a face in a glass
And it looks like mine

And I'm standing on ice when I say
That I don't hear planes
And I scream at the fools
Wanna jump my train

Were in my life just to get high on

Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you know
You know, you know

12205,Here Without You,3 Doors Down,"[Verse 1]
A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

[Chorus]
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

12203,Snuff,Slipknot,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

[Chorus 1]
So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

[Verse 2]
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

[Chorus 2]
So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

[Guitar solo]

Oh, oh

[Chorus 3]
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know

12232,Disorder,Joy Division,"[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
Lose sensation, spare the insults, leave them for another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away

[Verse 2]
It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, into no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow

[Verse 3]
What means to you, what means to me and we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from your friends
Who is right, who can tell and who gives a damn right now?
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know

[Outro]
I've got the spirit
But lose the feeling
I've got the spirit
But lose the feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling

Grace on the water
Lips like sugar, lips like sugar

It's a fashion with a gun, my love
In a room without a door
A kiss is not enough

[Chorus]
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

[Verse 2]
They'd put us on a railroad
They'd dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces and making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes
There's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all and take us all apart, but not

Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me around
I feel numb, born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it, the better
We'll make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground, head in the sky
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing

[Chorus 1]
Hi-yeah, I got plenty of time
Hi-yeah, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money, always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

[Verse 2]
Home is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from another
Did I find you or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be

[Chorus 2]
Hi-yeah, we drift in and out
Hi-yeah, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home and
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me 'til my heart stops
Love me 'til I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head, I go
Ooh

Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, ""It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care""

Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, ""Return the ring""

Just try to see in the dark, just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here

But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

And twenty-seven days, and I know

I know that I never, ever, oh, weh, woah
Had no one ever

12253,A Forest,The Cure,"[Verse 1]
Come closer and see
See into the trees
Find the girl
While you can
Come closer and see
See into the dark
Just follow your eyes
Just follow your eyes

I hear her voice
Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees
Into the trees

[Bridge]
Into the trees

[Verse 3]
Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again

12295,April Skies,The Jesus and Mary Chain,"[Verse 1]
Hey, honey, what you trying to say?
As I stand here, don't you walk away
And the world comes tumbling down
Hand in hand in a violent life
Making love on the edge of a knife
And the world comes tumbling down

[Chorus 1]
And it's hard for me to say
And it's hard for me to stay
I'm going down to be by myself
I'm going back for the good of my health
And there's one thing I couldn't do
Sacrifice myself to you
Sacrifice

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, I just can't see
Just what you mean to me
I take my aim and I fake my words
I'm just your longtime curse
And if you walk away
I can't take it

[Chorus 2]
But that's the way that you are
And that's the things that you say
But now you've gone too far
With all the things you say
Get back to where you come from
I can't help it, under the April skies
Under the April skies
Under the April sun
Under the April skies

[Bridge]
Under the April sun
Under the April sun
Under the April skies
Under the April sun

The sun grows cold, the sky gets black
And you broke me up and now you won't come back
Shaking hand, life is dead
And a broken heart and a screaming head
Hey, hey

It's easy to tease, but hard to get release

Into someone else's pocket, then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Ooh, the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down
Oh-oh-oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you and you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Billy Idol]
Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once so alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise

When I'm away from home
When I step out the door
The jungle is alive
I do not trust my ears
I don't believe my eyes

I will not fall in love
I cannot risk the bet
'Cause hearts are fragile toys
So easy to forget

It drags me when I walk
I smell it everywhere
It's just another day
Where people cling to light
To drive away the fear
That comes with every night

The voices in their ears
That will not go away

The world was set on fire
And everywhere I ran
There wasn't any water
The temperature increased
The sky was crimson red
The clouds turned into smoke
And everyone was dead

(But) There's a smile on my face...
For everyone
There's a golden coin...
That reflects the sun
There's a lonely place...
That's always cold
There's a place in the stars...
For when you get old

Oh, oh,‚Ä¶

That come out late at night
They always disappear
Before the morning light
I'm dreaming again
Of life underground
It doesn't ever move
It doesn't make a sound

And just when I think
That things are in their place
The heavens are secure
The whole thing explodes in my face

Picture this, if I could make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall
Did you?
And who are you? And how can I try?
Here inside, I like metal
Don't you?
All I know
Is no one dies
I'm still confusing love with need

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's really serious

12261,A Question of Lust,Depeche Mode,"[Verse 1]
Fragile, like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me, I'd never willingly do you harm
Apologies are all you seem to get from me
But just like a child, you make me smile when you care for me
And you know

[Chorus]
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

[Verse 2]
Independence is still important for us though
(We realise)
It's easy to make the stupid mistake of letting go
(Do you know what I mean?)
My weaknesses, you know each and every one
(It frightens me)
But I need to drink more than you seem to think before I'm anyone's
And you know

[Chorus]
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

[Bridge]
Kiss me goodbye when I'm on my own
But you know that I'd rather be home

[Chorus]
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust

It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

Water was running, children were running
You were running out of time
Under the mountain, a golden fountain
Were you praying at the Lares shrine?

[Chorus]
But, oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

Your former glories, and all the stories
Dragged and washed with eager hands

Hot and burning in your nostrils
Pouring down your gaping mouth
Your molten bodies, blanket of cinders
Caught in the throes, and

Wasted electricity

Every twist of mind

I know it's out of fashion
And a trifle uncool
But I can't help it
I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine
To watch the sun go down
On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down

[Chorus]
From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday

On a silent summer evening
The sky's alive with lights
A building in the distance
Surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach
Waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach
There's not a soul around

From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away

They're lighting my way tonight

The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights

My pleasure at being so wet
Here on my own, all on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight

The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
When my eyes had been so red
I'd been mistaken for dead

I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels

Don't, don't, don't throw it away

Throw it away
Throw it away

[Verse 2: Roland Orzabal & Curt Smith]
I made a fire and watching it burn
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past, now just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?
My mother and my brother's used to breathing clean air
Nothing ever changes when you‚Äôre acting your age
And dreaming I'm a doctor
Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby
It‚Äôs hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age
Oh, I feel so

[Chorus: Roland Orzabal]
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

12275,Pictures Of You,The Cure,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

[Verse 3]
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

[Verse 4]
Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

[Verse 5]
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels, so much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 6]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
And always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you

12285,Are 'Friends' Electric?,Tubeway Army,"[Verse 1]
It's cold outside
And the paint's peeling off of my walls
There's a man outside
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette

[Verse 2]
Now the light fades out
And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this
There's a knock on the door
And just for a second, I thought I remembered you

[Chorus]
So now I'm alone
Now I can think for myself
About little deals and S.U's
And things that I just don't understand
Like a white lie at night
Or a sly touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you

[Verse 3]
So I open the door
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway
""Please sit down""
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed

[Verse 4]
You know I hate to ask
But are 'friends' electric?
Only mine's broke down
And now I've no one to love

[Chorus]
So I found out your reasons for the phone calls and smiles
And it hurts and I'm lonely
And I should never have tried
And I missed you tonight
So it's time to leave
You see, it meant everything to me

There'll be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough from your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

[Chorus]
Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?

[Post-Chorus]
Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again and will you return it?

[Verse 2]
There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach
Oh, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

[Bridge]
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I won't say it again

But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

[Chorus]
So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

[Verse 3]
I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
And you've already gone away

[Bridge]
Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

[Chorus]
Now I would do 'most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

[Outro]
Boys don't cry

12292,(Feels Like) Heaven,Fiction Factory,"[Verse 1]
Heaven is closer now today
The sound is in my ears
I can't believe the things you say
They echo what I fear
Twisting the bones until they snap
I scream but no one knows
You say I'm familiar, cold to touch
And then you turn and go

[Chorus]
Feels like Heaven
Feels like Heaven

[Verse 2]
See how we planned for saddened eyes
And tears to pave the way
I fought the fever as I knew
My hair returned to gray
Study your face and fade the frame
Too close for comfort now
We can recall the harmony
That lingered but turned sour

[Chorus]
Feels like Heaven
Feels like Heaven

[Bridge]
You wanted all
I had to give
See me, I feel
See me, I live
Oh-oooh!

[Outro]
Feels like Heaven
Heaven is closer
Heaven is closer
Feels like Heaven
Heaven is closer
Heaven is closer
Feels like Heaven
Heaven is closer
Heaven is closer
Feels like Heaven
Heaven is closer
Heaven is closer
Feels like Hea-ven
Heaven is closer
Heaven is closer
Feels like Hea-ven
Heaven is closer

All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, 'cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world

[Verse 2]
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

[Chorus]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, 'cause I find it hard to take

Mad world

12300,Lucretia My Reflection,Sisters of Mercy,"I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down...
I hear empire down...

I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Love lost, fire at will
Dum-dum bullets and shoot to kill, I hear
Dive, bombers, and
Empire down...
Empire down...

I hear the sons of the city and dispossessed
Get down, get undressed
Get pretty but you and me
We got the kingdom, we got the key
We got the empire, now as then
We don't doubt, we don't take direction
Lucretia, my reflection, dance the ghost with me...

We look hard
We look through
We look hard
To see for real
Such things I hear, they don't make sense
I don't see much evidence
I don't feel
I don't feel
I don't feel

A long train held up by page on page
A hard reign held up by rage
Once a railroad
Now it's done...

I hear the roar of the big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down...

We got the empire, now as then
We don't doubt, we don't take reflection
Lucretia, my direction, dance the ghost with me...

12340,Romeo And Juliet,Dire Straits,"[Verse 1]
A lovestruck Romeo sings a streetsuss serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, ""You and me babe, how about it?""
Juliet says, ""Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gimme a heart attack""
He's underneath the window
She's singing, ""Hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?""

[Chorus 1]
""Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, when you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget
The movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet""

[Bridge]
Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?

[Verse 2]
Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything
You promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, ""Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him""

[Chorus 2]
""Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us
(You know the movie song)
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet""

[Verse 3]
""I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and the bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time""

""Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die

12323,Have A Nice Day,Bon Jovi,"[Verse 1]
Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away

[Chorus]
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

[Verse 2]
Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?

[Chorus]
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of public enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me

I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

You said you never heard of them (How cool is that?)

And read your diary
""Watching Grunge leg drop New Jack through a press table""
And then my heart stopped, ""Listening to Cio-Cio San
Fall in love all over again"" (Ow)

How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute?
Just come up to me and say hello to my heart
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say
""I'm falling for you""

[Verse 3]
I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes
Without shaking and I ain't faking
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon

I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting (Waiting, oh)

But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care

Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you

I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with Sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?

You can't leave me here alone
I‚Äôm just trying to do what‚Äôs right

Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Step back and watch the sweet thing
Breaking everything she sees
She can take my darkest feeling
Tear it up till I'm on my knees
Plug into her electric cool
Where things bend and break and shake to the rule
Talking fast couldn't tell me something
I would shed my skin for you
Talking fast on the edge of nothing
I would break my back for you
Don't know why, don't know why
Things vaporise and rise to the sky

[Chorus 1]
And we tried so hard
And we looked so good
And we lived our lives in black
But something about you felt like pain
You were my sunny day rain
You were the clouds in the sky
You were the darkest sky
But your lips spoke gold and honey
And that's why I'm happy when it rains
I'm happy when it pours

[Bridge]
Look at me enjoying something
That feels like, feels like pain
To my brain

[Verse 2]
And if I tell you something
You take me back to nothing
I'm on the edge of something
You take me back

And I'm happy when it rains

And I'm happy now

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

People cry and people moan
Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

I was so scared that you would leave so I hid it
I know we said that we'd always be honest
So now I went out and messed up, our nest
It finally seems like we've turned into strangers
Its gotten so bad there's just no more anger
So now it seems like we can't get no further
I can't believe I'll be bright for another

I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out we'll glow

Under the moon and with the girl that's in your place
And even Edison has no idea
Of all the blackouts I've caused you and me

With bright lights shining, it seems so right
Don't you know that
Things go nice with spice?

When the door broke open and let in
The light
So we ran to an empty space and felt so free
You know we‚Äôve never felt like this
Before

Hold out your hand
Don't you know that
This is the promised land?
With bright lights shining, it seems so right

Let into the world what's been hidden
From inside
Not covering what the day brings, it seems so right
Don't you know that this is the promised land?

12316,Out The Window,Violent Femmes,"Life was fun
Life was great
Til I made my big mistake
Oh no it'll never happen to me
Life was short
And life was sweet
I was thinking as I hit the street
I could hardly believe
I could scarcely conceive
But I had gone out the window
I had gone out the window
I had gone out the window
She was fine
She looked great
And so we made our big mistake
I swear I swear I swear
It'd never happen to her
But the pavement knocked her head around
When she hit the solid concrete ground
From thirty flights above
And she was thirty something loving nothing
Gone out the window
She had gone out the window
She had gone out the window
Oh, catch me if I'm falling
Catch me if I'm calling
He was smart he was wise
He'd profoundly philosophize
Empathy for all humanity
'til one day by an open window
There's a note that read
I've gone out the window - I'm dead
He said yes to life for all of his life
But then one day he said no
I gotta go out the window
We all go out the window
Catch me i am falling
Catch me I am calling
Catch me we are falling
Catch me we are calling

That night they were burnin' for truth
Down on the corner of 14th and U
They took your soul and they took you for fools
Took all the windows from prisons and schools
Now, what's a poor man left to do?
One heart now broken in two
You start untyin' the hand of the youth
New kids hear the sound of the drummin'
Mother nature, your summer is coming
Yesterday and today
Revolution on its way

Amen, it was the feast and the famine
Amen, it was the feast and the famine
It was the feast and the famine
Feast and the famine

[Verse 2]
Crossroads with nothing to lose
Out of the basement and into the news
Come change, now shit gettin' heavy
Salvation at the ready
You look when I walked by
Still screamin', ""'Til I die!""
You can't find peace if you can't find a home
You can't survive as an island alone
Black heart with a gaping wound
Put back together by a troubled groove
Check yourself, wrack your brains
Where is that P.M.A.?

Amen, it was the feast and the famine
Amen, it was the feast and the famine
It was the feast and the famine

At the bar near the Greyhound station
And the bare-chested boys are going down
On everything that their mama believes
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine
Help you feel not so strange

Said old Pa, ""She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
She's all tied to a chair""
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten

All the bubbas got their heads in a nod
They don't know what they love or deserve to get
Chances are that that worm in his lap
Doesn't even know which fish that he'd like to bite tonight
Oh, tonight, tonight, tonight, oh maybe tonight

Said old Pa, ""She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
She's all tied to a chair""

Cops are on the call
Weeding out the freaks
Fingers in the dirt
He's spitting out his teeth
Spitting out his teeth

Comes home on call, isn't that the peace
Fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth

Said old Pa, ""She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
As she's all tied to a chair""
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound

Give me the flammable life
I'm cold as a match, ready to strike
So here I go
Here lies a city on fire
Singin' along, the arsonist choir
Now here I go
It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now here I go
There is a river I found
Into the wild, under the ground
So here I go
A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now here I go, well

[Bridge]
Oh, sweet ignition, be my fuse
You have no choice, you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye, I'm on my way
But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go, well
Oh, sweet ignition, be my fuse
You had no choice, you had to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye, I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry, I could lie
You took my word, I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Lookin' for a dime and found a quarter

[Chorus]
But you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now ain't that's something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

You are my fuse
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse

Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again

Your signal in the distance

Where do I begin?

We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn?
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growin' stronger?
Little conquerors

Where do I begin?

I believe I've waited long enough

Now
For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free, again
To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside, a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice, but knowin' to survive
The first to climb another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die
I never wanna die, I never wanna die!
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die!
I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die!
I never wanna leave, I'll never say goodbye!
Forever! Whenever! Forever! Whenever!

Learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?

It's not a case of doing what's right

You expect me to act like a lover
Consider my moves and deserve the reward
To hold you in my arms and wait, and wait
And wait for something to happen

Some lines just fit the situation
You call me a liar, you would anyway
It's not a case of aiming to please
You know you're always crying

'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell!)

When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell

You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell

12308,Monkey Wrench,Foo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on plannin' my revenge

[Pre-Chorus]
One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

[Verse 2]
All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then, I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident

[Bridge]
One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than
I could fit into my head
I still remember every single word you said
And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still, there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free!

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench (Fall in, fall out)
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench (Fall in, fall out)
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench (Fall in, fall out)

12343,Adam's Song,blink-182,"[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone

12344,Drive,Incubus,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel the fear of
Uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh

[Verse 2]
So if I decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Ohh-oh-ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that
When I drive myself my light is found

[Chorus]
And whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh

Would you choose the water over wine
Hold the wheel and drive?

12352,When I Come Around,Green Day,"[Verse 1]
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

[Verse 2]
Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

When I come around

Get back on track, pick me up some bottles of booze
Fickle freshman, probably thinks she's cooler than you
A hay ride at 5, everybody's coming around
So go press your skirt, word is there's a new girl in town
I call shotgun, you can play your R&B tunes
The fellowship time, it always comes a little too soon
The land of the creeps, freshened up from baby-faced shave
Put your eyes on me and I know a place where we can get away

Just say, I want you
Just 'xactly like I used to
'Cause baby, this is only bringing me down

Homeboy's so proud, he finally got the video proof
The night vision shows she was only ducking the truth
It's heavy, I know, the black cat with the gift down below
A choke and a gag, she spit up and came back for more

She said, I want you
Just 'xactly like I used to
And baby, this is only bringing me down
She said, I want you

My friends they come
And the lines they go by

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

12355,Butterfly,Weezer,"[Verse 1]
Yesterday, I went outside
With my mama's mason jar
Caught a lovely butterfly
When I woke up today
Looked in on my fairy pet
She had withered all away
No more sighing in her breast

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away

[Verse 2]
Smell you on my hand for days
I can't wash away your scent
If I'm a dog, then you're a bitch
I guess you're as real as me
Maybe I can live with that
Maybe I need fantasy
Life of chasing butterfly

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away

When the robin makes his nest
But I ain't never coming back

I'll never see this place again
And you go stabbing yourself in the neck

[Bridge]
It's in the way that she posed
It's in the things that she puts in my head
Her stories are boring and stuff
She's always calling my bluff
She puts the, she puts the weights into my little heart
And she gets in my room and she takes it apart
She puts the weights into my little heart
I said she puts the weights into my little heart

She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away

It's a dead Russian, the papers say
But it would be nice if they realised
That she thought 'he is mine'

This town has got you down and I know
I was helping you out
While your hope died under northern skies and it shows
I was helping you to realise
The reason why, it was no surprise
No way

The act will pass by no-one
And I'm sad to say it's no different today
Be comforted by we share the same skies
And for once pay no mind

I have decided it's best that you know
I'm still thinking about
Old lies as north-west skies grow cold
No point in denying
Anxiety was my favourite feeling after jealousy
Yeah, I'll concede

That I could not
Be as nervous as I was
I could not
No way

This town has got you down and I know
I was helping you out
While your hope died under northern skies
And it shows
I was helping you to realise
The reason why, it was no surprise
No way

I can't shake this feeling I've got
My dirty hands, have I been in the wars?
The saddest thing that I'd ever seen were smokers outside the hospital doors

[Chorus]
Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?

[Verse 3]
How can we wear our smiles with our mouths wired shut
'Cause you stopped us from singing?

I can't shake this feeling I've got
My dirty hands, have I been in the wars?
The saddest thing that I'd ever seen were smokers outside the hospital doors

Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?
Now someone turn us around
Can we start this again?

We've all been changed from what we were
Our broken hearts left smashed on the floor
I can't believe you if I can't hear you
I can't believe you if I can't hear you

(We've all been changed from what we were
Our broken hearts smashed on the floor
We've all been changed from what we were
Our broken hearts smashed on the floor)

[Chorus]
Someone turn me around (We've all been changed from what we were)
Can I start this again? (Our broken hearts smashed on the floor)
Now someone turn us around (We've all been changed from what we were)
Can we start this again? (Our broken hearts smashed on the floor)

Playing ping pong over oceans, messing with emotions
Messing with my head
Messing with my head

13 hours ago, I'm no longer at home
Fast times in Tahoe
Three thousand miles away
What can i say
Fast times fast times to fast for me

And I don't care what you say
To get me out of the way
I got to get my message through to you

Baby,baby,baby,baby,baby,baby,baby

12370,Plastic Machinery,The Charlatans,"I too feel the plastic machinery
I know it's hard to be accepted
Our life is just like a dream to me
At times it's good to be rejected

So, let's just run
Even if
Only in our heads
Leave all of this behind
Unless we could stand still

It's not that we have no interest
It's not that we don't think it's worth it
Oh wait I am such an idiot
My shoulders find this hard to take it

You can tell me, tonight
If not this time
Your thoughts don't need
Don't need to be confined

I feel it too
This broken world
There is no second chance
Our flags unfold

Don't be part of the machinery
I know it's hard to be accepted
Our life is just like a dream to me
At times it's good to be rejected

So, let's just run
Even if
Only in our heads
Leave all of this behind
Unless we could stand still

On this machine still working in our heads
On this machine still working in our heads

Heaven restores you in life
You're coming with me
Through the aging, the fearing, the strife
It's the smiling on the package
It's the faces in the sand
It's the thought that moves you upwards
Embracing me with two hands
Right will take you places
Yeah, maybe to the beach
When your friends, they do come crying
Tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release

Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

Yeah, we think about the land
We smart like all peoples
Feeling real tan
I could take you places
Do you need a new man?
Wipe the pollen from the faces
Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van

Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not

You're weightless, you are exotic
You need something for which to care

Leave some shards under the belly
Lay some grease inside my hand
It's a sentimental jury
And the makings of a good plan
You've come to love me lightly
Yeah, you come to hold me tight
Is this motion everlasting
Or do shudders pass in the night?
Rosemary
Oh, heaven restores you in life

I spent a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, semi-erotic
You need someone to take you there

Why can't we just play the other game?
Why can't we just look the other way?

And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothin' mattered anymore
I looked into the sky

There are too many of us
That's plain to see
We all believe in praying
For our immortality
We've posed these questions to our children
That calls them all to stray
And live in tiny houses
Of the same mistakes we made

'Cause there are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
Passing out of somewhere
But you won't care

There are too many of us
That's plain to see
And we all believe in praying
For our own immortality
For a moment, I was dislocated
My terror on a loop elsewhere
The flashing lights part vacated
On the big screens everywhere

'Cause there are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
Just passing out of somewhere
But you won't care

There are too many of us

And brave songs disappear
To the secret voice of dawn

Destroy them, raise my hand
Reflected in savage shards
A new face, a soul reborn

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a drivin' ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?

What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely

What his story might be, yeah

Pullin' in and givin' her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezin'

Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere

[Verse 4]
I had a vision I could turn you right
A stupid mission and a lethal fight
I should've seen it when my hope was new
My heart is black and my body is blue

And I'm losing my favourite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my favourite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game

I'm losing my favourite game (Losing my favourite game)
You're losing your mind again (I tried)
I tried but you're still the same (I tried)
I'm losing my baby
You're losing a saviour and a saint

Libraries gave us power
Then work came and made us free
What price now
For a shallow piece of dignity

I wish I had a bottle
Right here in my dirty face
To wear the scars
To show from where I came

One, take control of me?
You're messing with the enemy

Messing with my mind, I wake up
Chase down an empty street
Blindly snap the broken beats
Said it's gone, with the dirty trick

There it goes again
Take me to the edge again
All I got, is a dirty trick

I can't wash you off my skin
Outside the frame is what we're leaving out

It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
Something sweet to throw away
I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live
I want a new mistake
Lose is more than hesitate
Do you believe it in your head?

Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh, oh, oh
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say ""oh""

His Honor drove southward, seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas

She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

I sat by the ocean
And drank a potion, baby, to erase you
Face down in the boulevard, yet I couldn't face you
There ain't no use in cryin'
It doesn't change anything, so, baby, what good does it do?
Your friends, they all sympathize, maybe I don't need them to

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead, I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, ""Boy, if you want love, you'll have to go and find it with someone new
Do you know who you really are, are you sure it's really you?""
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one

Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night
Into the light, left with nowhere to hide

Closer and closer, we're crashing ships in the night

12444,Lessons In Love,Level 42,"[Verse 1]
I'm not proud, I was wrong
And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

[Chorus 1]
All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

For restless eyes, egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard
Heavy hearts, token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah

Lost without love

Don't let your spirit burn

All the dreams that we were building
We never lived them
We could use it, we should use it, yeah (Lessons in love)

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay

For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

Let me love and steal
I have danced inside your eyes
How can I be real?

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?

Wrapped in sorrow, words are token
Come inside and catch my tears
You've been talking, but believe me
If it's true, you do not know
This boy loves without a reason
I'm prepared to let you go

If it's love you want from me
Then take it away
Everything's not what you see
It's over again

12425,Birds Fly,The Icicle Works,"Some things take forever
But with building bricks of trust and love
Mountains can be moved

Love come, down upon us 'til you flow like water
Burning, with the hope of insight
Feathered, look they're covered with a bright elation
Stolen, in the sight of love

We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

Birds fly, in the eye of the faithless daughter
Broken, at the bitter end
Wasted, sacrifice for a new nirvana
Night time, sends us on our way

We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

A whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream

We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

12446,Angel,Fra Lippo Lippi,"Everybody sit down and listen
Wanna tell you what you've been missing
Secrets, big big secrets

Angel came out of nowhere
And vanish without a warning
Angel, like and angel

Chorus:
And when she moves
The way she glides across the room
Just like an angel
I wish that i could see her one more time
And when she moves
The way she glides across the room
Just like an angel
I wish that i could see her one more time

She plays a game of longing
See the place some big time living
City, big big city

That everytime i come back here
And fell the smell of country air
Its heaven, my own heaven

Repeat Chorus

Instrumental

Repeat Chorus twice till fade

12449,Stitches and Burns,Fra Lippo Lippi,"[Verse 1]
People say that I'm a fool, well, I don't know
At least I found out
What it takes to be strong
I was dreaming all day long a drifting cloud
With eyes wide open, I would choose not to see

[Chorus]
Now I don't want
To see you anymore
Don't want to be the one
To play your game
Not even if you smile
Your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me
Darling, please

[Verse 2]
Say ""Good morning"" to the world, I hope you like it
Take good care of all those
Things that we have
I've been looking for a way
For to long now
Seems like everything
Must come to an end

[Chorus]
Now I don't want to see you anymore
Don't want to be the one to play your game
Not even if you smile your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me, darling, please
Now I don't want to see you anymore
Don't want to be the one to play your game
Not even if you smile your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me, darling, please

[Bridge]
Time after time
Nothing that I can do
Knowing your ways
And loving your ways
But not getting through at all
Day after day
Leaving the past behind
Coming to terms
With stitches and burns
And learning to fly again

[Chorus]
Now I don't want to see you anymore
Don't want to be the one to play your game
Not even if you smile your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me, darling, please
Now I don't want to see you anymore
Don't want to be the one to play your game
Not even if you smile your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me, darling, please

12414,The Ghost in You,The Psychedelic Furs,"[Verse 1]
A man in my shoes runs a light
And all the papers lied tonight
But falling over you
Is the news of the day
Angels fall like rain
And love, love, love, love is all of heaven away (Love, love, love)

[Chorus]
Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)
Inside you the time moves (It's coming down)
And she don't fade (To losing it in you)

[Verse 2]
A race is on, I'm on your side
And hearing you, my engines die
I'm in a mood for you
For running away
Stars come down in you
And love, love, love, you can't give it away (Love, love, love, love)

[Chorus]
Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)

Don't you go
It makes no sense
When all your talking supermen
Just take away the time
And get in the way
Ain't it just like rain?
And love, love, love, love is only heaven away (Love, love, love, love)

[Chorus]
Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)

[Chorus]
Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)

12445,Boys Do Fall In Love,Robin Gibb,"Baby said, ""You have to be a lover
One way or the other
Nobody wins without once giving in
So don't cry now
Don't cry now""

Love is just a game you play in high school
Girls know how to be cruel
Most of the time, girls are cruel to be kind
So don't cry now
Ooh, don't cry now

And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day, making love to a paper moon

And she said
""Boys do fall in love
They make time
They get love on a Saturday night""
And she said
""Hearts beat as they dance in the street to a radio
Oh, oh, oh
B-b-b-boys fall in love""

Baby knows I like to get excited
No one wants to fight it
It's getting late, so I'll just demonstrate
Don't cry now
Ooh, don't cry now

And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day, making love to a paper moon

And she said
""Boys do fall in love

12427,Head Over Heels,The Go-Go's,"[Verse 1]
Been running so long
I've nearly lost all track of time
In every direction
I couldn't see the warning signs
I must be losin' it
'Cause my mind plays tricks on me
It looked so easy
But you know, looks sometimes deceive
Been running so fast
Right from the starting line
No more connections
I don't need any more advice
One hand's just reaching out
And one's just hangin' on
It seems my weaknesses
Just keep going strong

[Chorus]
Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync

[Verse 2]
Been running so hard
When what I need is to unwind
The voice of reason
Is one I left so far behind
I've waited so long
So long to play this part
And just remembered
That I'd forgotten about my heart

[Chorus]
Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync

Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control

Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync
Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync

12421,State Of The Nation,Industry,"[Verse 1]
I see them marching off to war
They're looking so heroic
I'm told they won't be gone for long
But that's a lie and they know it
Ten thousand gone they won't return
Never to be seen again
Strategic games is all we learn in the end
But they say

[Chorus]
Don't you worry about the situation
A message from the telephone
They out there fighting for the state of the nation
I'm waiting a chance to come home
They always have to fight the alienation
And realize I'm fighting alone

[Verse 2]
When nightmares memories fades to dust
We'll get back on our feet again
This war has nothing to do with us
But somehow we're still involved in it

[Chorus]
Well, don't you worry about the situation
A message from the telephone
They out there fighting for the state of the nation
I'm waiting a chance to come home
Well, don't you worry about the situation
A message from the telephone
They always have to fight the alienation
And realize I'm fighting alone

12431,Burning Flame,Vitamin Z,"Walking out tonight in the street lights I can see you
Arm in arm with just another guy
You look at me and wave hello-how friendly
I look at you and the cars go passing by

I understand that you used to love me
Nothing much but it made you cry
So here we are making pleasant gestures
And I just can't see the reason why

Me and you we never made it far girl
Now I laugh at the promises we made
And something went the first time that I hurt you
The lights went out and the memories start to fade

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

I felt the earth fall apart and crumble
All my dreams down they fell
And would an angel show mercy to the devil
But you're under my skin and you know darn well

Walking out tonight in the street lights I can see you
Arm in arm with just another guy
You look at me and wave hello-how friendly
I look at you and the cars go passing by

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when i first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

There's no secrets kept in here
Forgive me for asking
Now wipe away your tears

And if I wish to stop it all
And if I wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking

I sat on the roof
And watched the day go by
I see the likeness in his smile and the way he stands
Makes it all worthwhile

And if I wish to stop it all
And if I wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking

It's time we should talk about it

Another day has ended
And I still can't sleep
Remembering my yesterdays
I begin to weep
If I could have it over
Live my life again

Picture in my hand
Of a boy I still resemble
But I no longer understand
And as the tears run freely
Oh, how I realise
They were the best years of my life

Bring the wheels of time to a stop

Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better

I remember when
Life was so good
I'd go back if I could

Oh, I wouldn't change a single day
Don't let the memories slip away
I wouldn't change a single day
Don't let the memories slip away

In an old familiar way
The forming of a new connection
To study or to play

Of me and you

And soft as clouds
I often kiss you when there's no one else around

And turning in and turning 'round

In every one, a red balloon

Just to prove the world was here
And here is a red balloon
I think of you, and let it go...

Keep you here, my dear sweetheart

You're giving eighty billion years of giggling
A whole new world to live in

You know it don't mean a thing to us
'Cause so much is gonna happen
Because

You showed me a sunset overflowing
But who cares where it's going
As long as you're next to me

The more you ignore me, the closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me, the closer I get
You're wasting your time

I will be in the bar with my head on the bar
I am now a central part of your mind's landscape
Whether you care or do not
Yeah, I've made up your mind

[Chorus]
The more you ignore me, the closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me, the closer I get
You're wasting your time

[Verse 2]
Beware, I bear more grudges than lonely high court judges
When you sleep, I will creep into your thoughts
Like a bad debt that you can't pay
Take the easy way and give in, yeah, and let me in

Oh, let me in
Oh, let me, let me in
It's war, it's war, it's war, it's war
It's war, war, war, war, war

12460,Russian Radio,Red Flag,"I hear a voice from ten thousand miles away
I have no choice, our love was meant to stay
With or without, it's easy for me without a doubt
As I spend my days, searching for ways
Love is on the go, so is radio

Now that we've learned to deceive you

12471,Television / So Far So Good,Rex Orange County,"[Part I: Television]

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm not afraid, I can be myself and I
Hope you can be yourself as well, 'cause I can make you feel alright
And there was so much happiness that we were still yet to find
I said that you can call me Alex, baby, welcome to my life

[Bridge]
(But don't you worry, don't you, don't worry girl)
No, I'm not sure if I'm into you
The last time that you checked, I was probably so sad and confused
(I don't know, no, I don't know what you like)
But if you're looking for something new
I know somebody that you could choose

[Chorus]
What about me?
What about me?
What about me and you together?
Something that could really last forever
What about me?
What about me?
What about me and you together?
Something that could really last forever

[Verse 2]
If all my friends wanna be in her bed
And I begin to wonder why
I guess that I'd be lying to myself
'Cause who the fuck would be dumb enough
To reject an offer? Oh, what an offer
Now two-two-ten-one-five
Couple hours can change your life
Frankie saying ""Oh, what a night!""
What a night?
What the fuck is a girlfriend? I'ma need advice
Maybe I should go outside so I could get a fucking life
I made a friend and she spent the night, and now

[Bridge]
(I'm in love and she remains in my life)
Back when we spoke in Europe
I need insurance on my emotions
I can't get hurt again
(Fuck the past, fuck them, they all made me sad)
And I had no time to prepare to face my fears
I guess that it's time that I dried these tears

[Outro]
But if I could just be happy by the end of this song
But if by the time you hear it, you are already gone
And it didn't go to plan
Then why should I continue in this life
When there's no one around to be the one who makes me smile?

[Part II: So Far So Good]

[Verse]
But so far, everything's good (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-wow, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Said, so far, everything's good (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, no, no (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
No-no, no, no-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
I want the crowd in tears when they hear this
Is that so wrong?

12468,Reflections After Jane,The Clientele,"[Verse 1]
Butterflies with gilded wings this morning
Touched the red sun and the rain
On the bridge, the workers pass in threes and fours and fives
To my sleeplessness, reflections after Jane

[Verse 2]
How I long to live inside a window
By the sighing motorway
Feel the city searching for my loneliness
In all the dust and glass, reflections after Jane

[Bridge]
And I see her all on a golden Sunday
With her hair so dark in the rain

[Verse 3]
Who is in the newspapers this month or week or year?
My silent friend
I can starve my life into a deeper sleep
Remembering reflections after Jane
"
12454,Whirlpool Heart,The Wild Swans,"These are our humble days
We had a high ideal
But the family strays

Once, I thought the world was blue
Now it's raining colors
A paralyzing hue

I am never grieving
The wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

Come to a place I know, where the air is clean
And we're both alone
Maybe, we could capture there
Some of all we lost
In that nether world

I am never grieving
The wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

Days forever dreaming the wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

I am never grieving
The wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

Days forever dreaming the wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

12451,Beauty and Madness,Fra Lippo Lippi,"[Verse 1]
Over there, just beneath the moon
There's a man with a burden to keep
Now, sleep will fall washout rags and paper bags
Homes and lives passing by

[Chorus]
Who will see the beauty in your life?
And who will be there to hear you when you call?
Who will see the madness in your life?
And who will be there to catch you if you fall?

[Verse 2]
Now dreams run wild, as lovers find their way
Through the night, not a care in the world
And over there, over the twinkling of the lights
Harbor lights, say goodnight one more time

[Chorus]
Who will see the beauty in you life?
And who will be there to hear you when you call?
Who will see the madness in your life?
And who will be there to catch you if you fall?

[Chorus]
Who will see the beauty in you life?
And who will be there to hear you when you call?
Who will see the madness in your life?
And who will be there to catch you if you fall?

12489,Edition,Rex Orange County,"[Verse 1]
Baby you braved it
I understand you had a bad day and shit
So I say something dumb as fuck
And luckily it gives you a facelift
But really I couldn't take it
Especially when the volume is raising
(Like) she came in the room
Chicane in the road
Now my mind is racing
You care too
Where to?
Three days in a row my plans fell through
Crying in a hotel room
You listen
If I could I'd be staying at the Edition
(For real?)
For real
I would meet you at a certain time
And take my time to make my decision
For real

[Chorus]
I'm only ever trying to help you (love)
It's only ev‚Äãer love (in a hotel room)
It's only ever love, baby
I'm only ever trying to help you (love)
It's only ever love, baby (in a hotel room)
It's only ever love
It's only ever trying to be loved in a hotel room

12484,Social Sites,Cosmo Pyke,"[Verse 1]
There's nothing to do
There's nothing to say
This love's sweet like tooth decay
I spent it on that godforsaken monday
I should cook brekky at home and do what my momma say
I'm sitting alone, sipping a latte
Heartache every single time I wake up
The girl got me shake up
Friend wound her waist up on me
Now I found there's nothing to say...

[Chorus]
Why, does she cry?
Cuz' these social sites
This bliss is crystallized, like dolomite
I need a place to sink, my aura stinks
And if you'd realize

[Verse 2]
I have a girl, she's the best
She used to get the train, from southwest
But when she hit Clapham, it happened that I wasn't in ends
As friends we tend to lend funds
But she knows its not just girls who want to have fun
That's why....

[Chorus]
Why, does she cry?
Cuz' these social sites
This spliff is really nice, but I need a light
I need a place to sink, my aura stinks
And if you'd realize

[Verse 3]
There's nothing to do
It was as slimy day
I lost my baby, now I'm fading away
There's nothing ruthless, I just seem to be useless
And truth gets something inside of the way
I'm sitting alone, sipping a latte
With heartache every single time I wake up
Girl got me shake
A friend round her waist
Now I found there's nothing to say...

[Chorus]
Why, does she cry?
Cuz' these social sites
This bliss is crystallized, like dolomite
I need a place to sink, my aura stinks

Yeah, you're cold, about it
Now that you know, about it
Will it show?
I don't doubt it
Antidote, I found it
Feeling low, about it
On the go, without it
Want to go home, should I shout it?
I miss my home

[Verse 2]
Now you know, that I'm not all that you thought I would be
Grateful I showed the real me
Yeah, it shows
When you look in my eyes, it breaks all my bones
"
12476,Winter's Ballad,Cuco,"[Verse]
Due to my frustration
I waited way too long to say a thing
Sure I accept that I was sad, so I guess now it's not so bad
I lost the memories deep inside my head
Show me that tonight I'm only yours and no one else's
Too blind to see sometimes that you're the one
Now I see you're everything, or just maybe my nothing
They say that nothing lasts forever
My bed was meant for two and now I'm missing only you
Or was this spot reserved for no one more?
My lonely days are here, I don't think I see you here
I wish that I could sleep until forever
I don't think it's hard just to tell me that you love me
But you're far away from here and have my heart
So shoot me with the bow that cupid's quiver has one more
The last time I might get to fall in love

I go crazy when I'm without you

[Verse 1]
What have I done today
Just sat and watched the jets fly over
A car goes by and the sun goes down we talk about the town

This city's mad in the head and sick in the soul
All the stars flew away a long time ago
Isn't that nice like Miami Vice

[Chorus]
I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you

Well your life is like an infants dream it's like everything's on TV
You see your face in the mirror could it be your place in the mirror

One day I'll go far

And lightning in my brain

So listen up you kids
And hear what I say
Don't listen to your brain
And follow your dreams

The one that feels your tears drip down to your pillow
And hears all your dreams, nightmares and inhibitions
You pretty pretty girl

With our rifles and grenades
And some help from God

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

[Verse 2]
You just can't believe
The joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave
And I was going home
Oh I flew through the sky
My convictions could not lie
For my country I would die
And I will see it soon

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

When I walked through the door
My wife she lay upon the floor
And with tears her eyes were sore
I did not know why
Then I looked into her hand
And I saw the telegram
That said that I was a brave, brave man
But that I was dead

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home

Years ago when I had a chance
I could've held your hand
But I was young and then I blew every circumstance
Yet I still think
I dream of

Dancin', dancin'
Oh, with you, with you
And maybe even share a drink or two
While I tell you the truth
That I don't even care what this is for
As long as I get to share the floor
Oh, with you, with you
With you

[Verse 2]
In my thoughts and dreams
I do a little swayin' away
Swayin' away with you
Even if I know it'll never realize
Maybe one day I'll wake up
Maybe someday it'll be true
Maybe that day I'll be
I will be

[Chorus 2]
Dancin', dancin'
Oh, with you, with you
And maybe even love you a little more
While we tango across the floor
And I don't even know when I'll see you again
I'll just keep living this dream 'till the end
Oh, with you, with you
With you

Why don't you tell him today?
Yeah, huh-huh-huh

She doesn't want him because he cares too much
But now he's gone and she's alone again
Maybe if she tried a little harder to find
The gem within his heart that was there this whole time

12475,Four Portraits,Vansire,"There's Arnold
With his back to me
Wandering down through an ill-lit street
I'm curious
And would like to entreat
Is this inspiration or self-defeat?

And from the corner, his figure fades
And should I follow or retrograde?

There's Anton
With a furrowed brow
A crooked finger and non-plussed scowl
There's symmetry
He will soon endow
Crafting tone rows with his head faced down

If I take pleasure in melodies
Have I betrayed best tendencies?

Oh Alban
We part our hair the same
Posing next to a drawer and frame
At 23 and two years of age
Your work is tasteful, your life's urbane

As for the despots who bring you down
A century later, they're still around

And so I sit by the windowsill
Feeling sad, the questions linger still
I'm trying to decide if it's fake or real

I'm all alone
In a noisy throng
Nameless and ageless, all strung along
Nobody else can name this song
Mispronunciations and words spelled wrong

At times like these, I think I'm on my own
A new self-portrait of my own

And if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along with me
Life is moving, can't you see?
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby, now there's nothing left that

[Chorus]
I can do
So don't be blue
There is another future waiting there for you

[Verse 2]
I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change but that's bullshit, they do
Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted, I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there and it's calling my name
And it's calling yours, girl, it's calling

[Chorus]
Yours too
It's calling yours too
It's calling yours too
It's calling yours too

[Outro]
It's callin' out for you
Arise and walk on through (Time rolls on)
The world beyond that door
Is callin' out for you (Time rolls on)
Arise and walk on through
It's callin' out for you (Listen to it call)
Arise and walk, come through
The world beyond that door (Listen to it call)
Is callin' out for you

12461,If I Ever Lose My Faith In You,Sting,"[Verse 1]
You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You would say I lost my sense of direction
Yes, you could say all of this and worse but

[Chorus]
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

[Verse 2]
Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You would say I lost my belief in our politicians
They all seem like game show hosts to me

[Chorus]
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

[Bridge]
I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face

[Verse 3]
I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a - a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first

[Chorus]
If I ever lose my faith in you
(If I ever lose my faith in you)
There'd be nothing left for me to do
(There'd be nothing left for me to do)
If I ever lose my faith
If I ever lose my faith
If I ever lose my faith
If I ever lose my faith
In you

12463,If You Were Here,Thompson Twins,"If you were here
I could deceive you
And if you were here
You would believe
But would you suspect
My emotion wandering, yeah
Do not want a part of this anymore

The rain water drips
Through a crack in the ceiling
And I'll have to spend
My time on repair
But just like the rain
I'll be always falling, yeah
Only to rise and fall again

If you were here
I could deceive you
And if you were here
You would believe
But would you suspect
My emotion wandering, yeah
Do not want a part of this anymore

12487,Falling for U,Peachy!,"[Verse 1]
I was hanging with you and then I realized
I didn't think it was true, I was surprised
When I found out I'd fallen for you (Da-da)
I didn't wanna believe my feelings for you
I didn't wanna believe that I could lose you
If I told you just how I felt

[Verse 2]
But I can't help it, I'm falling for you
And I can't quit it 'cause I'm stuck on you
And it might be pathetic and you might be skeptical
But I just want to be with you
Please tell me, boy, can you get a clue or come through?
'Cause I just want to be with you

[Bridge]
I'm scared
Of telling you how I feel
Maybe it's better
If I just try to conceal the truth
For me and for you

[Outro]
But I'm still stuck on you
I, I, I'm still falling for you (For you)
For you

Mm, mm-mm, mm

Secret
Secret

[Verse 1]
I've got a secret and I can't explain
All the time I've waited for this day
All along I was never in doubt
I always knew it would never get out
There are things that I cannot tell
And there are things that you know damn well
This is getting very hard for me
I guess you'd better just wait and see

[Chorus]
This is all
This is all, oh
Secret

[Verse 2]
You heard a message and the message was clear
All the time you wipe away that tear
All I want is to hold your hand
To see the sun and walk the sand
You make me sad and you make me glad
And now you see all my secret is, is love
Is love, is love
My secret is this love

Every day you're always there
You comfort me and make me feel it's worth my while
And then I look around and you're not there
And every day you say you care and I'll beware

12485,Peach Pit,Peach Pit,"[Verse 1]
Oh peach pit where'd the hours go
When your orange skin began to glow
From a hanging branch in gardens home
Not much is hidden underneath
A rocky heart for breaking teeth
And apple cores cyanide seed

[Chorus]
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you

[Verse 2]
Lift back and see the darkness hid
Swallowed up and angled in
Looking back at sweetness dim
Ripe June had leaf and shady friend
The cool air is gone again

[Chorus]
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you

Oh peach pit where'd the hours go
When your orange skin began to glow
From a hanging branch in gardens home

All this rotting fruit with you

This rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you

We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
Say you'll stay, never be severed

You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

Hold my hand, feel my love
But understand it's all just luck
No such thing as true love
It's all just luck, lucky love

[Chorus]
But that don't make love weak; it's unique
The chances that we'd meet and just speak
A million ways they get just to live
And I'm just lucky this is it
This is it

Plant your feet, take a stand
In the grand scheme, it's all just chance
No such thing as true love
It's all just luck, lucky love

12464,I Beg Your Pardon,Kon Kan,"Here we go

There once was a time and there once was a way
We had something going and to my dismay
Attention to me seemed to drift, though I don't know where

And when we're alone, seems there's nothing to say
I bring up a topic and you push it away
You say that you do, but I think it's just you don't care
Why do I feel you're using me?

Are we an item or are we just two?
I need some commitments, all I ask of you
Your lifestyle can change
Don't be 'fraid what you think's in store

I know what's on your mind, you've got lots to lose
Your shallow acquaintances, what's there to choose?
You won't get too deep even though I'm worth so much more

So think about it carefully

Smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

Do you want to hustle?
Do you want to salsa?

Do you want to hustle?
Do you want to salsa?

If that's how you want it, that's how it'll be
There's no use in trying or making you see
That love don't come easy, you don't know what it's about

To get things together won't take any pain
Don't need to see/hear from you ever again
From this day on, listen but no more
Please count me out, and you know what I'm talkin' about

Smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I know now's the time that I went to find something new
You know it's your crime that I'm out to find someone too

12450,When She Cries,Restless Heart,"[Verse 1]
The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

[Verse 2]
When all of my hopes were dyin'
Her love kept me tryin'
But she does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

[Chorus]
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fears she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

[Verse 3]
She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

[Verse 4]
I don't know how she takes it
Just once, I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her lovin' eyes

[Chorus]
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

[Chorus]
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

12499,Sick Feeling,boy pablo,"[Verse 1]
I had to catch the bus
Alarm was shaking, oh
Almost landed on the floor
So ready for you then
To leave was a mistake
What was I waiting for?

[Chorus]
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go

[Verse 2]
I used to turn you on
I used to be by your side
And now the rest is leaving me behind

[Pre-Chorus]
I miss the way you sound
I miss to be around you
Just let me have another chance

[Chorus]
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go

What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go

12467,Stuck on the puzzle,Alex Turner,"[Verse 1]
I'm not the kind of fool who's gonna sit and sing to you
About stars, girl
But last night I looked up into the dark half of the blue
And they'd gone backwards

[Pre-Chorus]
Something in your magnetism must have pissed them off
Forcing them to get an early night
I have been searching from the bottom to the top
For such a sight as the one I caught when I saw your

[Chorus]
Fingers dimming the lights
Like you're used to being told that you're trouble
And I spent all night
Stuck on the puzzle

[Verse 2]
Nobody I asked knew how he came to be the one to whom
You surrendered
Any man who wasn't led away into the other room
Stood pretending

[Pre-Chorus]
That something in your magnetism hadn't just made him drop
Whoever's hand it was that he was holding
I have been searching from the bottom to the top
For such a sight as the one I caught when I saw your

[Chorus]
Fingers dimming the lights
Like you're used to being told that you're trouble
And I spent all night
Stuck on the puzzle

[Outro]
I tried to swim to the side
But my feet got caught in the middle
And I thought I'd seen the light
But oh, no
I was just stuck on the puzzle
Stuck on the puzzle

12494,"Call It Fate, Call It Karma",The Strokes,"[Verse 1]
Close the door
Not all the way
He don't understand
We don't understand
So don't you wanna remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

[Chorus]
Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around to wait in a room
Having a hard time watching you

[Verse 2]
You got it down now, don't you?
I wanted to understand your face
So don't you wanna remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around to wait in a room
Having a hard time watchin' you (Watchin' you)

12474,Lover Is a Day,Cuco,"[Chorus]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

[Verse 1]
Straight up ahead, you'll find a sign
That says you can't get by with a lie
But if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path
And made my life harder lying 'bout the stupid shit I say
Then you wouldn't know a single thing about
How I feel about you and those really dumb things people feel
I'll take the bumpy road, it'll probably break my legs
As long as I don't show you what's ruining my head
Funny thing about you is you read me pretty well
But you haven't found me yet at the bottom of the well
Annoying you with smoke signals, asking you for help
'Cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from Hell
Me and Mr. Heart, we say the cutest things about you
How you seem unreal and we'd probably die so quick without you
Suffocated from the radiated air around us
Full of happiness we don't have, brightness gone
So dark without you, girl

[Chorus]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

[Verse 2]
Family calls me crazy and my friends say I'm degenerate
But you tell me I'm so generous and my self-worth isn't hideous
This psychedelic canvas of the person I'm becoming
Went from horror movie on TV to happy-ending-princess me
Processing the information transferred from your mind to me
At light speed like the Falcon from the original Star Wars trilogy
Feeling like a free ol' me when I was six and no worries
Would stop me from reaching the stars
A million miles away from me
Sick in the head for you and no cure has been discovered
Like a plague hitting my body except if I fall, I'm just fallin' for you
Conscious beyond knowledge, alterations are acknowledged
And the beauty you've inflicted is always in its action
Lovely day today, perfect time to open up to you
But I know that you're having fun
Wouldn't wanna mess this up for you
But I'm happy that you're happy, at least I do that much for you
Always glad you're with me
This emotion will be gone before you know

[Chorus]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy, girl
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

It's not the first time
That I've watched you
Passing by
I've tried too hard
To get back there
But, you‚Äôre not on time
Anymore

Tried to get in with you
For a second time
You said the world's closed in
But you crawled in
Back inside

[Chorus]
So please
Run away
So please
Run away

I tried to believe in fate
For a second try
It's there in the safe
Why don't you
Close the blinds
For the night

So please
Run away
So please
Run away

12465,Somebody,Depeche Mode,"[Verse 1]
I want somebody to share, share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts, know my intimate details
Someone who'll stand by my side and give me support
And in return, she'll get my support
She will listen to me when I want to speak
About the world we live in and life in general
Though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted
She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking, in fact, she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all, she will understand me

[Verse 2]
I want somebody who cares for me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things in a different light
All the things I detest I will almost like
I don't want to be tied to anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things
But when I'm asleep I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly
Though things like this make me sick
In a case like this, I'll get away with it

And loses herself in her dreaming and sleep

And the flowers that they never sent
And wasn't she easy?

She is gone, but the joke's the same

She says, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚Äútoo much‚Äù

Confidence is in the sea
And all their favorite rags are worn
And other kinds of uniform
They kid you
You're really free
And you know what you want to be

Until tomorrow
And everything you are
You'll see
In pure shiny buttons
They put you in this gear
And driveways broken
Doorbell sings in chimes
It plays 'Anything Goes'
Bells toll in rhyme

(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces)
Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

[Pre-Chorus: Simon Le Bon]
We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into crime

[Chorus 1: Simon Le Bon]
Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?

[Verse 2: Simon Le Bon & Tessa Niles]
Words, playing me d√©j√† vu
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before
Chills, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
(Can not forgive from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces)
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright
To come undone now

[Pre-Chorus: Simon Le Bon]
We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into crime

[Chorus 1: Simon Le Bon]
Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?

[Chorus 2: Simon Le Bon & Tessa Niles]
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need? (Who do you love?) Who do you love?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
(Who do you love?) Who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)

Ahh!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave, but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

[Verse 2]
Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hair's alright
Hey, babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[Chorus]
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess

[Outro]
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chi, chi-chi
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like I've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooh, your face is a mess
Ooh, ooh, so how could they know?
Ah, ah, how could they know?
Ah, ah

12544,Starman,David Bowie,"[Intro]
Hey, now now
Goodbye love

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll
""Lotta soul,"" he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
""Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie""

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
""Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie""
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
""He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie""

And you, you will be queen

[Chorus]
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

[Chorus]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we can be heroes, just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes

We are nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day

12502,Believe In Me,Lenny Kravitz,"[Verse 1]
Where's the love we had?
When did it go bad?
Or am I just insecure?
I give all I can
Baby I'm your man
Tell me what you're in this for
Remind me

[Chorus]
I can't go on
I know not what to do
My heart is worn
I feel as If I'm through
Please believe in me
'Cause what I need is for you
To believe in me

Countless sleepless nights
Never ending fights
I'm trying to make your dreams come true
I will sacrifice to find paradise
But I need to know that you're behind me

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine
Oh, my Lola

Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, ""Little boy, won't you come home with me?""

And I always want it to be that way for my Lola

Except for Lola

Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never, ever kissed a woman before

But the first time that we met
I saw your image through the crack in the door
Immediately I plotted out a plan to be yours
She's the girl girl girl girl girl
Ran away from me and to move brings me up
And relieves my stress whenever you're around
I hate everything less, don't let me see you blue
I'd lose my voice for you
And all the color schemes in this world
Don't have a thing on this girl
Cause you're-

My girl and I love you and you love me too

'Cause you're my girl (ah)

12545,Once I Had A Love,Blondie,"Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a thing of the past
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losin' my mind
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between
What I find is pleasin' and I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losin' you, it's just no good
You teasin' like you do

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're usin', please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruisin', yeah

Ridin' high
On love's true bluish lie

Ooh, oh
Ooh, ah

Once I had a love I thought was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

We don't have to know
Anyone at all
Anyone at all
Draw the blinds back slow
Sun fades in our room
Two begin to bloom
Silk skin lovers danced
With diamonds in their hands
Diamonds in their hands
We could feel like them
Rarely would we ask
Of things we used to have

[Chorus]
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that news to you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call

[Verse 2]
We don't have to go
Anywhere at all
Anywhere at all
Bless our garden's growth
Ivy climbs the wall
Heather in the fall
Smoke-screen those who stand
So righteous in our path
That never thought to ask
We'll define what's fair
Oh baby they prefer
Illusion to despair

[Chorus]
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that news to you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call

I see their heads against the windows
Breathing on the glass
Dreaming of the day that they can finally relax
If only this normality
Belonged to more than fantasy
It's too much

[Verse 3]
Well they're hoping and faking
They're curled in disdain
The flowers too tall for the table again
But it's alright, they called it faith

Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name

¬°Yaoh!
Pensando en ti
S√≠, s√≠
Ninguna herida sana sin cicatriz
As√≠ se derrumb√≥ este amor

[Verso 1]
Como cientos de dominoes en fila
Cuando alg√∫n dedo al primero derriba
Como una casa hecha con cartas alta
Hasta que una tormenta sopla su puerta de forma agresiva
Como empujar a un ni√±o de un a√±o y medio de vida sin una maldita raz√≥n
Como un paracaidista que olvid√≥ el paraca√≠das, as√≠ se derrumb√≥ este amor
Y ni siquiera porque alguno de los dos quer√≠a
Sino por no tener un buen detector de mentiras
Porque de esa manera, en mi memoria vieras
La causa del problema, tambi√©n la soluci√≥n
Quiz√°s me comprendieras, a menos que creyeras
Que no tengo defectos o soy el nuevo Dios, eoh
De nada sirve recordarte los besos de ojos cerrados
Los abrazos y sonrisas del pasado, los sue√±os trazados
Las veces que hemos llorado
Por cosas que han pasado y hemos superado
Los juegos, los secretos, los momentos contentos
Los sobrenombres tiernos
Que ser√≠an cursis de no ser por esto que sentimos
Que nos mantuvo siempre unidos
Y en sus tiempos libres hace que el mundo tenga sentido
Estoy tan confundido, no s√© si llorar
Molestarme, o sentarme a pensar, buscarte o solamente esperar
Sigo dudando que en algo sirva rezar
Y he llegado a pensar que o Dios no existe o Dios es bipolar
Y aqu√≠ estar√©, con tus fotos en mi memoria
Quiz√°s con una nueva novia, pensando en ti
El tiempo sana heridas de manera obvia
Aunque ninguna herida sana sin dejar cicatriz
Quisiera tanto tener la voz de un cantante
Para no solo recitar, sino cantarte
Pues mi √∫nica defensa es explicarte este malentendido
Dame otra oportunidad y juro querr√°s envejecer conmigo
Esto es como caminar en c√≠rculos por horas
Como ver a un gato perseguir su cola
Es algo il√≥gico estar con otra persona y preguntarnos
C√≥mo hubiese sido si te hubieses permitido amarnos
Las calles que transito, los lugares que visito
La ropa que visto, insisto, todo me hace verte aqu√≠
Ayer cre√≠ que te vi y al notar que no eras
Supe que aunque pueda, no quiero vivir sin ti

[Puente]
No te dir√© que creo que morir√© sin ti
Porque no creo, no creo, no creo, ¬°no creo!
T√∫ sabes que soy un guerrero, ouh-ouh-ouh
No te dir√© que no puedo vivir sin ti
Porque s√≠ puedo, s√≠ puedo, s√≠ puedo, ¬°s√≠ puedo!
Sencillamente es que no quiero, ouh-ouh-ouh

[Verso 2]
Y aqu√≠ estar√© esper√°ndote, d√°ndome mi puesto
Ojal√° que cuando rectifiques yo a√∫n est√© dispuesto
A olvidar el pasado y perdonar que t√∫ no me hayas perdonado
Y que no hayas notado que te amo; cu√°nto te amo
Divi√©rtete, vuela muy lejos
Que si llegamos a viejos y nos vemos
Te dir√© ""Te odio"" despu√©s de aspirar tu pelo
Y si morimos y hay un cielo, me escapar√© del infierno
Y te har√© el amor en una nube en honor a nuestros recuerdos
Mira lo cursi que me has convertido
Si esto no es amor entonces soy un loco sin motivo
Quiero seguir vivo solo para
Alg√∫n d√≠a decirte en tu cara que a√∫n te amo
Aunque a√∫n todo puede ser diferente
Si nos juntamos y cambiamos este tema por uno que diga
""Vivieron felices para siempre""

[Outro]
Eh, yaoh
¬°Vivieron felices para siempre!

12523,Bubble Gum,Clairo,"[Verse 1]
Sorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse

[Chorus]
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto Bismol veins and I grin

[Verse 2]
You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too?

[Verse 1]
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke
'Cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm (I'm)

For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?

[Verse 2]
Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walkin' around with a limp and a hunch
Sayin' stuff like, ""You only live once""
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talkin' about

[Pre-Chorus]
Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm (I'm)
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm (I'm)

[Chorus]
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my

For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me (Uh)

Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Go on, go on, just walk away
Go on, go on, your choice is made
Go on, go on, and disappear
Go on, go on away from here

And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her in between
Without you

I shivered like a child
Yesterday, away from you
It froze me deep inside

Come back, come back, don't walk away
Come back, come back, come back today
Come back, come back, why can't you see?
Come back, come back, come back to me

While we're laying by the poolside, poolside

Fading in and out of long nights, long nights
There's no limit to your love

Just as long as you'll be home

Oh oh, just take in it all

I've spent six years on your trail
Six full years of my life on your trail

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at the Y.W.C.A
I said ""I like it here, can I stay?
I like it here, can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?""

She was left behind and sour
And she wrote to me equally dour
She said ""In the days when you were hopelessly poor
I just liked you more""

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

Sixteen, clumsy and shy

Far too long chasing your tail

12561,It's The End Of The World As We Know It,R.E.M.,"[Verse 1]
That's great
It starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes
An aeroplane
Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Speed it up a notch, speak, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter with fear fight, down, height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left her and wasn't coming in a hurry with the Furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh-oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine

[Verse 2]
Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a votive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh-oh, this means
No fear, cavalier renegade steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives
And I decline

[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

The other night I drifted nice, continental drift divide
Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein

Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck
Right? Right

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine

[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

And I feel fine

12568,Saturday Night‚Äôs Alright,Elton John,"[Verse 1]
It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Guitar break]

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
'Cause Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Outro]
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright, whoo

12575,What Difference Does It Make?,The Smiths,"[Verse 1]
All men have secrets and here is mine
So let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I think I can rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front
Of a flying bullet for you

[Chorus]
So, what difference does it make?
So, what difference does it make?
It makes none, but now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight

[Verse 2]
The devil will find work
For idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
Because you asked me to
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
But I'm still fond of you
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
So, what difference does it make?
Oh, what difference does it make?
Oh, it makes none, but now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

[Verse 3]
Oh, the devil will find work
For idle hands to do
I stole, and then I lied
Just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
But no more apologies
No more, no more apologies
Oh, I'm too tired, I'm so sick and tired
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today

[Outro]
But I'm still fond of you
Oh-oh-oh
Oh, my sacred one
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

12591,50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,Paul Simon,"[Verse 1]
""The problem is all inside your head,"" she said to me
""The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover""
She said, ""It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover""
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus]
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Ooh, slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

[Verse 2]
She said, ""It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again""
I said, ""I appreciate that, and would you please explain
About the fifty ways?""
She said, ""Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light""
And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus]
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

12592,Pictures of You,The Cure,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

[Verse 3]
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

[Verse 4]
Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

[Verse 5]
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels, so much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 6]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
And always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you

12595,Sign of the Times,Harry Styles,"[Verse 1]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

[Bridge]
We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

[Outro]
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away

12593,Close To Me,The Cure,"[Verse 1]
I've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me

[Verse 2]
Just try to see in the dark, just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait until I shake

[Chorus]
But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

[Verse 1]
I've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me

But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

12551,All Things Must Pass,George Harrison,"[Verse 1]
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always gonna be this gray

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away

[Verse 2]
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always gonna be this gray

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away

[Bridge]
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So, I must be on my way and face another day

[Verse 3]
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always gonna be this gray

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away

Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knock on my door
I gave you my key

Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down

Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart

12563,Into The Great Wide Open,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,"[Verse 1]
Eddie waited 'til he finished high school
He went to Hollywood, got a tattoo
He met a girl out there with a tattoo, too
The future was wide open
They moved into a place they both could afford
He found a night club he could work at the door
She had a guitar and she taught him some chords
The sky was the limit

[Chorus]
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue

[Verse 2]
The papers said Ed always played from the heart
He got an agent and a roadie named Bart
They made a record and it went in the charts
The sky was the limit
His leather jacket had chains that would jingle
They both met movie stars, partied and mingled
Their A&R man said, ""I don't hear a single""
The future was wide open (Oh)

[Chorus]
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Into the great wide open
A rebel without a clue (Ayy)
"
12594,All Those Years Ago,George Harrison,"[Verse 1]
I'm shoutin' all about love
While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago

[Verse 2]
Talkin' all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love

[Bridge]
Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

[Verse 3]
We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago

[Instrumental Break]
All those years ago
All those years ago

[Bridge]
Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
All else that we despised

[Verse 4]
They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all, though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago

[Outro]
All those years ago
All those years ago

12569,The Bitch Is Back,Elton John,"[Verse 1]
I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back (oh)

[Verse 2]
Eat meat on Friday, that's alright
I even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh

[Verse 3]
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my God, what's that?
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back (oh)

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh

12552,Two Fine People,Yusuf / Cat Stevens,"Now that I've passed your test
How can I prove to you baby I'll never let you down?
If I led you around, I'm sorry but I never meant to worry you know

Now that I've kissed your breast
How can I prove to you baby I'll never make you sad
If I ever had, do believe your tears  won't come back again

I love you, though the stars may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you till my body changes into an old man
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain

Anything that Heaven can give you, I can give you instead

How could I lie to you baby? I'll never lead you around
I'll take care of everything you need, darling every little need will be found

I love you though the time may change and snowmen sleep in the sea
And I really only want you to want me
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain

Now that you've shown your heart
I'll be right with you baby, I'll never leave you alone
Anywhere you want me to be honey, I'll be there to have and to hold

And now that the clouds roll back, hold on to me baby
We're going never to land, flying on the power of love
Flying on the power of love

I love you, though time may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you, till the very same come back to the land
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain

Two fine people should help each other
Two fine people should love each other
Two fine people should help each other

12555,Wasteland,The Jam,"Meet me on the wastelands - later this day
We'll sit and talk and hold hands maybe
For there's not much else to do in this drab and colourless
Place
We'll sit amongst the rubber tyres
Amongst the discarded bric-a-brac
People have no use for - amongst the smouldering embers of
Yesterday

And when or if the sun shines
Lighting our once beautiful features
We'll smile but only for seconds
For to be caught smiling is to acknowledge life
A brave but useless show of compassion
And that is forbidden in this drab and colourless world

Meet me on the wastelands - the ones behind
The old houses - the ones - left standing pre-war -
The ones overshadowed by the monolith monstrosities -
Councils call homes

And there amongst the shit - the dirty linen
The holy Coca-Cola tins - the punctured footballs
The ragged dolls - the rusting bicycles
We'll sit and probably hold hands

And watch the rain fall (watch it, watch it)
Tumble and fall (tumble and falling)
Like our lives (like our lives)
Just like our lives

We'll talk about the old days
When the wasteland was release when we could play
And think - without feeling guilty -
Meet me later but we'll have to hold hands
Tumble and fall (tumble and falling)
Like our lives (like our lives)
Exactly like our lives

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?

I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes
You told me

Oh, yes you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you

So come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you

But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you

So come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you
I need you

Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please
But look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside
It‚Äôs bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand
And look around you
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

[Verse 3]
Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hope should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

[Verse 4]
Ahhh, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

[Outro]
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground

Been beat up and battered around
Been sent up, and I've been shot down
You're the best thing that I've ever found
Handle me with care

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
Reputation's changeable
Situation's tolerable
But, baby, you're adorable
Handle me with care

[Pre-Chorus: Roy Orbison]
I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care?

[Chorus: Bob Dylan and Tom Petty]
Everybody's got somebody to lean on

Sent to meetings, hypnotized
Overexposed, commercialized

12579,Out Of Tune,Real Estate,"In no solid state
You know we can't cop to
The frequency of your inner debate
It was all out of tune

You're entering this town
Yourself a weeping clown
You play along to songs written for you
But you're all out of tune

You're all out of tune

See the cars on the 95
Cut through them like a sharpened knife
Oh oh

You're all out of tune

See the cars on the 95
Cut through them like a sharpened knife
Oh oh

You've got the wrong attitude

In no solid state
You know we can't cop to
The frequency of your inner debate
It was all out of tune

You're entering this town
Yourself a weeping clown
You play along to songs written for you
But you're all out of tune

You're all out of tune

12588,Rocky Mountain High,John Denver,"[Verse 1]
He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin' home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

[Verse 2]
When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away
On the road and hangin' by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long

[Chorus]
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

[Verse 3]
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend, but kept the memory

[Verse 4]
Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

[Verse 5]
Now his life is full of wonder, but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky Mountain high

[Outro]
Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

12580,Honky Cat,Elton John,"[Verse 1]
When I look back, boy, I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind

[Chorus 1]
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

[Verse 2]
Well, I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the fools back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, ""Believe in the Lord"" is the golden rule

[Chorus 2]
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, change is gonna do me good
(Ooh, baby)
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

[Verse 3]
They said, stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city, boy, is, is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no
Ha, how can you stop when your feet say go

[Chorus 1]
You better get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

Oh yeah, get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo

12571,Awaiting On You All,George Harrison,"[Verse 1]
You don't need no love in
You don't need no bed pan
You don't need a horoscope or a microscope
To see the mess that you're in
If you open up your heart
You know what I mean
We've been polluted so long
Now here's a way for you to get clean

You don't need no passport
And you don't need no visas
You don't need to designate or to emigrate
Before you can see Jesus
If you open up your heart
You'll see He's right there
He always was and will be
He'll relieve you of your cares

[Chorus]
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
Yes, the Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
Yes, the Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see

You don't need no church house
And you don't need no Temple
You don't need no rosary beads or them books to read
To see that you have fallen
If you open up your heart
You know what I mean
We've been kept down so long
Someone's thinking that we're all green

[Outro]
While the Pope owns 51% of General Motors
And the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us
But the Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free

12559,The King of Wishful Thinking,Go West,"[Verse 1]
I don't need to fall at your feet
Just 'cause you cut me to the bone
And I won't miss
The way that you kiss me
We were never carved in stone

If I don't listen
To the talk of the town
Then maybe I can fool myself

I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking

And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
I am the king of wishful thinking

I refuse to give in to my blues
That's not how it's going to be

No
That you have made a hole in my heart
And now I've got to fool myself

I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking

Shed a tear for you

I'll pretend my ship's not sinking
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking

I know I will
You made a hole in my heart
But I won't shed a tear for you
I'll be the king of wishful thinking

I'll get over you
I'll pretend my heart's still beating
'Cause I've got no more tears for you
I'm the king of wishful thinking

I'll get over you
I know I will
You made a hole in my heart
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking

12598,Rising Sun,George Harrison,"[Verse 1]
On the street of villains taken for a ride
You can have the devil as a guide
And crippled by the boundaries, programmed into guilt
Until your nervous system starts to tilt
And in the room of mirrors you can see for miles
But everything that's there is in disguise
Every word you've uttered and every thought you've had
Is all inside your file, the good and the bad

[Chorus 1]
But in the rising sun
You can feel your life begin
Universe at play inside your DNA
And you're a billion years old today

[Chorus 2]
Oh the rising sun
And the place it's coming from
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun

[Verse 2]
On the avenue of sinners I have been employed
Working there until I was near destroyed
I was almost a statistic inside a doctor's case
When I heard the messenger from the inner space
He was sending me a signal that for so long I had ignored
But he held on to my umbilical cord
Until the ghost of memory trapped in my body, mind
Came out of hiding to become alive

[Chorus 3]
And in the rising sun
You can hear your life begin
And it's here and there, nowhere and everywhere
Though its atmosphere is rare

[Chorus 4]
Oh the rising sun
And the place that it's coming from
Is inside of me and now I feel it constantly
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 1]
But in the rising sun
You can feel your life begin
Universe at play inside your DNA
And you're a billion years old today

[Chorus 2]
Oh the rising sun
And the place it's coming from
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun

We met when we were at school
Never took no shit from no one, we weren't fools
The teacher says we're dumb, we're only havin' fun
You know we piss on everyone in the classroom

[Verse 1]
When we got thrown out I left without much fuss
And weekends we'd go dancin' down Streatham on the bus
You always made me laugh, got me in bad fights
Play me pool all night, smokin' menthols

[Verse 2]
I practiced daily in my room
You were down the Crown plannin' your next move
Go on a nickin' spree, hit the wrong guy
Each of you get three years in Brixton

I did my very best to write
How was Butlins? Were the screws too tight?
When you lot get out were gonna hit the town
We'll burn it fucking down to a cinder

[Chorus]
'Cause years have passed and things have changed
And I move anyway I want to go
And I'll never forget the feelin' I got
When I heard that you'd got home

And I'll never forget the smile on my face
'Cause I knew where you would be
And if you're in the Crown tonight have a drink on me
But go easy
Step lightly, yeah
Stay free

12577,Cemetry Gates,The Smiths,"[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

[Verse 1]
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With-a loves and hates and passions just like mine
They were born, and then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair, I want to cry

[Verse 2]
You say, ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

[Verse 3]
If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take on loan
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall

[Verse 4]
You say, ""'Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text from whence was ripped
Some dizzy whore, 1804

[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose
'Cause whale blubber Wilde is on m-mine (Sugar)

I don't want to stand between you and love, honey
Take a little time

Ah, I don't want to know

12550,Waterloo Sunset,The Kinks,"[Verse 1]
Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night?
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

[Chorus]
(Sha-la-la)
Every day I look at the world from my window
(Sha-la-la)
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine (Waterloo sunset's fine)

[Verse 2]
Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

[Chorus]
(Sha-la-la)
Every day I look at the world from my window
(Sha-la-la)
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine (Waterloo sunset's fine)

[Verse 3]
Millions of people swarming like flies 'round
Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound

[Pre-Chorus]
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

[Outro]
Waterloo sunset's fine (Waterloo sunset's fine, Waterloo sunset's fine)

12565,Wildflowers,Tom Petty,"[Chorus]
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
Sail away, kill off the hours
You belong somewhere you feel free

[Verse 1]
Run away, find you a lover
Go away somewhere all bright and new
I have seen no other
Who compares with you

[Chorus]
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
You belong with your love on your arm
You belong somewhere you feel free

[Verse 2]
Run away, go find a lover
Run away, let your heart be your guide
You deserve the deepest of cover
You belong in that home by and by

[Chorus]
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong somewhere close to me
Far away from your trouble and worry
You belong somewhere you feel free
You belong somewhere you feel free

Being there at the right time
Cheaper than a dime

12562,The Boy with the Thorn in His Side,The Smiths,"[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire
For love

[Verse 1]
How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
Still they don't believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever, they ever believe me?
Oh, ohh
Ohhm ohh

[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire
For l-l-love

[Verse 2]
How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live, how do you start?
Where do you go? Who do you need to know?

12597,Doctor My Eyes,Jackson Browne,"[Verse 1]
Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

[Chorus]
Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?

[Verse 2]
'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

[Chorus]
Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

[Chorus]
Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry?

I feel hot and cold (Can't explain)
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah (Can't explain)
I said (Can't explain)
I'm feeling good now, yeah, but (Can't explain)

The things you've said, well, maybe they're true

12554,Rio,Duran Duran,"[Verse 1]
Moving on the floor now, babe, you're a bird of paradise
Cherry ice cream smile, I suppose it's very nice
With a step to your left and a flick to the right
You catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special
And you look like you're the best

[Chorus]
Her name is Rio, and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande

[Verse 2]
I've seen you on the beach, and I've seen you on TV
Two of a billion stars, it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

Her name is Rio, and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande

Hey now, woo, look at that
Did he nearly run you down?
At the end of the drive, the lawmen arrive
You make me feel alive, alive, alive
I'll take my chance, 'cause luck is on my side or something
I know what you're thinking
I‚Äôll tell you something, I know what you're thinking

[Chorus]
Her name is Rio, and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande
Her name is Rio, she don't need to understand
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
Oh, Rio, Rio, hear them shout across the land
From mountains in the North down to the Rio Grande

12590,Wouldn't It Be Nice,The Beach Boys,"[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

[Bridge: Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson]
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true (Run, run, we-ooh)
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
But wouldn't it be nice?

Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby

12576,Town Called Malice,The Jam,"[Verse 1]
Better stop dreaming of the quiet life
'Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus
'Cos those rosey days are few
And...stop apologising for the things you've never done
'Cos time is short and life is cruel
But it's up to us to change
This town called Malice

[Verse 2]
Rows and rows of disused milk floats
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives
Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing
When tears come fast and furious
In a town called Malice
Ye-eh-eah

[Hook]
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah, oh
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah

[Verse 3]
Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

[Bridge]
A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear
It's a big decision in a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

[Instrumental Middle Eight]

[Verse 4]
The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going 'round and 'round, oh
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah (uhuhuh)
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah
In this town called Malice, uhuh-yeah
"
12589,The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,"[Verse 1]
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest, hmm

[Verse 2]
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Runnin' scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

[Chorus]
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

[Verse 3]
Asking only workman's wages
I come lookin' for a job but I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, la la la la la la la

[Verse 4]
Now the years are rolling by me
They are rockin' evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be; that's not unusual
Nor is it strange
After changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same

[Chorus]
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

[Verse 5]
And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin' home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

[Verse 6]
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving"", but the fighter still remains

[Chorus]
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

Every time she walks down the street
Another girl in the neighbourhood
Wish she was mine, she looks so good

I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

12578,Changes,David Bowie,"[Intro]
Oh yeah
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Interlude]
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
And still, they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still, they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by
Her soul slides away
But ""Don't look back in anger,"" I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
(Hoo, yeah, haha)
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

[Chorus: 2-D & (Del the Funky Homosapien)]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long

I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future

Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know

Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in
The things we find behind the door

[Bridge]
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows, the way it's gonna be

[Verse 3]
If you're leaving will you take me with you?
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home

[Bridge]
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

[Chorus 1]
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows, the way it's gonna be

[Bridge 2]
The way it's gonna be, yeah
Maybe I can see, yeah
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away (hey, hey)

[Chorus 2]
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, God only knows, the way it's gonna be

You're simpatico
And of all the lift-homes and all the mixed feelings
You're cuts above
And you don't own worries or a chest full of heartache
Yes, I know
That I'll never work out exactly how you¬≠'re thinking
But let me know when I'm needed home

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips

[Chorus]
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give in to you
Our dealer hates me, you know
He used to see her, but she sold
Him off on down the river

[Verse 2]
It's impractical
To go out and catch a death with a dress¬≠ fit for the summer
So, you don't
Instead you call me up with a head full¬≠ of filth
Yes, I know
That I'll never acquiesce anything you're thinking
But let me know when I'm needed home

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips

I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood

Him off on down the river

12630,Help Our Souls,NIHILS,"[Verse 1]
I've been stumbling around between the lines of red and blue
I was coloring thoughts for the sake of finding truth
Was following rules, counting all of my good deeds, oh
Living in fear, Hell at my feet, Heaven is out of reach

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a fire that I once laid
There's a fire but no fire brigade

[Chorus]
Help our souls tonight
We are losing, losing this fight
Help our souls tonight
Is there no one on our side

Who's gonna help our souls tonight?
No one here to
Help our souls tonight
It's on me, it's on you
To survive

[Verse 2]
And with the rising sun
I arose from ash and dust
I, I finally saw the world for what it was
The good and bad, they were part of one
No matter how hard I tried to run

It's always darkest before the dawn
Believe it cause you know it's inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Just fire
Not the fire brigade

[Chorus]
Help our souls tonight
We are losing, losing this fight
Help our souls tonight
There is no one on our side
Who's gonna help our souls tonight?
No one here to
Help our souls tonight
Trust me, trust me
We‚Äôll be alright

[Verse 3]
Oh we're burning up inside
With these questions on our minds
It's a quest for the heart
Gotta let go, restart
Looking who to blame
Who to trust in this game

The victims shall remain
As long as we deny our reign
The power that we seek
In our hands, in our feet
This song, it's a melody
A four part remedy

So don't be afraid
Cause there's nothing to fear
Don't let me hear you say
Don't let me hear who's gonna...

[Chorus]
Help our souls tonight
We are losing, losing this fight
Help our souls tonight
There is no one on our side
Who's gonna help our souls tonight?
No one here to
Help our souls tonight
Trust me, trust me
We‚Äôll be alright

12639,Better Man,Courteeners,"I'm bringing out my best impression
Of seven-year-old me in confession
It's never more appropriate than now

An‚ÄÖopen‚ÄÖbook, I'll open‚ÄÖup if you do
Nothing to hide‚ÄÖand very little to lose
It feels to me like things are on the change

I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
It's slightly disconcerting
No direction, no set plan
I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
Go on, give us a hand
Give us a hand

Another day, another gratitude list
Remembering the Amazon, November, when we kissed
Pages filled with rhymes and better times

Finding a lover and losing them to fate
Finding another, thank your lucky stars, mate
You do not know how lucky you are

I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
It's slightly disconcerting
No direction, no set plan
I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
Go on, give us a hand
Give us a hand

A helping hand
To understand
That I need to breathe
It's time to leave
This wonderland
Of wedding bands
And everyone in-between

I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
It's slightly disconcerting
No direction, no set plan
I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
Go on, give us a hand
Give us a hand

I really thought you'd be home by now
I guess I was wrong again
I used to think I could go somewhere
Turns out I'm ill-prepared

I kiss the bend of the canyon road where
I find your ghost again
You found the sky through the moonroof topless
You were so happy then

I'm right, I'm wrong
I'm everything but sure
My blazing head, my freezing heart
Your five words walk out the door

Would you run after me?
I feel I've stood here once before
Would you run after me?
Would you run or do we disappear?
Oh, disappear here
Would you run after me?
Would you run or do we disappear here?

Now you say, ""I see your face every turn I make
I find no comfort there""
I add, ""I hear your voice with every mistake
It's like you're always here""

I'm right, I'm wrong
I'm everything but sure
So we fight until dawn
When five words walk out the door

It seems the world has gone to shit again
So pack‚ÄÖyour‚ÄÖbags, we're leaving‚ÄÖsoon
I heard they're selling flights to‚ÄÖthe pink moon
You say your feet are cold, I guess we need to go
Somewhere warm on the West Coast
You look at me with that familiar face
You turn around and then you say

""I think that we should move to San Francisco
That's where the happy people go""
You say you wanna go to San Francisco

You say you wanna move to San Francisco
That's where the pretty people go
You say you wanna go to San Francisco
But I, I just don't know
I just don't know

I took advice and then I took a trip
You said you were born to run, but then I slipped
I guess I'm not the boss, oh, no one is
So don't be cynical as you purse your lips
You look at me and then you say
""This Monday feels like a Saturday""
So we lie in bed, yeah, we lie awake
And as you turn away

You say you wanna move to San Francisco
That's where the happy people go
You say you wanna go to San Francisco

12643,Alive,Daughtry,"[Verse 1]
I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone
I played on my own
But‚ÄÖI‚ÄÖsurvived
Hey, hey
I wanted‚ÄÖeverything I never had
Like the love‚ÄÖthat comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine

Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies

You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing

[Post-Chorus]
I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went out and got it
I did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you

[Chorus]
And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

12626,For Elise,Saint Motel,"[Intro]
When it's tough, when you get stuck
You're at the wall of the writer's block
You need a spark, a light in the dark
To get you out of your head and into your heart

[Verse 1]
Taking a walk on the wild side
Something in the way she moves
Candle in the wind and it's blowing everywhere we go
All these girls got something going on (Ooh woo ooh ooh ooh)
Met in the club, her name was Lola
Champagne-tasting Coca-Cola
In the hands of my love and oh, my love does her good
All us boys need something that they got

[Chorus]
This one's for Elise, Norma Jean
Pattie Boyd and Carole King
Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman
Candy Darling got it started with a song
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh) This one's for Elise
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Verse 2]
The muses of the Greeks and Romans
Steal the immortal beloved of Beethoven
They all lit a spark and you know that they got it going
Shout out to the girl over there in my chair

Whoa Elise, Norma Jean
Pattie Boyd and Carole King
Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman
Candy Darling got it started with a song

Take it off, take it in
Take off all the thoughts of what we've been
Take a look, hesitate
Take a picture you could never recreate
Write a song, make a note
For the lump that sits inside your throat
Change the locks, change the scene
Change it all, but can't change what we've been

Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head
Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head
Your Trojan's in my head

It's okay if it's gone
The thoughts that you had that it was the one
And, oh, what is left?
For all those times, is that what you get?
Oh, regardless
The walls get painted anyway
Oh, you're guarding
The gates, but it all got away

Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head
Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head

12633,Mary Don't Mind,VANT,"Remember where you came from
It fucked you up and took its toll
Were your lullabies and‚ÄÖmelodies
Always‚ÄÖmeant for someone‚ÄÖelse's symphonies?

Been dreaming kinda lucid?
Don't know‚ÄÖif you're awake?
Mary don't mind if you slip away

Been acting kinda stupid?
Wishing you were dead?
Mary don't mind if she gets to your head

You lost yourself deep in thought
Don't recognise that this is yours
Acknowledgement might set you free
But wash your hands and you'll go down in history

Been dreaming kinda lucid?
Don't know if you're awake?

Been acting kinda stupid?
Wishing you were dead?

Don't forget to breathe
When you crack a window
When you crack a window

When you hit the ceiling
Don't commit to feeling whole

You know you're never gonna give up
Never gonna hiccup
Never gonna take it slow

Baby you're a liar
Sometimes even more than you know
You have

Been dreaming kinda lucid?

You just lookin' for someone to make you move, ooh, tell me (Do I?)
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control

Put it together then it break
All the energy it take, it never stop

12624,Ace in the Hole,Saint Motel,"She's got style she's got grace
An appetite for expensive taste
They made the angels in her mold
Feels at home in a centerfold

Don't try lines and don't try jokes
She eats up men like Hall and Oates
There's no tricks that you can try
There's no gifts money can buy

Put your hands up
Before she turns and walks away
This is your one shot
Time for your ace in the hole

Put your hands up
Before she turns and walks away
This is your one shot
Time for your ace in the hole
Time for your ace in the hole

Put your quarters in the slot
Hope and pray for a jackpot
Better chances with the dice
Than take her home with you tonight

She doesn't bother finding love
There is no man that's good enough
Lucky sevens come up eights
Rabbit's feet won't help your fate

Put your hands up
Before she turns and walks away
This is your one shot
Time for your ace in the hole

Put your hands up
Before she turns and walks away
This is your one shot
Time for your ace in the hole
Time for your ace in the hole

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydreams
You were only seventeen
So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

Do-do-do, do-do-do

You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain

Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay

12611,Sleep Alone,Two Door Cinema Club,"[Verse 1]
Know my only goal is to see
When I'm only fast asleep
It takes more than strength to find
This peace of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll hold, hold, hold
Hold it close
To my heart beating with every step
Hold, hold, hold it close

[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to just to find
The deepest desires in my mind

[Verse 2]
We, we only know what we see
'Cause we're always fast asleep
Is it so hard not to believe
That we'll never know?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, hold, hold, hold
Hold me close
I've never been this far from home
Hold, hold, hold me close

[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to just to find
The deepest desires in my mind

[Bridge]
It's in my head and I have said
That I must be like him now
He sleeps alone
He sleeps alone
And one last chance to make sense
Of what has long escaped us
He sleeps alone
I sleep alone

[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I don't know
If in the morning I will be here, and if so
Let it be known
That I was worthy, I was worthy, I was worthy, I was

Light touch my hands, in a dream of Golden Skans, from now on
You can forget our future plans
Night touch my hands with the turning Golden Skans
From the night to the light, all plans are golden in your hands

[Verse 1]
Set sail from sense, bring all her young
Set sail from where we once begun
While we wait, while we wait

A hall of records, or numbers, or spaces still undone
Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young
A hall of records, or numbers, or spaces still undone
Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young

You can forget our future plans

We sailed from sense, brought all her young
We sailed from where we once begun
While we wait, while we wait

12603,Under Cover of Darkness,The Strokes,"[Verse 1]
Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary

I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years

I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again

Don't go that way

I'm feelin' rough, I'm feelin' raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

[Chorus]
Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

[Verse 2]
I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

[Chorus]
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

I said yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

12654,Retrograde,HUDSUN,"Hey, what's that what're you talking 'bout?
Wait, come back it was just an idea
Not what‚ÄÖi‚ÄÖwanted to hear
Can't‚ÄÖseem to make it feel right‚ÄÖ(x2)

Back when you dyed you old Jeans black, you'd scrub your makeup off the end the Day
Dust falls from the Curtains
Same old conversations, all so cliche
Don't remember feeling right, that was me well in my Prime
And noone ever warned me 'bout dreading in the morning after no shut eye

Hold on, don't look down
Can't move forward in my own Hometown
Lean back, find my place
Thought i was making some Ground

I can't relate, guess it's okay
Why can't i seem to make it feel right?
If i don't own all that i know, why can't i seem to make it feel right?

Hey, don't lock those Feelings away
Just let it all out
I can't relate, guess it's okay
Why can't i seem to make it feel right?

No, No, No, No

No one ever warned me
So hold on, don't look down
Can't move forward in my own Hometown
Lean back, find your place
Can't keep on falling from Grace

Yeah, 'cause we share a friend
Doesn't mean your values fit the way‚ÄÖI‚ÄÖam
Just because I‚ÄÖhave smaller hands
Doesn't mean I can't‚ÄÖdo what my male friends can

[Verse 1]
I see that you, you are taller than me
But it's not true that I'm smaller than you
The work I do runs on passion and that's
I suppose the qualification
Don't get me wrong, I respect everything that you've done but
I do feel that this isn't the other way 'round
And that I don't understand, just 'cause my playground
Wasn't surrounded by men

Yeah, 'cause we share a friend
Doesn't mean your values fit the way I am
Just because I have smaller hands
Doesn't mean I can't do what my male friends can

And you took advantage, and I didn‚Äôt want this

This ain‚Äôt worth the hassle

I‚Äôd never make, I‚Äôd never make you mine

You‚Äôve got, false memories of the truth

And the one week that I do

Then get found in unlikely places
A little presumption's all‚ÄÖyou‚ÄÖneed

Easy enough to say ""Hey man, I'm done""

Oh, honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?

And no one really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
We get discouraged by the pointlessness
And we're pretty quick to judge things pointless
There's what I want and what I need
And the latter takes a while to see
It doesn't matter how often, how old
It starts with an awkward beginning
I believe that what I've learned has worth
And what I choose to do means something

So honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?

There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

[Chorus]
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[Bridge]
You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, this laugh's on me

[Verse 3]
Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on, baby, gimme just one look

[Chorus]
You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire

[Outro]
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Let me tell you a story
'Bout the hazy good old days

[Verse 1]
A change in the game,‚ÄÖrules‚ÄÖare for kids
Wanted‚ÄÖto play but now I‚Äôm on‚ÄÖthe sideline
Watchin' everyone havin' so much fun
Never let 'em know you‚Äôre angrier than them
Ow, nobody cares about the days of old
Take a quick picture then you run home
Call my friends, no one picks up
I guess I‚Äôm going out all alone again
It‚Äôs time to grow up, but I don‚Äôt wanna calm down
Everything happens for a reason somehow
But, I know that‚Äôs not true, the meaning is just the same common purpose that I love but might not trust no more

[Bridge]
Oh, mama, how I miss those days
Watch them stream away, I wave
But they don‚Äôt wave back at me
Guess they‚Äôre just afraid, that they might get seen
Maybe afraid of what they wanna be
Some old freak like me, no

[Verse 2]
It all makes sense, prisoners of Earth
Listen to the stories from before your birth
Trainin' for the game, kiss him in the rain
Everything about it is so fuckin' insane
It‚Äôs been a long time, you never lost touch
Here comes an old witch with a poisoned apple
Bring it to me, I‚Äôll take a bite
Every last piece until I lose the light, oh

[Break]
Rock and roll, rock and roll

[Chorus]
I can only change what I can change
I can only change what I can change
Meet me at the bottom
I can only change what I can change
I can only change what I can change
Meet me at the bottom
The lost years

[Outro]
I never think about those days everyone‚Äôs talking about
They were the best, I guess
You say you like the way I dress
But that gets me beat up
And now you see
That was the story of my youth
I hope it makes sense to you
'Cause it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me

We‚Äôre paining the walls of Sin City
Broken and pretty, it's yours for the taking

12674,Bigger Life,Michael Patrick Kelly,"So they say I don't fit in
And try to knock me down
Like a treasure in a bin
Just waiting to be found
I‚Äôm waiting to be found

Take this life back in my hands
Against shadows and all doubts
And sail upon new winds

I won't worry, won't be afraid
I won't stop from going my way

I can see bigger life
With no fear in my heart
Gonna cross the great divide
Will you be by my side
When I reach for the stars
I know u-oh oh, I'll go u-oh oh
Go-o-o, oh oh oh oh oh

I can hear a voice within
I have to leave this town
Like a feather in the wind
I never hit the ground
Never hit the ground

Searching for my promised land
Against shadows and all doubts
Come and take my hand

Don't worry don't be afraid
Don't wait until it's too late
I can see bigger life
With no fear in my heart
Gonna cross the great divide
Will you be by my side
When I reach for the stars
I know u-oh oh, I'll go u-oh oh

Go-o-o, oh oh oh oh oh
I'll go u-oh oh

Go-o-o, oh oh oh oh oh

Don't worry don't be afraid
Don't wait until it's too late

Now I see bigger life
With no fear in my heart
As I cross the great divide

I can see bigger life
With no fear in my heart
As I cross the great divide
And with you by my side
I can reach for the stars
I know, I go u-oh oh

I can see bigger life
With no fear in my heart
As I cross the great divide
And with you by my side
I can reach for the stars
I know, I go u-oh oh

12690,Hollow,Barns Courtney,"[Verse 1]
Usually, it wouldn't mean shit
But you're alright
With eyes like lasers through the mist
Burning souls alive
With one shut eye untouched
By the brighter light
You could be denser than some
With 20/20 sight

[Pre-Chorus]
You could burn up like kinder flay
Could plug up to razor blades
Or you could just throw me away
Because I'm hollow
Fire flint sparks off in the dark
Tear up boys and call it art
Or you can hollow out your heart
So we can be hollow

[Chorus]
Fill me up and I'll follow
'Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow
Fill me up and I'll follow
'Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow

[Verse 2]
Good optics see through my words
On my bakelite
Crawl down and see what they heard
The underground's alive
My mind is getting kinda dumb
Hollow out the sides
Then bring the shooting squad and some
And leave my heart behind

[Pre-Chorus]
You could burn up like kinder flay
Could plug up to razor blades
Or you could just throw me away
Because I'm hollow
Fire flint sparks off in the dark
Tear up boys and call it art
Or you can hollow out your heart
So we can be hollow

Fill me up and I'll follow
'Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow
Fill me up and I'll follow
'Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow

Oh, down the mountain runs
We're the hollow ones forever
Oh, not the underground
Or the overproud forever
Hollow, hollow

Fill me up and I'll follow
'Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow
Fill me up and I'll follow
'Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow

Young Burial
Anxiety Attacks!
I just shed a tear while sitting slump

[Chorus: lil narnia, fats'e]
Wish I had a moment left to waste
Tightening my skin and prepare to brace
Open all I am for you to see
Take the things that you want to keep
Not another night on the edge
I just shed a tear while sitting slump in the car
Yeah, I'll drink another, I won't think anymore
Yeah, I'll black my lungs and watch me fall to the floor
Die all night and then feel like shit again

Yeah, the truth it always hurts when it comes to light
I saw your hand but I don't really show mine
By myself in a new place
Nothing really feels right
Tripping, now I'm tongue tied

Wish I had a moment left to waste
Tightening my skin and prepare to brace

12715,Moment Of Surrender,U2,"[Verse 1]
I tied myself with wire
To let the horses run free
Playing with the fire
Until the fire played with me, mmm

[Verse 2]
The stone was semi-precious
And we were barely conscious
Two souls too smart to be
In the realm of certainty
Even on our wedding day

[Verse 3]
We set ourselves on fire
Oh God, do not deny her
It's not if I believe in love
If love believes in me
Oh, believe in me

[Chorus]
At the moment of surrender
I folded to my knees
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

[Verse 4]
I've been in every black hole
At the altar of the dark star
My body's now a begging bowl
That's begging to get back, begging to get back
To my heart
To the rhythm of my soul
To the rhythm of my unconsciousness
To the rhythm that yearns
To be released from control

[Chorus]
I was punching in the numbers
At the ATM machine
I could see in the reflection
A face staring back at me
At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I was speeding on the subway
Through the stations of the cross
Every eye looking every other way
Counting down till the pain will stop
At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter from the poison rain

Grace, she takes the blame
She covers the shame
Removes the stain, it could be her name
Grace, it's a name for a girl
It's also a thought that changed the world
And when she walks on the street you can hear the strings
Grace finds goodness in everything

[Verse 2]
Grace, she's got the walk
Not on a ramp or on chalk
She's got the time to talk
She travels outside of karma, karma
She travels outside of karma
When she goes to work you can hear her strings
Grace finds beauty in everything

[Verse 3]
Grace, she carries a world on her hips
No champagne flute for her lips
No twirls or skips between her fingertips
She carries a pearl in perfect condition
What once was hurt, what once was friction
What left a mark no longer stings
Because Grace makes beauty out of ugly things

'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain

How you turned me inside out

I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave)
It doesn't matter how much money I get paid

So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin
If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear?
Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear?
If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere?

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town

The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day

You're begging me to go
Then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?

Will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?
And when all this gets old
Will it still feel the same?
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer
I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders
You'll need me to hold

We are young

It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say

[Chorus]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

[Verse 2]
I'm looking down, now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out, ""Heaven save me""
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say
Let me say

[Chorus]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
I'm so far down

[Bridge]
Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe
There's something left for me
So please come stay with me
'Cause I still believe
There's something left for you and me
For you and me
For you and me

[Refrain]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking

[Chorus]
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

Please come now, I think I'm falling

Oh, come on

[Verse 1]
Maybe I should care a little more about what everybody thinks
But I just don't have the time for nobody but me
The mood I'm in keeps changing like the weather
So you can keep the sun 'cause I like the nighttime better

[Chorus]
You think you're better than me?
You don't like what you see?
I think it's best we agree to disagree
I'm doing fine by myself
I never asked for your help
I think it's best we agree to disagree

[Verse 2]
I wear my heart on my sleeve like a worn-out sweater
But with a needle and some thread, I've been keeping it together
Life's too short to be worried 'bout whatever
So you keep shining in the sun, but I like the nighttime better, yeah

[Chorus]
You think you're better than me?
You don't like what you see?
I think it's best we agree to disagree
I'm doing fine by myself
I never asked for your help
I think it's best we agree to disagree

[Bridge]
You think I'm wrong (You think I'm wrong)
It doesn't make you right (It doesn't make you right)
Now there's no crossing the line
Stay on your own side

You don't like what you see?
I think it's best we agree to disagree
I'm doing fine by myself
I never asked for your help
I think it's best we agree to disagree

12735,Have In Mind,Cetu Javu,"Weak grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind

Look about the countryside
Can't perceive anything to hide
Nobody knows what's going on
Living beings, where have you gone?

Rivers from the mountainside
Become polluted, don't try to deny
Remember the times when fish were alive
And realize what you need in life

Weak grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind
Weak grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind

Doesn't matter what you feel
As long as the others make a great deal
Don't wait so long in offer assistance
And don't give up with your existence

Step by step, we thus get nearer
But our fair must be clearer
When the sun will not rise
We have lost our paradise

Weak, grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind
Weak, grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind

Look around you
Is there anything you need?
If you follow our way
You'll pass one day
Therefore before the tragedy occurs
Have in mind, and don't forget

Weak, grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind
Weak, grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind

Scream out to the world
For taking life for granted and I know
You are by my side
When I turn to hear you cry

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Am I so blind?
With my eyes turned to a different time or hour
At the end of the day
When we both run down and our hopes are heavy

Tell me what you will
'Cause I've got to know the truth inside of you
Can you hear what I say
When I hold you and you scorn the day?

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Living in oblivion

Am I so alone and full of pride?
To never speak out

Can you hear my scream?

If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out

Nothing the first time

But this could be the night

And there is a light, don't let it go out

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
She's a girl, I look back to what could have been
Her cloak and dagger, mouth tastes like medicine
She won't last the night (She won't last the night)
Spun out in the neon light
You would leave, but you need me to numb the pain
You're possessed and you slept through another day
You don't feel the same
And I don't have the strength to stay

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you

[Bridge: Matt Skiba]
(Oh) I'm goin' to the darkside with you
(Oh) I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you

12732,The Chauffeur,Duran Duran,"[Verse 1]
Out on the tar plains, the glides are moving
All looking for a new place to drive
You sit beside me, so newly charming
Sweating dew drops glisten, freshing your side

[Chorus]
And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

[Verse 2]
Way down the lane away, living for another day
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
Swim, seagull in the sky, towards that hollow western isle
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze

[Chorus]
And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

[Chorus]
And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

[Refrain]
Sing blue silver

[Bridge]
And watching lovers part, I feel you smiling
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
To tear out from your eyes with a word to stiffen brooding lies
But I'll only watch you leave me further behind

[Chorus]
And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

[Chorus]
And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
The droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

[Refrain]
Sing blue silver
Sing, sing blue silver

12705,The Man Who Sold The World,Nirvana,"[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Yeah

12726,Everyday Is Halloween,Ministry,"[Verse 1]
Well, I live with snakes and lizards
And other things that go bump in the night
'Cause to me every day is Halloween
I've given up hiding and started to fight

[Break]
I've started to fight

[Verse 2]
Well, any time, any place, anywhere that I go
All the people seem to stop and stare
They say, ""Why are you dressed like it's Halloween?
You look so absurd, you look so obscene""

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

[Verse 3]
Well, I let their teeny minds think
That they're dealing with someone who is over the brink
And I dress this way just to keep them at bay
'Cause Halloween is every day

[Break]
It's every day

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
I'm not the one that's so absurd
Why hide it? Why fight it?
Hurt feelings, best to stop feeling hurt
Denials, reprisals
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide, oh

12725,The Perfect Kiss,New Order,"[Verse 1]
I stood there beside myself
Thinking hard about the weather
Then came by a friend of mine
Suggested we go out together
Then I knew it from the start
This friend of mine would fall apart
Pretending not to see his gun
I said, ""Let's go out and have some fun""

[Chorus]
I know, you know, you believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love

[Verse 2]
I have always thought about
Staying here and going out
Tonight I should have stayed at home
Playing with my pleasure zone
He has always been so strange
I'd often thought he was deranged
Pretending not to see his gun
I said, ""Let's go out and have some fun""

[Chorus]
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love

[Verse 3]
When you are alone at night
You search yourself for all the things
That you believe are right
If you give it all away
You throw away your only chance to be here today
Then a fight breaks out on your street
You lose another broken heart in a land of meat
My friend, he took his final breath
Now I know the perfect kiss is the kiss of death

[Instrumental Outro]

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

So use it and prove it
Remove this whirling of sadness
I'm losing, I'm bluesing
But you can save me from madness

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

[Verse 2]
So save me, I'm waiting
I'm needing, hear me pleading
And soothe me, improve me
I'm grieving, I'm barely believing now, now

[Bridge 1]
When you are flying around and around the world
And I'm lying a-lonely
I know there's something sacred and free reserved
And received by me only

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

So use it and prove it
Remove this whirling of sadness
I'm losing, I'm bluesing
But you can save me from madness
Now, Now

When you are flying around and around the world
And I'm lying a-lonely
I know there's something sacred and free reserved

Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret

12712,Every Breaking Wave,U2,"[Verse 1]
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
And every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Verse 2]
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
But it's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Bridge]
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I'll go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

Friends with shadows on my wall
All night

That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

Hold on
Feelin' like I'm headed for a
Breakdown
And I don't know why

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

[Verse 2]
Me
I'm talkin' to myself in public
And dodgin' glances on the train
And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talkin' in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah, they're takin' me away

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell

But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired

But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

How I used to be
How I used to be

I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
I'm not sure if‚ÄÖI‚ÄÖshould say this,‚ÄÖfuck, I'll say it anyway
Everybody tries‚ÄÖto tell me that I'm going through a phase
I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah
I battle with depression, but the question still remains
Is this post-traumatic stressing or am I suppressing rage?
And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay
Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searching for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular monster

[Verse 2]
I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze
Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I replace
I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace
How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case?
Oh my God, I keep on stressing, every second that I waste
Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take
But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage
Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay
Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention
I need to change a couple things 'cause something is missing
And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine
Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave
I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again
Crashed my car just to feel again
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searching for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular fucking monster

Yeah
Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh
We're sick and tired of wondering
Praying to a god that you don't believe
You're searching for the truth in the lost and found
So the question I ask is, yeah, where the fuck is your god now?

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searching for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster

12719,Tenderness,General Public,"I don't know when to start or when to stop
My luck's like a button
I can't stop pushing it
My head feels light
But I'm still in the dark
Seems like without tenderness
There's something missing

Tenderness
Where is the
Tenderness?
Where is it?

I don't know where I am, but I know I don't like it
I open my mouth, and out pops something spiteful
Words are so cheap, but they can turn out expensive
Words like conviction can turn into a sentence

I held your hands
Rings but none on that finger
We danced and danced
But I was scared to go much further with it
Just half a chance
Make sure that one night you're here but
Next night you're not
It always leaves me searching for a little

Tenderness
Where is the
Tenderness?
Where is the
Tenderness?

Whistling in the graveyard
Calling up your girlfriend
Just trying to make her understand
You're squeezing the telephone like it was her hand
No question (so many questions)
She's going to catch you out, boy
It all seems so underhand
Now she's the only thing that ever made
You feel like a man, man, madman, madman

Tenderness
Where is the
Tenderness?
Tenderness
Tenderness
Where is it?

I held your hands
Rings but none on that finger

Make sure that one night you're here but
Next night you're not
It always leaves me searching for a little

Tenderness
Where is the
Tenderness?

A search that shall remain

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

[Pre-Chorus]
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

[Chorus]
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages, 'til storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

[Chorus]
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Watch this

[Verse 1]
I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time to see
If you're lost in hell, you'll find no peace
Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

[Pre-Chorus]
That's what you do best

[Chorus]
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

[Verse 2]
I know, and even if I didn't, I would lie so
Many would believe it
Stand up and resist the chains
Of all the people in belligerent sick restraint
I wasn't enough
You bled me dry, which way is up?
Oh, you're a lie and a fake
I hope the truth is not too late

That's what you do best

12766,History of Violence,Theory of a Deadman,"[Intro]
The city's on fire
The streets are a riot
Now look at this place, no one is‚ÄÖsafe
No‚ÄÖone is safe‚ÄÖfrom you

[Verse 1]
So beautiful, she knew it‚ÄÖevery single day
Got a smile that left him right around the way
Yeah, it makes you feel good, wondering why she stays
So afraid, afraid of you
She need a sedative to get her straight
You know she need a cigarette, she got the shakes
Put them sunglasses on to hide her face
Such a waste, a waste on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, why are you ashamed?
Too scared to run away
You love him anyway
Surviving just on the pain

No one is safe from you
Oh, look what you've started
It's a history of violence
Now look at your face, no one is safe
No one is safe from you

Maybe the way out is a .38
God gave her a sign, not a moment late
Tonight, she's gonna point it at his fucking face
Then bang, he's blown away

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, why are you ashamed?
Too scared to run away
You love him anyway
Surviving just on the pain
Tell me where she went wrong
She hears sadness in every song
She knows someday that she'll be gone
Until then, please, stay strong

No one is safe from you
Oh, look what you've started
It's a history of violence
Now look at your face, no one is safe
No one is safe from you

[Verse 3]
Still in shock from the blast, sure the neighbors heard it
Now or never, crossed a man and it wasn't worth it
No regrets from what the judge calls a bad decision
Now she's doing twenty years in a women's prison
Yeah, she'll never have her life, will she feel at all?
She'll never know what it's like not to feel alone
No kids that will love her unconditional
No cure for a sickness that's medicinal
She flying high in her cell, she can finally breathe
She flying high outta hell, now she finally free
Man, he fed her to the lions, that monster
He promised her diamonds for silence
It's the history of violence

The city's on fire

Now look at this place, no one is safe
No one is safe from you

But I won't quit for the people I love

Been through the fire
Been through the wire
Been stepped on

Come on out here we like to sell guns
Guess where I'm from, that's where I'm from
And God forbid you ever leave us a crumb
That's where I'm from, and that's where I'm from
A place with the best fucking film and you

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch us take the crown

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take us down
They won't forsake us now
So let 'em come
This kingdom you can't take from us
No one's gonna take us down
They won't forsake us now
So let 'em come
This kingdom you can't take from us
This kingdom you can't take from us
This kingdom you can't take from us

[Bridge]
No one's gonna take us down
They won't forsake us now
So let 'em come
So let 'em come
No one's gonna take us down
They won't forsake us now
So let 'em come
So let 'em come

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch us take the crown

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take us down
They won't forsake us now
So let 'em come
This kingdom you can't take from us
No one's gonna take us down
They won't forsake us now
So let 'em come
This kingdom you can't take from us
This kingdom you can't take from us
This kingdom you can't take from us

12792,Beyond The Wave,Of Allies,"[Verse 1]
Beyond the wave my heart is awake
With all the love that I couldn‚Äôt take
I‚Äôm trying‚ÄÖbut‚ÄÖI don‚Äôt think‚ÄÖthat I am strong enough for‚ÄÖyou

[Pre-Chorus]
I buried the light beneath the waves
Down there in the dark, I fell away

[Chorus]
Obscure the light from my heart, we‚Äôre hiding here in the dark, silent
And nothing takes away the pain
Like autumn leaves on ground we fall but don‚Äôt make a sound, silent
Our memories just fade away

[Verse 2]
Beyond the wave there‚Äôs light up ahead
It‚Äôs hard to see when the days burn away
It‚Äôs funny but I don‚Äôt think that I can make it all stop for you

[Chorus]
Obscure the light from my heart, we‚Äôre hiding here in the dark, silent
And nothing takes away the pain
Like autumn leaves on ground we fall but don‚Äôt make a sound, silent
Our memories just fade away

Obscure the light from my heart, we're hiding here in the dark, silent

Obscure the light from my heart, we‚Äôre hiding here in the dark, silent

Cold walk the Earth, love faded white

All‚ÄÖwill become, all will arise

Stay with‚ÄÖme
I hear them call the tide
Take me in
I see the last divide
Hopelessly
I leave this soul behind
And I am paralyzed

When the broken fall alive
Let the light take me too
When the waters turn to fire
Heaven, please, let me through
Far away, far away
Sorrow has left me here
Far away, far away

Fight back the flood, one breath of life
God take the Earth, forever blind
And now the sun will fade
And all we are is all we made

Apathy is feeding the machine
Carried in the heart of kings and queens

12762,Can You Hear Me,Korn,"[Verse 1]
It walks with me, it takes its time
It sinks its teeth in one at a time
It loves to feed, it loves my past
It's always taunting but somehow out of grasp

[Chorus]
Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost
And I may never come back again
And while my heart keeps holding on
I know I'll never be the same again

[Verse 2]
It talks to me, it holds my hand
It showers me with things I can't understand
It has no reason, it knows no time
It's constantly watching, so it's not left behind

Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost
And I may never come back again
And while my heart keeps holding on
I know I'll never be the same again
Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost
And I may never come back again
And while my heart keeps holding on
I know I'll never be the same again

You know I'll never be the same again (You know, you know)
You know I'll never be the same again (You know, you know)

Fate, giver of life now is all but dead and gone
Pain, left to die in blood-drenched fields or driven off

[Pre-Chorus]
Now nothing remains
A ritual tamed
What's taken away
We will never replace, no

[Chorus]
Now I'm a native son in a foreign land
And I'm just living in a world I can't understand

[Verse 2]
Time marching forward brings a slow and cruel decay
As I fight for the heritage so many died to save

[Pre-Chorus]
Now nothing remains
A ritual tamed
What's taken away
We will never replace

[Chorus]
Now I'm a native son in a foreign land
And I'm just living in a world I can't understand

Fractured and cut off from all we had
Severed all that's sacred, now we stand
Strangers left to wander this strange land

Now I'm a native son in a foreign land
And I'm just living in a world I can't understand
I look around and see that my world is gone
Still I keep trying to fit in where I don't belong

Under the black and inside the blue
A bone thick spell has washed away
It took some‚ÄÖtime‚ÄÖbut I realized
The‚ÄÖobstacle's the only way

A bone thick spell has washed away
It took some time but I realized
The obstacle's the only way

(The guinea pigs of a generation)
An experiment to be improved on
(A story for them all to tell)
A history of forced intrusion
They pricked me but I didn't bleed
They singed me just to test the smell
They cut me but I didn't feel
I was just too deep in to fail

[Chorus]
You think you know what you want
Until you're inside the nest
You got it all figured out
Until you're drowning in it
You think you know who you are
Until you're under duress
You got it all figured out
Until you're under the skin

[Verse 2]
(The guinea pigs of a generation)
Now I'm in the lion's den
(A story for them all to tell)
Now I am at the precipice
I'm the one who has to end this
I'm the one that has to win
Bred to self-induced entrapment
I'm the one who lacked the discipline

You think you know what you want
Until you're inside the nest
You got it all figured out
Until you're drowning in it
You think you know who you are
Until you're under duress

Until you're under the skin
You think you know what you want
Until you're inside the nest

12774,The Violence,Asking Alexandria,"[Verse 1]
Open up, drink it in, don't ask too many questions
Become the vessel for the shame they feed you through suggestion
There's a rumor on the breeze, secrets that bring you to your knees
We made the problem, we are the poison, whoa
Close your eyes, surrender your beliefs to them for holding
Wait patiently to hear what ever-changing lines are showing
There's a whisper in the wind, eventual storm that's rolling in
They have the answers, cure for the cancer we've become
That we've become

[Chorus]
All they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us
We'll bring on the violence, the violence

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, daily take apart what you've been building (Building)
Everything you have is to be fed into the system
There's a force out pushing fear, a deafening silence drawing near
Sit, absorb it, guess we've been toxic all along, all along

[Chorus]
All they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us
We'll bring on the violence, the violence (The violence)
To plant their seeds and divide us (The violence)
If they want the worst that's inside us (The violence)
We'll bring on the violence, the violence

[Bridge]
I'm on the edge and I'm not alone
Remember this is what you asked for
I'm on the edge and I'm not alone
Remember this is what you asked for

[Chorus]
All you wanted was violence
To plant your seeds and divide us
You want the worst that's inside us
We'll bring on the violence, the violence (The violence)
We'll fall before you divide us (The violence)
If you want the worst that's inside us (The violence)
Bring on the violence, the violence

12793,Shakin' Off The Rust,The Blue Stones,"[Verse 1]
Bang my head against the wall
Try to find my stride, but I trip and I‚ÄÖfall
Losing‚ÄÖmy attention again
Yeah,‚ÄÖI hit the bottom, but I'm‚ÄÖon the mend

I get up
Take another step, push it to the edge
I get up
Just a little more, I can see the end
I get up

[Chorus]
You think too much, it's in my head
So I'm shaking off the rust and
You got no trust, it's in my head
So I'm shaking off the rust
I think I broke just a little bit
Walked through the fire, made it back again
Lord knows I tried everything I can
Now I'm shaking off the rust

[Verse 2]
Bang my head against the wall
Try to hold a smile, but I'm sick of it all
Everyone with something to say
Better hold my tongue or I'll make my mistake

I get up
Show 'em what I do, show 'em how it's done
I get up
Never turn it down, never gonna run, I learn

12779,All I Had To Lose,Mark Morton,"[Verse 1]
We were reckless for a season now
Restless with a reason
I can't tell
I can't tell
If we‚ÄÖwere‚ÄÖvictims of the‚ÄÖvices or
Addicted to the crisis
Live through‚ÄÖhell
Live through hell

[Chorus]
And when you came up for a breath
I knew there wasn't nothing left to do but choose
And everything I lost wasn't much compared to all
I had to, I had to lose

[Verse 2]
We laid with the dead and dying
Told them all we were just trying
To be alive
To be alive
Closed our eyes and hoped that we could leave
The lives we didn't want to lead behind
Behind

[Chorus]
And when you came up for a breath
I knew there wasn't nothing left to do but choose
And everything I lost wasn't much compared to all
I had to lose

[Bridge]
Watch the colors fade away
Bleached out by the sun
Left hope for another day
Prayed it would never come

[Chorus]
And when you came up for a breath
I knew there wasn't nothing left to do but choose
And everything I lost wasn't much compared to all
I had to, I had to lose
I had to lose
I had to lose

12770,Every Second,From Ashes to New,"[Verse 1: Chris Musser]
I'm broken, I'm hoping for a reason to keep on going
Doors open and closing, everything seems like slow motion
I've chosen this moment to stop my self-erosion
I'm focused on owning, myself ‚Äì my own opponent

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Musser]
But in this moment that is falling apart, I keep thinking
Is the path I've chosen where I should start I keep sinking?

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
I'm dying every second I'm alive, every second I'm alive
I'm trying to feed the fire that's inside, feed the fire that's inside
I'm dying every second I'm alive, this life's reflection in my eyes
Reminds me the scars made me stronger

[Verse 2: Chris Musser]
I won't go quietly, won't let the past confine me
I don't know why I see what I've tried to put behind me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Musser]
But in this moment that is falling apart, I keep thinking
Is the path I chose where I should start I keep sinking?

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
I'm dying every second I'm alive, every second I'm alive
I'm trying to feed the fire that's inside, feed the fire that's inside
I'm dying every second I'm alive, this life's reflection in my eyes
Reminds me the scars made me stronger

[Verse 3: Matt Brandyberry]
Every second I'm alive I'm getting closer to my grave
I've tried my best to just survive, feels like I'm broken every day
I'm hoping that I make it, I'm open but I'm vacant
I'm closed inside this basement, time to try to fight to shake it
I'm shaking and I'm waiting, still debating on which way to go
I'm swaying and I'm fading, no escaping, still afraid to know
Inside my thoughts are racing so I'm bracing for a weighted stone
The world that's on my shoulders that I may just have to change alone

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
I'm dying every second I'm alive, every second I'm alive
I'm trying to feed the fire that's inside, feed the fire that's inside
I'm dying every second I'm alive, this life's reflection in my eyes
Reminds me the scars made me stronger

12752,Already Dead,Hollywood Undead,"[Verse 1: J-Dog]
It's the year of the snake
Friends are overrated, so let's make no mistake
I watch from‚ÄÖthe‚ÄÖdistance while you‚ÄÖpoison the lake
A trail of ash‚ÄÖthat you leave in your wake
Knock me down, but I get back up
In the rain, I feel no pain from the cuts
Too much pain, is it ever enough?
In the rain and I'm spilling my guts

[Chorus: Danny]
You wanna hate me
You wanna try and break me
But you can't kill me
'Cause I'm already dead
You can shame me
You could try and break me down
'Cause I'm already dead

[Post-Chorus: Danny]
Already dead
Already dead

[Verse 2: Danny & J-Dog]
Here I am again at the edge of a knife
Some of us are born at the end of our lives
Wake up in a sweat in the dead of the night
I must be dreaming
I can see the end of your reign
I can feel the hate filling your veins
Watch me now as I'm breaking the chains
Leaving your whole empire in flames

[Chorus: Danny & J-Dog]
You wanna hate me
You wanna try and break me
But you can't kill me
'Cause I'm already dead
You can shame me
You could try and break me down
'Cause I'm already dead
'Cause I'm already dead

[Bridge: J-Dog]
Watch me now as I'm breaking the chains
Leaving your whole empire in flames
Watch me now as I'm breaking the chains
Leaving your whole empire in flames

You wanna hate me
Try to break me

You can shame me
You could try and break me down

Dead

12756,Talking Myself In Circles,Four Year Strong,"Talk is cheap
You caught me on another losing streak
I wish you didn't have to watch‚ÄÖme‚ÄÖbleed
As I pick‚ÄÖup all the pieces that are‚ÄÖleft of me

Trying to look on the upside
But maybe I'm upside down

I tried to fill the space between us
When we were more than just a couple miles apart
Get a map, draw a line that connects you and I
And follow it to the end to start all over again

I keep repeating the same thing without any meaning
(Without any meaning)
Just hoping that it takes me back to the beginning
I just keep talking myself in circles
Talking round and round in circles

What's with the attitude
How about a little bit of gratitude
Forgive my sweet and sour point of view
'Cause I already know the truth of what you think of me

Trying to look on the bright side
Maybe I'm just burnt out

I tried to fill the space between us
When we were more than just a couple miles apart
Get a map, draw a line that connects you and I
And follow it to the end to start all over again

I keep repeating the same thing without any meaning
(Without any meaning)
Just hoping that it takes me back to the beginning
Trying to look on the bright side
Maybe I'm just burnt out

I keep repeating the same thing without any meaning
(Without any meaning)
Just hoping that it takes me back to the beginning
I just keep talking myself in circles
Talking round and round in circles
Talking round and round
Just hoping that it takes me back to the beginning

I'm begging for‚ÄÖa better way
Don't know how much‚ÄÖmore of this I can take
'Cause anger's so much easier
Than fixing everything I can't face

[Chorus]
I'm stuck inside the madness, I know you've felt this
But I know we'll make it out somehow
It's like a war from within just to let go
Killing ourselves to cope
Inside the sadness, sometimes it traps us
And we think we're better off alone
It's like a war from within just to let go
Killing ourselves to cope

I feel it every time I breathe
Another cure that doesn't work for me
Darkness and anxiety
Seem to be the only friends I see

But reality takes its place
And will I ever be enough?
Will I ever be enough for me?

But what you didn't know is I can see in the dark
I learned to adapt to the world that I see
Learned not to trust anybody but me

I'm stuck inside the madness, I know you've felt this

12784,When the Contagion Is You,Jasta,"[Verse 1]
I'm looking down at shaking hands
They belong to a different man
He's changing fast and I've‚ÄÖbeen‚ÄÖthinking
About this place‚ÄÖand all its demons
So much to‚ÄÖgain, so much to lose
Different paths that we must choose
You weren't there but I hope you know
Holding on hurts more than letting go

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes holding on hurts more than letting go
I've been there before and now I know

[Chorus]
Now after all we've seen
Through veils of apathy
We try to gain new ground
And watch our demons drown
Control slips through the cracks
I feel myself detach
Time can't heal every wound
When the contagion is you

[Verse 2]
This rotted heart inside a cage
Beating hard and bound in chains
Hatred flows through arteries
Colder blood and hardened veins
Although alike, we're not the same
No choices left but to change
I see in you what I can't become
Holding on hurts more than letting go

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes holding on hurts more than letting go
The only way to heal is to let go

[Chorus]
Now after all we've seen
Through veils of apathy
We try to gain new ground
And watch our demons drown
Control slips through the cracks
I feel myself detach
Time can't heal every wound
When the contagion is you

[Post-Chorus]
There's no cure
When the contagion is you

[Bridge]
Time, searching for the answers
Can't cut away the cancer
Heal, wounds still open
I'm here, barely fucking coping
I need to just let go
Can't look into the rearview
Hold you up any longer
If it doesn't make me stronger

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes holding on hurts more than letting go
Letting go
There's no cure when the contagion is you

[Chorus]
Now after all we've seen
Through veils of apathy
We try to gain new ground
And watch our demons drown
Control slips through the cracks
I feel myself detach
Time can't heal every wound
When the contagion is you
Now after all we've seen
Through veils of apathy
We try to gain new ground
And watch our demons drown
Control slips through the cracks
I feel myself detach
Time can't heal every wound
When the contagion is you

Every time I'm onto you
You change it up‚Äö you always do
So tell me why you gotta bring your guns?
It's Armageddon
This is always touch and go
Now we'll never even know what it's like
Left me with no place to go
Now I'm falling through space and time
(Time)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Starlight‚Äö star bright
Every night you're dimmer, have you finally fell?
You said it's alright, alright
But I've been getting ready for a bombshell

[Chorus]
'Cause you fall in and fall away
This love is in retrograde
Fall in and fall away
I kinda think you like this
Regress
Fall in and fall away
There's something in the hate we make
Fall in and fall away
I can see the darkness

[Bridge]
Is my fate silver-lined?
I always was the optimist
But I never thought of this
Stuck in this state‚Äö misaligned
Trapped inside the looking glass
Tell me when will all this pass
Oh, how I hate the silver line
Never could taste your life
Never my place and time
Left behind
Never your state of mind
Never in phase with mine

[Chorus]
'Cause you fall in and fall away
This love is in retrograde
Fall in and fall away
I kinda think you like this
Regress
Fall in and fall away
There's something in the hate we make

12791,Masochist,Polaris,"[Intro]
This is a place I know too well
Been down here a while if you can't‚ÄÖtell
And‚ÄÖI have analysed‚ÄÖand tried my best to justify
The‚ÄÖsorrow I have brought upon myself

[Chorus]
Am I addicted to the misery? Is this how I'll always be?
Grinding the salt into every wound
Am I in love with all my ailments, glutton for punishment?
You can't trust me to be there for you

[Verse 1]
I thought I had this, I thought I had this all figured out
You'd think I'd learned from all the shit I fucking screamed about
When there was sun, I couldn't see for the clouds
Still climbing the walls of this well just to dive back down
Until I reached my rock bottom
Down to the marrow, bringing up the bad blood I'd forgotten
Is it me that's making me sick?
Been burning both ends of the wick

[Chorus]
Am I addicted to the misery? Is this how I'll always be?
Grinding the salt into every wound
Am I in love with all my ailments, glutton for punishment?
You can't trust me to be there for you
I've got this cold black silhouette hanging like a marionette
Casting a shadow, a shade over me
Just a sick, sad, sorry mess, living like a masochist
Your worst impressions were right about me
Your worst impressions were right about me
Your worst impressions were right

[Bridge]
I could ask you to stay if you're feeling forgiving
I could live with the guilt if you call this living
I could try to memorise each grain of sand
As it slips through my fingers and falls from my hands
It took me longer than I'd care to admit
This life is only what I choose to make of it
And the only thing standing in between happiness and myself
Was this depression I held so close to my chest

[Chorus]
Am I addicted to the misery? Is this how I'll always be?
Grinding the salt into every wound
Am I in love with all my ailments, glutton for punishment?
You can't trust me to be there for you
I've got this cold black silhouette hanging like a marionette
Casting a shadow, a shade over me
Just a sick, sad, sorry mess, living like a masochist
Your worst impressions were right about me

[Outro]
Wasting a waning youth
Waiting for something to help me pull through
I never saw the sun through the clouds
I lost faith when the skies were falling down

You are the silence on sacred shores
You've got diamonds for teeth, my love
So take a bite of me, just once, I want to
Turn the page once again (Oh)
Take a bite

This is a given, an offering
In your favour, a sacrifice in your name
But I know you've got a taste
So just take a bite of me

So take a bite, I want to know (Oh)

So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash

You're like a phantom greeting me

Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass
But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show

Lost in the wind, without a direction
Possessed by perfection
In this land, if you're awake,‚ÄÖyou're‚ÄÖthe enemy
I run‚ÄÖaway in search of redemption
A path‚ÄÖto ascension
Like an elevator rising to the sun

I scream at the stars
But nobody's listening
Searching for the end, but
The journey's the reason for existence
It's tearing at my heart
The secret's in the distance
Hard to find the truth in the dark
When you're begging for forgiveness

[Verse 2]
Scorched by the rays, my quest is relentless
My spirit is desperate
To find comfort in the arms of her remedy
Chasing a face, that has no reflection
The lights of salvation
Disappear into the shadows of the sand

[Chorus]
I scream at the stars
But nobody's listening
Searching for the end, but
The journey's the reason for existence
It's tearing at my heart
The secret's in the distance
Hard to find the truth in the dark
When you're begging for forgiveness
I'm begging for forgiveness

Yeah! Hey!
Chase my shadow to the sun
Chase my shadow to the sun

Just to reach a funeral pyre
Where plans and schemes
And hopes and dreams lay on the fire

And so becomes the world
A clouded string of pearls
Where trumpets ring
And choirs sing of lost believers

But I feel the power inside
A force that fails to hide
From shattered dreams and lies
Is what I‚Äôve owed repaid

You can break me down the way it is
I‚Äôll find another life
Somewh–µre on the other sid–µ
You can break me down the pain it ends
I‚Äôll shine another light somewhere on the other side

Familiar are the wounds
So often licked to soon
As pages turned and lessons learned
Are all but fleeting

But then there shines a light
The beacon in the night
To guide you home to take your throne
You lost believer

But I feel the power inside
A force that fails to hide
From shattered dreams and lies

Is what I‚Äôve known betrayed

You can break me down the way it is
I‚Äôll find another life
Somewhere on the other side
You can break me down the pain it ends
I‚Äôll shine another light somewhere on the other side

12830,Empty,American Sin,"There's no such thing as good intentions

There's no such thing as strength in numbers

We just wanna savor, we just wanna save ourselves
I'll be wasting your time trying to do what's right

We don't wanna go to heaven but

If we can open up we are moving on

We have tasted comfort but we're tearing at the seams

Something's buried inside, we don't let it steal our
We don't let it steal our time

Stretched beyond our means
Never practice what we preach

I know I need the pay, right now I don't give a fuck
Because today I'm just so tired of myself

As you stand dry behind the windowpane
Don‚Äôt try to understand us, you have no clue (Clue)
So I took a bat and I broke the glass
You're exclusive but you have no class
Never been first, but we're built to last

Born to make you uncomfortable
Our hate is unconditional
Coexistence is impossible

We stood in the ruins as the fires blazed
You tried to dull our shine, but we refused

Million-dollar smile that you can't stitch up
You're the diamonds and we're the rust
Choke you with your silver spoon
We‚Äôre caustic and we‚Äôre flammable
We're feral motherfucking animals
Our fists are up, we‚Äôre unstoppable
And we've got a gift for you

12810,Renegade,The Anix,"[Verse 1]
I feel a storm is on the way, nowhere out there to escape
Feel the hunger‚ÄÖinside,‚ÄÖrenegade eyes, suicide‚ÄÖhunter
Days go by, mountains bend
Amplified I‚Äôll‚ÄÖdefend

[Chorus]
Why don‚Äôt I know why
I come up with nothing, with nothing again?
Maybe I could fly away
Float out to nowhere, to nowhere again

[Post-Chorus]
(A renegade, a renegade)
(I need to know)

[Verse 2]
You see me grasp for something real, peering through the truth prevails
You only get one try, renegade lies, cyanide thunder

[Chorus]
Why don‚Äôt I know why
I come up with nothing, with nothing again?
Maybe I could fly away
Float out to nowhere, to nowhere again

[Bridge]
Flying high we transcend
Magnify, just pretend
Days go by, mountains bend
Amplified I‚Äôll defend

Why don‚Äôt I know why
I come up with nothing, with nothing again?
Maybe I could fly away
Float out to nowhere, to nowhere again

We could fly away
We could go fly away
We could fly away (A renegade, a renegade)
We could go fly away (I need to know)

Don't let it weigh me down, just get it off my chest
I'm never one to say I'm sorry
If we don't find, what we're searching for
No one else can take this away

So bite this bullet and light up the sky, burn it all
Don't let this go to waste

If we can't live at all

12843,Outlaws & Outsiders,Cory Marks,"[Verse 1: Cory Marks]
Got a tipsy soul, I'm a rebel and rouge
And I'm always on the run
With a‚ÄÖfire‚ÄÖinside I ain't‚ÄÖever gonna die
I'm a locked and‚ÄÖloaded gun
When the matches strike and the gasoline lights
It's only just begun
One thing I learned is you can watch it all burn
But the flame ain't ever done

[Pre-Chorus: Cory Marks & Ivan Moody]
Ooh, Raise 'em up a little higher, your lighters
Outlaws and outsiders, ooh

[Chorus: Cory Marks, Ivan Moody, & Travis Tritt]
Some call me a renegade, the enemy
Throw your hands up if you feel the same
Whoa, living life at the edge
Just say what you wanna say, or walk away
I'll stand tall when there's hell to pay
Ain't no power higher
We're the outlaws and outsiders
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 2: Ivan Moody & Travis Tritt]
I was born in the dark with a fearless heart
And a taste for the other side
I was a crazy-ass kid, all the shit I did
I'm amazed that I'm still alive
They thought I'd change with a little bit of age
But you know I never will
Takes too much time to walk a straight line
I don't have time to kill

[Pre-Chorus: Cory Marks & Ivan Moody]
Ooh, Raise your fists up higher, you fighters
Outlaws and outsiders, ooh

[Chorus: Cory Marks, Ivan Moody, & Travis Tritt]
Some call me a renegade, the enemy
Throw your hands up if you feel the same

Ain't no power higher
We're the outlaws and outsiders

[Verse 1: Masato Hayakawa]
Take what you got and leave now
You're wearing out your welcome
No one here wants to see you, hear you
Think that you've won from day one
But soon the devil will come
You know just why he wants you, don't you?

[Pre-Chorus: Masato Hayakawa]
Your crooked desire left us in disarray
Misguided, divided, at the point of no return
You started a fire, you're gonna watch it burn
Try to save yourself like you always do

Every bridge we build
You think it's yours to burn it down, just burn it down
When everything is gone
You'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out
Screaming mayday

[Verse 2: Masato Hayakawa]
Act like you've only done good
Unfairly misunderstood
Play the victim, it's so you, what's new?
Lie after lie after lie
We all stopped counting the crimes
You know why we can't trust you, don't you?

Your crooked desire left us in disarray
Misguided, divided, at the point of no return

Why don't you choke on yourself
Swallow the hate or just fucking go
You set yourself, the world on fire
Rising higher and higher
But there's nowhere to run
'Cause all of the bridges burned
All you are is a fucking monster
A walking disaster
You touch it, you break it, you kill it
Just like a cureless cancer

[Chorus: Masato Hayakawa & Ryo Kinoshita]
Every bridge we build
You think it's yours to burn it down
When everything is gone
You'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out
Every bridge we build

You watch me drink away the day
With each breath I become numb
To the voices that are haunting me
You are my drug

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so alone, I'm giving up
A broken record's all I've got
To remind me of the mess you left when I was lost

[Chorus]
Out of the darkness, I will rise
Chasing my demons till I die
I will always be a victim while you're still alive (Hey)
Out of the shadows, we will fight
Run from the ashes, take my life
Back to a place that I can start to take a breath again

12832,The Leap,Our Last Night,"[Verse 1]
Frozen in time
When the world is moving at the speed of light
Trapped inside these walls, you can't rise until you fall
And start to trust your heart over your mind
A diamond turned to stone
From the fear of falling into the great unknown
You're trapped in endless nights, you've lost the will to fight
Like a lantern that's lost its glow

[Chorus]
You're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
(Paralyzed, afraid to take the leap)

[Verse 2]
These chains grow stronger with time
But they can still be broken, you're not alone in this fight
Trapped inside these shells
The best version of ourselves is waiting to escape this hell

[Chorus]
You're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap

The only way to survive this life is to take the leap
The only way to survive this life is to take the leap

Right now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach

But now I‚ÄÖwalk this path for so long
But this road has been a really long

A world full of pain
One look from your eyes
And I realize I am not the same
I can‚Äôt explain
I won't explain
The man that I am
With this blood on my hands

With every thousand tries that end with sorrow
Even when the sun doesn‚Äôt rise there is tomorrow
To believe in demise will open your eyes
You will seek you will find
That something greater than yourself
The hand that's out when you're screaming for help
To know that it's never alone
Such emptiness
Trying to find my way home

But the life of the damned

Didn't‚Ää feel me breaking underneath
Tried to pull me under
Drown me with your lie
Hid‚Ää away the darkness in the
Light‚Ää burns deeper now

We are fighting to survive (I'll never break)
From‚Ää the ashes we ignite (Don't fade away)
We live, we die
We fall, we rise

Time will hold the answer
Every‚Ää season turns
I won't stay here bleeding, suffering
Burning deeper
Sinking under now

[Chorus]
We are fighting to survive (I'll never break)
From the ashes we ignite (Don't fade away)
We live, we die, we fall, we rise

[Breakdown]
We live, we die, we fall, we rise
We rise

[Chorus]
We are fighting to survive (I'll never break)
From the ashes we ignite (Don't fade away)
We live, we die, we fall, we rise

Get‚ÄÖthe fuck out the way 'cause they can get it too
Lord as your witness, you just don't need no forgiveness

Saw myself die, and I kept on watching
Went straight to Heaven, but I kept on knocking

12871,Dislocated,The Wildhearts,"All the while the enemy was just around the corner
So alive yet dead inside, but no-one tried to warn her
The tourniquets were cut & pasted, odour free and painless
Ghosts that stank of urban myth
And this consolidated us?

Dislocated, I feel dislocated from your world
Powering on in isolation
Dislocated, I feel dislocated from your world

That life was everything that she could take
She said don‚Äôt leave me alone, oh don‚Äôt leave me alone
I tried to save her from a big mistake
But the will to go on was leaving

Don‚Äôt leave me, don‚Äôt leave me
Baby don‚Äôt leave me alone
Don‚Äôt leave me, don‚Äôt leave me
Baby don‚Äôt leave me alone
We spend a sentence in a holding pen, in isolation
This ends by my hand

Descend online like ninja fiies on scentless defecation
Offending sights for soulless eyes of the mindless and vacant
Your neo God, your geo pod, it‚Äôs barely entertainment
The victims lie in shopping isles and you survive untainted

Dislocated, I feel dislocated from your world
Powering on in isolation
Dislocated, I feel dislocated from your world

That night, when she implied that she was afraid
She said don‚Äôt leave me alone, oh don‚Äôt leave me alone
By the time we suspected it was just too late for there to be anything left for us but grieving

Don‚Äôt leave me, don‚Äôt leave me
Baby don‚Äôt leave me alone
Don‚Äôt leave me, don‚Äôt leave me
Baby don‚Äôt leave me alone
We stand, the victims of supply and demand, in isolation
This ends by my hand

12850,Big Disaster,Black Swan,"You're so full of it
I can't believe I still put up with it
Are you think I'm full of it
Maybe you're right 'cause I'm fed up with it
But I need to see the sun rise
Everyday another compromise
You need to carry your cross
Your hammer, your nails, this ship's about to sail

You think I'm crazy
But I'm not the one who's lost his mind

The hurricane you're after leads to a big disaster
Your clouds are full of rain again and again and again and again
Your life is moving faster and time is still your master
No pleasure without pain, we do it again and again and again

Let's make the most of it
One stray bullet, it could destroy it
And then I'd be over it
No if's or but's, don't feed me no bullshit
I need to see the sun ris–µ
I feel so stupid and that's no lie
I've got my own cross
My hands, my feet, my soul's not yours to keep

You think I'm crazy
But I'm not the on–µ who's lost his mind

The hurricane you're after leads to a big disaster
Your clouds are full of rain again and again and again and again
Your life is moving faster and time is still your master
No pleasure without pain, we do it again and again and again

Tell me why
What a strange kind of situation
Why oh why
Do we find ourselves in a big disaster

The hurricane you're after leads to a big disaster
Your clouds are full of rain again

The hurricane you're after leads to a big disaster
Your clouds are full of rain again and again and again and again
Your life is moving faster and time is still your master
No pleasure without pain again and again and again and again
Again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

12872,Reptile,Crashd√Øet,"[Verse 1]
A sinner inducted to fame
I walk on thin ice
Leaving blood trails
Burning, the world is in‚ÄÖflames
I‚ÄÖfollow my instinct
I‚ÄÖwill entertain

[Chorus]
I'm a reptile, I'm an‚ÄÖanimal
I dread the public mass
Their narcissistic trash
Reptile, animal
I'm non-political
Fueled by alcohol

Drifting, under the sun
I pledged my allegiance
To always have fun
Species, creatures of fame
I follow my heart
And I will entertain

I'm a reptile, I'm an animal
I dread the public mass
Their narcissistic trash
Reptile, animal
I'm non-political
Fueled by alcohol
Hoo-ah

[Verse 3]
The consequences of the way I lead my life
Leaves a feeling that is tricky to describe
It's like I'm living heaven and hell combined
The inner chaos and inner sanctum collide
And it feeds the bad circle of life
But it also makes me feel alive

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
Feeding my tormented soul
With all of your screaming
It makes me feel whole
Deadly, as far as I thrive
With all of my demons
I'm here to survive

I'm a reptile, animal
I dread the public mass
Their narcissistic trash
Reptile, (Motherfucking) animal
I'm non-political (Non-political)
Fueled by alcohol (Fueled by alcohol)

Feeling like it's time to fly
Through this chaos to the other side

Are you running for cover

Is it hard to remember
Keep hiding in places
You didn't think I know about

Nor sets me free
No one will save the lives

So, baby hold me
Baby won't you save me
I will be down and helpless
Like am gonna breathe with no air
This contribution
Starts a revolution
Still Iam down and helpless
Like I am gonna breath with no air

Here we go, through the shadows
Of a would so cold
Darkness will join us
When we lay, down on the ground
The past is behind us
We lost the control
Keep moving forward

Nor sets me free
No one will save the lives

No one gets out alive

No one will save your life

Makes you wanna sing the blues

We're all searching
Gotta find the real truth
People, people may I ask you?

Where have all the cowboys gone?
That made the west so strong
They're on the trails, long long gone
Singin' the cowboy

Watch out, here it comes
We all want a free ride
Ain't no free and
It ain't no ride
High tide, low tide
Feel as though we're king high
We got pain, but we got pride

Big Gun Small Gun Gotta Us All On The Run
Go Down Low And Have Fun
While Your Searching Find Us A Hero
God Only Knows We Could All Use One

They're on the trails, long long gone
Singin' the cowboy

Tryna come back to what I know
If I ain't repress it too long
Send packets to whence I came
In this dump, just know to ping back home
Different paths to memories
Ain't seen this house for centuries
I live with colliding energies
Try to keep it submerged, keep it submerged

SD cards of young niggas wiped clean, roam free
Among the exports, familiar but it's beyond me
Throbbers surround, it's advised to keep it lowkey
If you see a brother, act like he isn't your homie
I seen sparks flying‚Äîto whom? Couldn't say more, son
Roamin' this junkyard, I'm one with the toxins
Circle never consisted of any humane persons
But catastrophic failure with bloomin' flower and no Sun
Idols mythical in the modern days
One thing 'bout my kind, we kinda used to being runaways
Paint the floor with us, redecoratin' for the holidays
Part of a bad batch, separated into commonplace
You're lucky if you see the Sun today
Homogenous mixes, so delicious when you counteract
Power override, left eye, effective cataract
Power override, left eye, effective cataract

Try to keep it submerged, keep it submerged

Older niggas don't really require handouts
Formatted or unformatted, I figure that's how
Draw a line from my people to others, they be otherin'
Categorize me as subhuman, a Hollowman
All I know is the drive name that they gave me
Kero's a name I haven't heard for feels like ages
SD-001 at your service
For as long as ability maintains me at surface
Give in to temptation to turn over the wheel
You know you wanna, man, know you lovin' the thrill
'Nother kill, kill, kill, these your brethren still?
Just keep it real, real, real as guts that spilt
Welcome to your new life (Watch me take control), visor update, new sight (Watch-Watch me take control)
So much for the stuff that you said that you would do right (Watch me take control, watch-watch me take con-watch me take‚Äî)
Could never convince them to get you back at this rate (Watch me take control, watch me take con-watch me-watch me)
And you'll sound crazy if you explain, so good try (Wat-Wat-Wat-trol)

Rocking to my own beat

Rocking to m the back streets
Running from the back streets

To find another path and hear my inner

Step into the realm of madness if you dare, my dear

We learn to live when we give in
To the silent waves that crash inside
In the dying light
We can begin to live again
When we wake up to eternal life

[Outro]
(When we wake up to eternal life)
(When we wake up to eternal life)

12888,Can't Stop Rock & Roll,The New Roses,"Drivin' a clunker, livin' in a one room shack
Your back against the wall in debt‚ÄÖup‚ÄÖto your neck

You‚ÄÖwork hard at the hardware store
But‚ÄÖyou still know for sure that you‚Äòre made for more
Someday‚Åüyour‚Åüname‚Åüwill be cleared‚Åüof shame
The difference‚Åüis fame between the sinner and the saint

I won't give up
No I won't stop

It's a long way, it's a long way
Rome wasn't built in a single day
Roll up your sleeves, you got nothin' to lose
It's a long way, it's a long way
But you all, you're gonna scream my name someday
Yes I know, I got what it takes to go a long way

Traded my old life for a pocket full of songs
I throw my racked guitar in the back of my car
Drive on till the mornin' comes

Ride across the nation
To be a part of this big Rock and Roll sensation

It's a long way, it's a long way
Rome wasn't built on a single day
Roll up your sleeves, you got nothin' to lose
It's a long way, it's a long way
But you all, you're gonna scream my name someday
Yes I know, I got what it takes to go a long way

I won't give up
You know baby, I just can't stop

It's a long way, it's a long way
Rome wasn't built on a single day
Roll up your sleeves, you got nothin' to lose
It's a long way, it's a long way

But you all, you're gonna scream my name someday
Yes I know, I got what it takes to go a long way

12852,True Believer,Santa Cruz,"I'm done with your bullshit
You know I don't need it
It's bringing me down
I'm over it now
You better believe it

I knew I would get here
I knew I could do this
This is my time
I'm leaving behind
Anything useless

You don't have control of me

You're not a true believer

Got no time to waste on you
I have nothing left to prove
You won't get a thing from me
You're not a true believ–µr

I hope that you hate me
I hop–µ it was worth it
To string me along, lie to my face
I didn't deserve it

I won't be broken
I'm a survivor
I won't pretend that we are friends
I'm not a liar

You don't have control of me
You're not a true believer
I don't care bout what you say
You're not a true believer

Got no time to waste on you
I have nothing left to prove
You won't get a thing from me

I know you better than you think I do
You coulda stuck with me
But I guess a girl's gotta do what she has to
Every now and then, my name passes your lips
Your late night stroll down a memory lane
On your, your finger tips

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you miss me so much?

[Chorus]
Feeling like I hypnotised you
Feel a burning deep inside you
The only thing that satisfies
You miss me so much
And now you're burning with that old flame
Yearning for my old game
You tremble when you hear my name
You miss me so much
Well, that's too bad

[Verse 2]
And we go together like a hand and gun
Squeeze off a couple rounds
Put me away 'til next time you wanna hurt someone
Every now and then, you like to empty your clip, no no
Then I go right under your belt on your hip

Do you miss me so much?

Feeling like I hypnotised you
Feel a burning deep inside you

Back in the days of no surrender
Wishing things would only get better
But they never do
I'm always leaving but I'll never leave
I'm always going but I'll never go
I'm always thinking but I'll never know
I'm always running but I'm moving slow

Whatever you did you should always have done
Wherever you went you should never have gone

Making out under stormy weather?
Wishing it would last forever
But it never does
You're always laughing but you never smile
You're always crying but you never cry
Got all the answers but you're wondering why
Can't win for losing but you gotta try

Whatever you did you should always have done

I stand beside‚ÄÖthe‚ÄÖbed and I‚ÄÖfall in love with what I‚ÄÖsee
Then the night before comes flooding back and it's all askew
I'm so careless when it comes to you

I'm so careless

I'm decadent, that libertine, I'll put him on the shelf
Just to live and hope that one day I'll wake up and see myself
It's tragic how I twist and turn, I keep it out of view
I'm so careless when it comes to you

I break down

See that picture on the wall?
Of me and Mr. Grey
It's time I face my fears, my dear
Before you walk away

I'm so careless
I'm so careless

Suddenly, I'm wide awake, I'm still in bed with you
Was it just a nightmare or some tangent of the truth?
It's tragic how I twist and turn, I keep it out of view
I'm so careless when it comes to you

I break down

See that picture on the wall?
Of me and Mr. Grey
It's time I face my fears, my dear
Before you walk away

Just walk away
Please stay

Sniffing around your door

12947,I Don't Believe In Love,Queensr√øche,"[Verse 1]
I awoke on impact
Under surveillance from the camera eye
Searching high and low
The criminal mind, found at the scene of the crime
Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it
She said she loved me, I guess I never knew
But do we ever, ever really know?
She said she'd meet me on the other side
But I knew right then I'd never find her

[Chorus 1]
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

[Verse 2]
No more nightmares, I've seen them all
From the day I was born, they've haunted my every move
Every open hand's there to push and shove
No time for love, it doesn't matter
She made a difference, I guess she had a way
Of making every night seem bright as day
Now I walk in shadows, never see the light
She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye

[Chorus 2]
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I need to forget her face, I see it still
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No chance for contact
There's no raison d'etre
My only hope is one day I'll forget
The pain of knowing what can never be
With or without love, it's all the same to me

I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel, feel
Pain that you feel, feel

Or is it fantasy?
Heaven is in the palm of my hand
And it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do
With a childhood tragedy?

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

Sometimes, it's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems
When you're face to face with me
Like a dagger, you stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep would you shelter me
In your warm and darkened grave?

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever

If there's a problem
I can be a soldier
Bring the hurricane right to your door

Everybody's talkin'
Talkin' 'bout their problems
Problems showin' up at the door
Are you gonna' stop 'em?
Leave 'em at the bottom
Some are rottin' to the core

I wanna kiss the night away
I wanna sleep all through the day
Forget all my problems
Life is a hard one
Tattooed on my face
It's my warpaint

[Verse 2]
It's a hard one
Fightin' with my regrets
How am I gettin' outta this place?
I wanna have fun
Blowin' out your ear drums
Keep it rockin' state to state

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now it's gettin' harder
Lead 'em, never follow
I'm better off with no one to blame
This is what I wanted
Finish what I started
Some things, they don't ever change

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss the night away
I wanna sleep all through the day
Forget all my problems
Life is a hard one
Tattooed on my face
It's my warpaint

[Bridge]
Yeah
I'm feelin' deep inside
Gotta look in my eyes
'Cause it occupies my soul
The things that I need
Aren't the things you can see
I believe in the unknown

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I watch the sun come down
And my thoughts get loud
I've opened up the gates
Let all my feelings out
Maybe I'll scream and shout
Let all my feelings out
Maybe I'll scream and shout
Maybe I'll scream and shout
Maybe I'll scream

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss the night away
I wanna sleep all through the day
Forget all my problems
Life is a hard one
Tattooed on my face
I wanna kiss the night away (It's my warpaint)
I wanna sleep all through the day (It's my warpaint)
Forget all my problems
Life is a hard one
Tattooed on my face
It's my warpaint
It's my warpaint

And now it seems all those dreams have come true, but they're passing me by

I end up in the same old place

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky
I'll take a wish and a prayer cross my fingers cause I always get by
Some fast talkin' jerk for a dollar wiped the smile off my face
I'm drivin' all night
Just to keep the rat in the race

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

Sometimes I feel so old
Got my lights burnin' bright
But I'm lookin' pretty sold
Sometimes I feel so cold

They call the emerald land
And I remember my home town

We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're goin' back

Before the soldiers came
Now armoured cars and barricades
Remind us of our shame

We are drowning in a sea of blood
The victims you have seen
Never more to sing again

We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling

Those are the days I will remember
Those are the days I most recall
We count the cost of those we lost
And pray it's not in vain
The bitter tears of all those years
I hope we live to see those days again

Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear us sing again

So sad now that he's gone
They tell me I'll forget

Back to the wild frontier
We're goin' back

With a darkness underneath
And there's something empty now
In the way that you live
Is there something you're hiding?
Oh darling, I'm afraid to ask

Stare out the window on the street
Watch strangers come round the corner
Hoping it was you I'd see
I pretend not to notice
The distance in your eyes
But when you pull me in closer
Smell cigarette smoke and lies

Lie awaken 'cause you're worried in the dead of the night
Why are you staring at the ceiling till the morning light?
Is your heart pounding with a secret that you can't keep?

12907,Burning Star,D-A-D,"[Verse 1]
No one gave you the tools to make a real life
And they delivered most of the parts, but you couldn't get it right
And if your mind is blind to the walls you made in the past
And if the boredom of trivial roads has led to a crash

[Chorus]
Somewhere up above the clouds, among a million prayers
Flies a little hope of mine, if someone out there cares
But back on Earth, I see it here, it shines its endless light
And all I got is empty space, a burning star, a burning star of light

[Verse 2]
And there are dreams on Earth, you need three lives to fulfill
And there are lives you live ‚Äôtil the end by standing still
And we've got too many lives at either end of the night
And we've got plenty of lives cut short by what we carry inside

Somewhere up above the clouds, among a million prayers

12906,Vultures,Bokassa,"On the road down from Mexico
Ain¬¥t got a place, got a place to go
Sold my soul for a package deal
Hundred more miles to the Goldenseal

But the first step is always the hardest, and the second one is always the first
And the thrill of success is the purest

Shoot to kill

On the road down to Tennessee
Ain't got a place, got a place for me
Grew up dreaming of Virginia Reel
Now we dance to the sound of their stainless steel

But the first step is always the hardest, and the second one is always the first, and the thrill of success is the purest, but the eyes that behold you are cursed

And you can‚Äôt quite make it, but you¬¥re not about to fake it, don't you know you're left on your one

Shoot to kill

But the first step is always the hardest, and the second one is always the first, and the thrill of success is the purest, but the eyes that behold you are cursed

And you can‚Äôt quite make it, but you¬¥re not about to fake it, don't you know

If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man

Double up or quit, double stake or split

I get the same old dreams, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

[Pre-Chorus]
These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in

[Chorus]
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Oh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Since you been gone

[Verse 2]
So in the night, I stand, beneath the back street light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon
The night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

[Chorus]
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh
Since you been gone

If you will come back, baby you know
You'll never do wrong

You cast the spell so break it

Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the Moon
Hey yeah, bark at the Moon

In empty burning hell, unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong, so wrong
Ooh, yeah, baby

Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

12988,Paranoia,Hostile Array,"Fan the flame, there's no silver lining to this cloud, it's like every bitter pill you're fed leaves you foaming at the mouth

You drown out every voice that's not your own, because everything you hear makes your blood run cold

Paranoid people in the places you pray
Paranoid in the worst kind of way
Paranoid people by the light of a screen
Turn a blind eye and stay on the edge of your seat

Your brother, the other side to a story you don't know
Clutch your pearls, hold on tight, feed the hate that grows and grows
Condemn them, in spite of your faith. Condemn me, in spite of the blood that runs through our veins

Paranoid people in the places you pray
Paranoid in the worst kind of way
Paranoid people by the light of a screen
Turn a blind eye and stay on the edge of your seat

You hang on every word that makes your stomach churn, but there's no way to build a bridge when you'd rather watch it burn

Fan the flame, set me ablaze, fuel the fire with every word you say
Fan the flame, set me ablaze, I'm sick of choking on your every phrase

Paranoid people and the prices we pay
Paranoid in the worst kind of way
Paranoid people by the light of a screen
Turn a blind eye and stay on the edge of your seat

Fan the flame, set me ablaze, I'm sick of choking on your every phrase

12987,You,Zero Theorem,"Death falls out from the sky
And you don't even notice
Hollow and sunken eyes
You never hear the locusts

Wars wage another day
But you forsake the reason
Right now no one is safe
While there's still life to feast on

You turn your head to forget
Your days are running out

If it happened to you
It could happen to you
If you were the abused
Would you feel the same way too?

If it happened to you
It could happen to you
If you were in their sho–µs
Would you be the same way too?

Wash out anoth–µr life
While you savor the taking
You're almost out of time
You're reckless and you're breaking

Screams call out from all sides
But you don't ever listen
You'd rather lose your sight
Then see all the attrition

You turn your head to forget
Your days are running out

If it happened to you
It could happen to you
If you were the abused
Would you feel the same way too?

If it happened to you
It could happen to you
If you were in their shoes
Would you be the same way too?

You
You turn your head to forget
You look the other way
You push away your regret
For another day
Cause you're in over your head
You know you can't be saved
No, you can't be saved

If it happened to you
It could happen to you
If you were the abused
Would you feel the same way too?

If it happened to you
It could happen to you
If you were in their shoes
Would you be the same way too?

Don't you take it lying down, no, no

That, baby, your love has turned away

[Chorus]
In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You're still by me
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You're still by me
Just the way it used to be

(Uh!)
In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You'll always be
In my heart and

12961,Don't Treat Me Bad,Firehouse,"I never thought you'd hurt me, I guess you live and learn
That when you're playin' with fire, you're bound to get burned
Oh, I've been mistreated, I've been used before
I get kicked in the face, still I come back for more

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces, start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl, I can't take any more

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you've ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad

I gave it everything, but you threw it all away
I can't take any more of these games that you play
I've been through heartache and I've been through pain
And it's hard to believe you still treat me this way

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces, start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl, I can't take any more

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you've ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby, don't treat me bad
Whoa, don't treat me bad

'Cause, girl, I can't take any more, oh, yeah

Now listen to me
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you've ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby

Now listen to me
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you've ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby, don't treat me bad
Don't treat me bad

Oh, yeah, don't treat me bad
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't treat me bad

Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day

When evening comes I am alive
I love to prowl around in the streets
It's the moonlight that controls my mind
Now I've got the power to speak, yeah

(Awake from dusk to dawn)
Watching the city lights
(Stars are shining down)
They'll be shining down on you and I
(And when the morning comes)
And I'll hold you till the morning light

Everybody sing it now
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right

Driving down the boulevard all alone
The neon signs are calling your name
Find me in the corner having the time of my life
You'd think you'd wanna do the same

(Awake from dusk to dawn)
Watching the city lights
(Stars are shining down)
They'll be shining down on you and I
(And when the morning comes)
And I'll hold you till the morning light

Everybody sing it now
Up all night, sleep all day

Come on, come on
Up all night
Ah, maybe we can just stay up
Twenty four hours a day

12950,Fallen Angel,Poison,"[Verse 1]
She stepped off the bus
Out into the city streets
Just a small town girl with her whole life packed
In a suitcase by her feet
But somehow the lights didn't shine as bright
As they did on her mama's TV screen
And the work seemed harder, days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know, you gotta stick to your guns
When it all comes down
'Cause sometimes you can't choose
It's like heads they win, tails you're gonna lose

[Chorus]
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

[Verse 2]
Now she found herself in the fast lane
Livin' day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And watched her family slip away
And just like a lost soul caught up in the Hollywood scene
All the parties and the limousines
Such a good actress hiding all her pain
Trading her memories for fortune and fame

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a step away
From the edge of a fall
Caught between Heaven and Hell
Where's the girl I knew a year ago?

[Chorus]
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

[Bridge]
Too much, too soon
Or just a little too late
'Cause when her ship came in
She wasn't there, it just wouldn't wait

[Chorus]
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

[Outro]
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

12966,Cryin',Vixen,"One look and I saw what I wanted to see
You know that you wrapped my heart around your finger so easily, yeah
With your centerfold body going through the moves
Why did I keep wasting the truth for you, tonight

I won't be cryin', cryin'
When I think about you, 'cos I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin', 'cos those days are gone, gone

Someone twisted you, so you gave it to me, yeah you gave it to me good
You're a nightmare everywhere, disguised as a dream
Well I got lost, wandering through the darkness in your maze of lies
You charmed your way right into my insides, but tonight

I won't be cryin', cryin'
When I think about you, 'cos I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin'

The tears have fallen to the floor
But you won't catch me cryin' anymore

12963,Breaking the Chains,Dokken,"[Verse 1]
Sit there thinking
In your room
You feel the pressure
You're going crazy too
The walls around you
Closing in
You need a change

Claustrophobic
Feeling scared
You need somebody
But no one seems to care
A one way ticket
A change of pace
You've had enough
Can't take no more

[Chorus 1]
Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains

[Verse 2]
Got this letter
Came today
From my baby
Who left me yesterday
Said she loves me
She'll come back
She wants to try

I won't let her
She'll be upset
I know it's better
Than something I'll regret
She's been dishonest
And insincere
I lost my mind
Twenty times a year

[Chorus 2]
Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains

Woke up today
I'm alone
I look around
But, baby, you were gone
But I don't mind
And I don't worry
I will survive

I'm alone
Now that you're gone
Don't need nobody
To hold or tie me down
I broke the chains
So let me be
I've gotta be free

[Chorus 2]
Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains
Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains

Unless you say my name (A'ight)
Rippin', killin', diggin' and drillin' a hole

12964,Uncle Tom's Cabin,Warrant,"Just for the record, let's get the story straight
Me and Uncle Tom were fishin', it was gettin' pretty late
Out on a cypress limb above the wishin' well
Where they say it got no bottom, say it take you down to hell

Over in the bushes and off to the right
Come two men talkin' in the pale moonlight
Sheriff John Brady and Deputy Hedge
Haulin' two limp bodies down to the water's edge

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, oh, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell

They didn't see me and Tom in the tree
Neither one believin' what the other could see
Tossed in the bodies, let 'em sink on down
To the bottom of the well where they'd never be found

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, oh, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies in the wishin' well

[Guitar Solo]

Soon as they were gone, me and Tom got down
Prayin' real hard that we wouldn't make a sound
Runnin' through the woods back to Uncle Tom's shack
Where the full moon shines through the rooftop cracks

Oh my God, Tom, who are we gonna tell?
The Sheriff, he belongs in a prison cell
Keep your mouth shut, that's what we're gonna do
Unless you wanna wind up in the wishing well too

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, ooh, yeah, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell
Oh, I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies, know who put the bodies
In the wishin' well, oh, yeah

We made it once, she said, ""Make me again""
She wrapped her love around me all night long

I never really got her out of my head
And now and then she makes those social calls
Gives me a squeeze, gets me kickin' the walls
Now let me tell ya', it still feels tight
And we were shakin' after every bite
I feel her comin' in the middle of the night
Screamin' higher

Fall

Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath
It's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover

Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere

Fall

Watch the end through dying eyes
Now the dark is taking over
Show me where forever dies
Take the fall
And run to heaven

All is lost again
But I'm not giving in

[Chorus]
I will not bow
I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall
I will not fade
I will take your breath away

And I'll survive
Paranoid
I have lost the will to change
And I am not proud
Coldblooded fake
I will shut the world away

Open your eyes

I will not bow
I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall
I will not fade
I will take your breath away

And I'll survive
Paranoid
I have lost the will to change
And I am not proud
Coldblooded fake
I will shut the world away

Did you hear the one about me being a punk?
Did you hear the one about me being a drunk?
Did you hear the one about me losing my nerve?
Or how I'm just another fucking sheep in the herd?
Did you hear about the money, how it made me change?
So funny to me, all the time that they waste
Did you hear the one about me giving a shit?
'Cause if I ever did, I don't remember it

Selling my soul and changing my name?
Did you hear the one about me being a prick?
Did you know I don't care, and you can suck my‚Äî?

Fist in the air and a finger to the sky?
Do I care if you hate me? Do you wanna know the truth?

Ahhhh

Dig me out
I‚Äôm trapped inside this reality
With all this bloodshed and suffering
That‚Äôs‚ÄÖall‚ÄÖdealt by our‚ÄÖown hands
Our living nightmare
This
World is run‚ÄÖby the violence
Of sins committed in silence
Death, destruction and distain
Between good and evil

World run by power
World run by money
Religious business
For the superstitious
World run by fear
World run by chaos
No one to hear
No one to save us
World run by war
World run by killing
No one survives
Everyone dies

We think we‚Äôre justified
To kill innocent souls
That choose to not abide
To our damn fiendish rules
We‚Äôve all been separated
Through our absurdity

By all our prejudice
Ideals, uncertainty

This world was once together
Now it is falling apart
Destined to all end this way
All planned right from the start
The truths are hidden from us
We‚Äôre victims of deceit

We‚Äôre told that we‚Äôll be saved
That this is not the end
Just as we lay here and bleed
No justice to comprehend

We all deserve paradise
But always made to suffer
Living meaningless lives
When we are something greater
Slaving away for others
Just to make them all richer
Our days are numbered to live
What else do we have to give?

This is our revolution

We have to make a change
We have to come together
We have to take control
And make this world much better

Yeah

This is our revolution

Blegh

This is our revolution

This world was once together
Now has fallen apart
Destined to all end this way
All planned right from the start
We have to make a change
We have to come together
We have to take control
And make this world much better

But every step forward is closer to home

One of my eyes can only see the past
My line of sight broken, I can only look back

You, my friend
You're a lot like them
But I caught your lie
And you know I did
Now I'm lost in you
Like I always do
And I'll die to win
Cause I'm born to lose

[Chorus]
Firefly
Could you shine your light?
Now I love your ways
'Cause they're just like mine
Now I'm justified
As I fall in line
And it's hard to try
When you're open wide

[Verse 2]
Take my hand
We'll be off and then
We'll come back again
To a different land
Now I like this way
You can go away
If you guess the name
You cannot replace

[Chorus]
Firefly
Could you shine your light?
Now I love your ways
'Cause they're just like mine
Now I'm justified
As I fall in line
And it's hard to try
When you're open wide

[Bridge]
Bring me your enemies
Lay them before me
And walk away
Walk away
Walk away!

[Chorus]
Firefly
Could you shine your light?
Now I love your ways
'Cause they're just like mine
Now I'm justified
As I fall in line
And it's hard to try
When you're open wide
Fuck you, firefly
Have you lost your light?
Now I hate your ways
'Cause they're just like mine
So you lost, my friend
Such a sorry end
And I don't know why
So I choke and smile

[Outro]
Smile!

13037,Follow,Breaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
I'm losing sight, don't count on me
I chase the sun, it chases me

[Pre-Chorus]
You know my name, you know my face
You'd know my heart if you knew my place
I'll walk straight down, as far as I can go

[Chorus]
I'll follow you; you follow me
I don't know why you lie so clean
I'll break right through the irony

[Verse 2]
Enlighten me, reveal my fate
Just cut these strings that hold me safe

[Pre-Chorus]
You know my head, you know my gaze
You'd know my heart if you knew your place
I'll walk straight down, as far as I can go

I'll follow you; you follow me
I don't know why you lie so clean
I'll break right through the irony

I, I hate this wait

I don't know why you lie so clean
I'll break right through the irony

13049,Bones,Young Guns,"[Verse 1]
Down under the night sky I lay and wait
Praying to whoever will listen to me
I'd fashioned my own cross, been crushed by its weight
There's no stronger message than dirt in your face

[Chorus]
I've seen down the end of the road, I deal in a different story
Oh, I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones (Bones), bones (Bones)
I feel it in my bones (Bones), bones (Bones)
I'll do this on my own, own, own, own
Bones, bones, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
They say the spirit's willing, but the flesh is always weak
I found everything I needed right beneath my skin, oh

[Chorus]
I've seen down the end of the road, I deal in a different story
Oh, I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones (Bones), bones (Bones)
I feel it in my bones (Bones), bones (Bones)
I'll do this on my own

[Bridge]
We're all architects of our own private hell
No one can hurt us like we've hurt ourselves

[Chorus]
I've seen down the end of the road, I deal in a different story
Oh, I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones (Bones), bones (Bones)
I feel it in my bones (Bones), bones (Bones)
I know I'm not alone, bones, bones, bones
Bones, bones, bones

13018,I Feel Alive,Steady Rollin,"The trees, are singing in the wind
The sky blue, only as it can be
And the angels, smiled at me

I saw you, in that lonely bench
At half past four, I kissed your soft soft hands and at 6 I kissed your lips and the angels smiled, I thought

Hey I feel alive!

The park sign, said it was closed
And we jumped that fence with no cares at all and we kissed under a tree

We danced, under the midnight sun
And I loved you, without knowing you at all and we laughed and felt so free and the angels they smiled, I thought

Hey, I feel alive!
"
13046,Electric,Tyler Gilbert,"You speak in absolutes but your purpose here is unclear
You feel you're owed something I‚Äôll see you in the dirt beside me
Leave me alone just the way I am
I am the cockroach, you can never kill thee

If all this is electric
Then what have you done
If all this is determined
Then why have you come
Underdog

I am the one your mother told you to be afraid of
I will not sympathize with all the problems you made up
You think you're something else I‚Äôll be the one to let you know
I‚Äôll be there standing tall wait for you to fall to let you go
"
13017,Wrong Side Of Heaven,Five Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]
I spoke to God today
And she said that she's ashamed
What have I become?
What have I done?
I spoke to the devil today
And he swears he's not to blame
And I understood
'Cause I feel the same

[Chorus]
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side
The righteous side of Hell

[Verse 2]
I heard from God today
And she sounded just like me
What have I done?
And who have I become?
I saw the devil today
And he looked a lot like me
I looked away
I turned away

[Chorus]
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side
The righteous side of Hell

[Bridge]
I'm not defending
Downward descending
Falling further and further away
Getting closer every day
I'm getting closer every day
To the end
To the end, the end, the end
I'm getting closer every day

[Chorus]
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side
The righteous side of Hell

13041,Colors,Crossfade,"[Verse 1: Ed Sloan, Mitch James]
Can you feel it crush you? Does it seem to bring the worst in you out?
There's no runnin' away from these things that hold you down
Do they complicate you, because they make you feel like this?
Of all the colors that you've shined, this is surely not your best
But you should know these colors that you're shinin' are...

[Chorus: Ed Sloan & Mitch James]
Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine

[Verse 2: Ed Sloan, Mitch James]
I know you feel alone, yeah, and no one else can figure you out
But don't you ever turn away from the ones that help you down
Well, they'd love to save you. Don't you know they love to see you smile?
But these colors that you've shined, are surely not your style
But you should know these colors that you're shinin' are...

[Chorus: Ed Sloan & Mitch James]
Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine

[Bridge: Mitch James]
I know you're feelin' like you're lost
But you should know these colors that you're shining are...
I know you're feeling like you're lost
You feel you've drifted way too far
Did you know these colors that you're shinin' are...

[Chorus: Ed Sloan & Mitch James]
Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine

[Outro: Mitch James, Ed Sloan & Mitch James]
Surely not the best
I know you're feeling like you're lost
Colors that you shine
But you should know these colors that you're shining are...
Surely not the best
I know you're feelin' like you're lost
You feel you've drifted way too far
Did you know these colors that you're shining are...

13047,Trenches,Pop Evil,"[Verse 1]
No time to hide
I'm alive on the inside
Breaking up my mind on the front lines
Will I survive? Will I survive another day?
This great divide
Side by side on the inside
Breaking up our minds on the front lines
Never again, never again will I be denied

[Pre-Chrous]
'Cause here I come
(Oh, Whoa-oh-oh)
'Cause here I come
(Oh, Whoa-oh-oh)
'Cause here I come, here I come

[Chrous]
I've waited all my life to get out of the trenches
I'm ready to fight for what I believe you can steal from me
I won't take this
Gonna fill these trenches
And stand up, wake up, I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, stuck in a hole, damage control
Digging for rhymes on a secondhand cell phone
Will I survive? Will I survive another year?
Still month to month
Paying my dues on the inside
Breaking up my mind on the outside
Never again, never again will I be denied

[Pre-Chrous]
'Cause here I come
(Oh, Whoa-oh-oh)
'Cause here I come
(Oh, Whoa-oh-oh)
'Cause here I come, here I come

I've waited all my life to get out of the trenches
I'm ready to fight for what I believe you can steal from me
I won't take this
Gonna fill these trenches
And stand up, wake up, I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come

[Bridge]
'Cause here I come, here I come
'Cause here I come, here I come

[Chrous]
I've waited all my life to get out of the trenches
I'm ready to fight for what I believe you can steal from me
I won't take this
Gonna fill these trenches
And stand up, wake up, I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come

Stand up, wake up, I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come

You gotta feel courage
Embrace possession

Be a fighter, backbone desire
Complicated, and it stings
But we both know what it means
And it's time to get real and inspired

13012,Lift Me Up,Five Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1: Ivan Moody]
It ain't no mystery I'm all I have left
I'm pushing back and runnin' you over
I've been thrown down, run around
Beaten till I hit the ground
I'm telling you right now that it's over
There's no room for mistakes, all the parts are in place
Say what you will, but say it to my face
Better back the fuck up, better shut the fuck up
I'll do what I want, and I'll never give up

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down
I have the answers
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this, the flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken, the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
(Lift me up!)

[Verse 2: Rob Halford]
I'm gonna change history, enlighten the world
Teach 'em how to see through my eyes
I'm gonna lash back, check that, fatal as a heart attack
Stomp out all the ugliest lies
You can't convince me to change, we ain't on the same page
I've had my fill, now there's nothing but rage
Best get out of my way
'Cause there's nothing to say
Is that all that you got? Because I ain't got all day

I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down
I have the answers
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken, the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away

13009,Coming Down,Five Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]
It's caving in around me
What I thought was solid ground
I tried to look the other way
But I couldn't turn around
It's okay for you to hate me
For all the things I've done
I've made a few mistakes
But I'm not the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
Step away from the ledge
I'm coming down

[Chorus]
I could never be what you want me to
You pull me under to save yourself (Save yourself)
You will never see what's inside of me
I pull you under just to save myself

[Verse 2]
Was there ever any question
On how much I could take?
You kept feeding me your bullshit
Hoping I would break
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anyone who cares?
Is there anybody listening?
Will they hear my final prayers?

[Pre-Chorus]
Step away from the ledge
I'm coming down

[Chorus]
I could never be what you want me to
You pull me under to save yourself (Save yourself)
You will never see what's inside of me
I pull you under just to save myself (Save myself)

(Caving in)
It's tearing me apart

It's all coming down around me

You pull me under; I pull you under

13044,Never Enough,Five Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]
I'm so fed up with everyone around me
No one seems to care
I'm just so far gone and nothing's gonna change
I'll never be the same

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's always, ""Do this,"" ""Do that,"" everything they want to
I don't want to live that way (No!)
Every chance they get, they're always

No matter what I say
It's never enough; no, it's never enough
I'll never be what you want me to be

I don't want to live that way (No!)

It's never enough; no, it's never enough
I'll never be what you want me to be
I'm done!
(I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done)

[Bridge]
In the end, we're all just chalk lines on the concrete
Drawn only to be washed away
For the time that I've been given
I am what I am
I'd rather hate you for everything you are
Than ever love you for something you are not
I'd rather you hate me for everything I am
Than have you love me for something that I can't

[Outro]
It's never enough, it's never enough
No matter what I say
It's never enough; no, it's never enough
No matter who I try to be
It's never enough; no, it's never enough
No matter how I try to change
It's never enough, never, never enough
I'll never be what you want me to be

13050,The Diary of Jane,Breaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
If I had to, I would put myself right beside you
So let me ask, ""Would you like that? Would you like that?""
And I don't mind if you say this love is the last time
So now I'll ask, ""Do you like that? Do you like that?"" (No!)

[Chorus]
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

[Verse 2]
Try to find out what makes you tick
As I lie down, sore and sick
Do you like that, do you like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate
And I don't mind, just let me say
That I like that, I like that

[Chorus]
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page, as I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

Desperate, I will crawl
Waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone
What have I become?

I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page, as I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane

13065,Inside Out,Five Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]
Take it, I don't need it (I don't need it)
I don't wanna hear your motherfuckin'‚ÄÖside
You‚ÄÖcan love it‚ÄÖ(You can love it)
Or you can‚ÄÖleave it (Or you can leave it)
Because nothing I say and nothing I feel is right
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't understand
While I'm sitting up here dying, you're just holding out your hand
And even if I wanted to, I couldn't have explained
'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no denying it, you've never had control

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out

[Verse 2]
I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave)
It doesn't matter how much money I get paid
I give a shit (I give a shit), I never did (I never did)
So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin
If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear?
Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear?
If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere?
'Cause in the end, I'll never bend, I'll never shed a tear

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no denying it, I've always had control

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out
(Inside out)

[Bridge]
How you've turned me inside out
Inside out
Inside out
How you've turned me inside out
I'm inside out
So inside out

I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out
Inside out

I need a short-term fix for a long-term problem
Can I learn to love these chains?
I‚ÄÖknow‚ÄÖI had a‚ÄÖpoint, but now I forgot it
While‚ÄÖI'm circlin' the drain

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't stop feelin' like every day's exactly the same
With a one-track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Lift me up, lifting me up

13097,You'll Never Find Me,Korn,"[Verse 1]
Life is degrading and silently making me
Spun out inside my own head
Spewing and craving, this darkness is baiting me
Down the road to my own death

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide

It feeds on the doubt in my heart
Sinking and fading, our feelings I'm saving
To fix what I tore all apart

Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide

13063,DEVIL,Shinedown,"[Intro]
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick up the phone

[Verse 1]
You said it yourself: you're scared of being alone
You said it yourself that you can crack the code
But the static you hear automatically keeps you exposed, on your own
I hope you're ready, steady, smashing through the levy
The drama, the trauma, don't play the prima donna
My God
You said it yourself that you would never stop
Until you felt the needle drop

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you pack your bags, the party's such a drag
And everyone can tell that you're poisoning the well
But there are no mistakes, except what you create
You need to know your place

'Cause it's about to get heavy (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
It's about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)

And everyone can tell that you're poisoning the well
But there are no mistakes, except what you create
You need to know your place

It's about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)

Excuses, excuses are all that I hear
All I can see when I look in the mirror
I can't escape all these thoughts in my mind
They're waiting to haunt me night after night

If this is who I am, do I know myself?

This is it, babe, you're all mine

Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
I know that I am good for something
So, lets go, give it a try
We got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
With you, I know that I am good for something
So, lets go, give it a try
We got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I

I can't convince you to just believe this is real

I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 1]
I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 2]
Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

[Bridge]
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Outro]
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?

Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me
And speak, but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore, you see
It aches in every bone
I'll die alone, but not for you
My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing
I know it's me, you fear
If you want me, hold me back

The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away
So come, sit by the fire and play a while
But you can't stay too long

It's been eroded by the weather here
If you want me, hold me back

Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie

13089,Rorschach,Zero Theorem,"You believe what you project onto
Your past taints another child
You waste your time in debate
Judging ink or a lack of branding
Close the door to any other way
You let nobody explain

Forgiveness is a privilege to earn

How are you the voice of the people
When you think you are not equal?
It‚Äôs too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes
How are you the voice of the people
When you feed us lies to believe you?
It‚Äôs too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes

You think that you need an audience
You think that fear will spread the doubt
I think you've lost your way
What you see is not completely broken
Outward scars will fade in time
But inward cuts remain

Forgiveness is a privilege to earn

How are you the voice of the people
When you think you are not equal?
It‚Äôs too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes
How are you the voice of the people
When you feed us lies to believe you?
It‚Äôs too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes

You painted yourself in the corner
You burned the bridge
Suffer the life you give
Who will take you out of the restraints
When the ink in your eyes has dried?

How are you the voice of the people
When you think you are not equal?
It‚Äôs too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes
How are you the voice of the people?
You don‚Äôt even understand
It‚Äôs too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes

My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage, doing shots
Tip the man, he'll ring the bell
Get her drunk, she'll scream like hell
Dirty girl, gettin' down, dance with guys from outta town
Grab her ass, actin' tough, mess with her, she'll fuck you up

No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight

She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end

She's a bad, bad girlfriend

Red thong, party's on, love this song, sing along
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home

But I'm gonna find out later tonight

Doesn't take her long to make things right
But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life?
The time of her life

She's a gold digger, now you figure out it's over, pull the trigger
Futures finished, there it went, savings gone, the money spent
Look around and all I see, no good, bad, and ugly
Man she's hot and fixed to be the future ex-Miss Connolly

She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat

13066,Anthem Of The Lonely,Nine Lashes,"[Verse 1]
A heart made of stone
Callus and bone
Fracture and tear it out
To let it go
And to think I called it my own
And I would have never thought
The pain could grow

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll break it
Knowing what you said
The pain is what you make it
Sadly, you are so mistaken
I will take it with a grain
And step into the changes
Throw away the empty heart

[Chorus]
Right now, never want to leave this place
And right now, see it in a different way
So right now, even if you take me on
I'll stand, the lonely
Stand, the lonely

[Verse 2]
It's harder to know just where to go
If only the stars aligned
The sunsets glowed
I don't need the calm in a storm
Or something to scream about
With empty lungs

So I'll break it
Knowing what you said
The pain is what you make it
Sadly you are so mistaken
I will take it with a grain
And step into the changes
Throw away the empty heart

And right now, see it in a different way

As the laughter dies, an angel cries

Well it seems that I was lost in intoxicated nights
Following the trace of ecstasy
With no future and no past, just the present was alive
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream

I was drowning in a feeling that obsession rules
Till the morning kills the creatures of the night
And I read your lipstick message on the mirror of the truth
Now that you're gone, I realize

Without you
Life's like a song without music
Without you
This world won't be the same

I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay

Well I know that I was lost in a nightmare of my life
Following the flash of fantasy
In a feeling that exploded I'd left reality behind
Addicted to the power of the dream

Without you
Life's like that road that leads nowhere
Without you
The world won't feel the same

[Chorus]
I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay

Without you

The dogs are on the run
The cats are all in heat
Out in the streets
Snakes are all around you
Dirty rats are on their way
They control you and they'll make you play

Out in the night
Glaring eyes in darkness
Tigers wanna fight
Out in the night

Spinning webs and make you pray
Tie you up and you can't get away

If you don't play along with their games
Bad boys running wild
And you better get out of their way

13109,Follow Your Heart,Scorpions,"Have you ever climbed the mountain?
Have you ever crossed the sea?
Take a look around the corner
And listen to your heartbeat

Have you ever touched the rainbow
Take a ride in the ferris wheel
It takes one step to start a journey
It's up to you, to make it real

This is the time for yourself to be free
You gotta follow your heart
This is the time in your life and it's never too late
To see the light in the dark
You gotta follow your heart

Walking far away horizons
You will never walk alone
You'll be at home where your heart is
A million miles away from home

Show me the way, who knows the way
This is the only road to go
Life brings me down, it takes me up
And only, only heaven knows

I'm in love with the falling rain
Everything seems to call your name
Yesterday you were leaving
Leaving life and all the pain
Everything wants you back again
Wants you back again
Wants you back again

I've found myself through you
And there was love in my life
I felt always naturally high
And my love had a home
But now my mind has started to roam
You're my life giving fire
And you carried all my love
Through you I was so inspired
You're engraved deep in my heart

My dreams recall us being one
I've searched for you to be free
My force of life you have always been
I feel blue since you've gone
Your breath of love surrounded me
When can I rejoin you to be free?
Rejoin you to be free
Rejoin you to be free

Wait, can this be a dream?
There is a voice in my head
It belongs to you, it says
Don't cry, no need to be sad
There's a way to stay with you again
It's more than you ever had
And no death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows
Because you are in my other heart

I know we've never been apart
Your love sets fire to my heart

While your traces disappear
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive

All along I was scared to breathe
So afraid that the world was gonna leave me behind
In the dark, I refused to see
That I was barely alive
It's such a bitter pill to swallow
But I learned to call it ""reality""
I didn't wanna wake up, I didn‚Äôt wanna wake up
I didn't wanna wake up and miss the misery

[Verse 2]
All along I refused to believe
Paranoid that my fear already left me to die
In the end, when I stopped, I could see
That I was feeding the lie
Caught in between another time and place
When no one cared to know my name
Feels like it's never enough
When is it ever enough?

[Pre-Chorus]
I build it up just to tear it back down again
Fighting fate only to surrender, only to surrender

I'm the worst at letting go
To the scars I loved the most
Will they bury me, bury me now?
Running from the worst in me
Left me broken, wondering
Will they bury me, bury me now?

I didn't wanna wake up, I didn't wanna wake up
I didn't wanna wake up and miss the misery

I hold the key to escaping my reality
I hold the key to creating my identity

I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality
If there's an afterlife, then it'll set you free

Into heart of the demon
With no escape our die is cast

No fear of the hatred they preach

[Verse 3]
Don't run, there's no place to hide
Today or tomorrow it will get you
Don't move, the knife is right at your throat
And whatever you do, there's no way out
When the shroud comes down on this place
To bury us all alive
We'll know the time has come, to face the heat

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

Arrive at seven, the place feels good
No time to call you today
Encores 'til eleven, then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again

I call your number, the line ain't free
I'd like to tell you come to me
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love, I can't tell you how I feel

[Refrain]
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again

Another morning, another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again

Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again

13100,Cross Off,Mark Morton,"[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Cross off the days gone
Cross off the days gone
Gone by

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Wasting away
A self-inflicted slow decay
What should've been, what never was
Became the end for both of us

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger)
Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger)
So lay them all to waste
Years you decided to erase
And cross off the days

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Cutting you free
The phantom limb was part of me
You have lived, you have lost
The separation's worth the cost

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Heavy are the words that go unspoken (Spoken)
Heavy are the promises now broken (Broken)
Will you learn to love the taste
Of the destruction in your wake?
Cross off the days

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Gone by
Making my way back from the madness
Shifting my thoughts from the blackness
And the sadness, but the fact is
I'm swinging through life like a clenched fist
Fuck sanity, I wanna bleed
Can't kill the pain, it's everything
It's all I feel, it's what I breathe
Turn the hate I breed into what I need
Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger)
Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger)

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Did you survey everything you laid to waste
And cross off the days?

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by

13136,Stranger In My House,Ronnie Milsap,"[Verse 1]
There's a silence here between us
I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

[Verse 2]
She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's alright
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know?
Or somebody she just met?
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

[Verse 3]
Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination?
Or has her love turned into lies?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
A stranger in my house

13140,Hallowed Be Thy Name,Iron Maiden,"[Intro]
I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah

[Verse 1]
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

[Verse 2]
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall, but why am I crying?
After all, I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, ""God be with you""
If there's a God, why has He let me go?
As I walk, my life drifts before me
And though the end is near, I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

[Verse 4]
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah

13147,Takin' Care Of Business,Bachman-Turner Overdrive,"[Verse 1]
You get up every morning from alarm clock's warning
Take the 8:15 into the city
There's a whistle up above and people pushing, people shoving
And the girls who try to look pretty
And if your train's on time, you can get to work by nine
And start your slavin' jobs and get your pay
If you ever get annoyed, look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

[Chorus]
And I've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
I've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and working overtime, work out
Whoo

[Verse 2]
If it were easy as fishing, you could be a musician
If you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a secondhand guitar, chances are you'll go far
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows
People see you having fun just a-lying in the sun
You tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid and we're all self-employed
We love to work at nothing all day

And we've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
We've been takin' care of business, it's all mine

13145,Rock the Casbah,The Clash,"[Verse 1]
Now the king told the boogie men
""You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shaken to the top""
The Sheikh, he drove his Cadillac
He went a-cruising down the ville
The Muezzin was a-standing on the radiator grille

[Chorus]
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 2]
By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
The Bedouin, they brought out
The electric kettle drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar-picking thumb
As soon as the Sharif
Cleared the square
They began to wail

[Chorus]
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 3]
Now over at the temple
Oh, they really pack 'em in
The in-crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff of that crazy Casbah jive

[Chorus]
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 4]
The king called up his jet fighters
He said, ""You better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way""
As soon as the Sharif was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Sharif was
Out of their hair
The jet pilots wailed

[Chorus]
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah

Thinks it's not kosher

She said I had it comin' to me

Could fit into the center of our hand?
Then you found it wasn't you
Who held the sum of everything you knew

Yeow
Yeow
Yeow

[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah

[Verse 3]
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
Mmm, yeah

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
Mmm, yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Mmm, mean it, get down

Wanna tell you a story
About the house-rent blues

[Verse 1]
I come home one Friday
Had to tell the landlady I done lost my job
She said, ""That don't befront me
Long as I get my money next Friday""
Now, next Friday come, I didn't get the rent
And out the door I went

[Verse 2]
So I goes to the landlady
I said, ""You let me slide?
I'll have the rent for ya tomorrow, the next day, I don't know""
So she let me slide it on, you know, people
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me
But for five year she was so nice
Lord, she was lovey-dovey

[Verse 3]
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said, ""You got the rent money yet?""
I said, ""No, can't find no job
Therefore, I ain't got no money to pay the rent""
She said, ""I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job""
Said, ""I seen you today, you were standin' on a corner
Leaning up against a post""
I said, ""But I'm tired
I been walkin' all day""
She said, ""That don't confront me
Long as I get my money next Friday""
Now, next Friday come, I didn't have the rent
And out the door I went

[Verse 4]
So I go down the streets
Down to my good friend's house
I said, ""Look, man, I'm outdoors, you know
Can I stay with you maybe a couple of days?""
He said, ""Ah, let me go and ask my wife""
He come out of the house
I could see it in his face, I know that was ""No""
He said, ""Ah, I don't know, man, ah, she kinda funny, you know""
I said, ""I know, everybody funny
Now you funny too""

[Verse 5]
So I go back home
I tell the landlady, ""I got a job, I'm gonna pay the rent""
She said, ""Yeah?"", I said, ""Oh yeah""
And then she was so nice
Lord, she was lovey-dovey

[Verse 6]
So I go in my room, pack up my things, and I go
I slip on out the back door, and down the streets I go
She a-howlin' about the front rent
She'll be lucky to get any back rent
She ain't gonna get none of it

[Verse 7]
So I stop in the local bar, you know, people
I go to the bar, I ring my coat, I call the bartender
Said, ""Look, man, come down here""
He got down there, ""So what you want?""

[Chorus]
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Well, I ain't seen my baby since I don't know when
I've been drinking bourbon, whiskey, scotch, and gin
Gonna get high, man, I'm gonna get loose
Need me a triple-shot of that juice
Gonna get drunk, don't you have no fear
I want one bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

[Verse 8]
But I'm sitting now
At the bar
I'm getting drunk
I'm feelin' mellow
I'm drinkin' bourbon, I'm drinkin' scotch, I'm drinkin' beer
Looked down the bar
Here come the bartender
I said, ""Look, man, come down here""
""So what you want?""

[Chorus]
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
No, I ain't seen my baby since the night before last
Gotta get a drink, man, I'm gonna get gassed
Gonna get high, man, I ain't had enough
Need me a triple shot of that stuff
Gonna get drunk, won't you listen right here?
I want one bourbon, one shot, and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Well, all right

[Bridge]
Yeah
Scratch my back, baby
Yeah

[Verse 9]
Now, by this time I'm plenty high
You know, when your mouth a-getting dry, you're plenty high
Looked down the bar, I see to my bartender
I said, ""Look, man, come down here""
He got down there, ""So what you want this time?""
I said, ""Look, man, a-what time is it?""
He said, ""The clock on the wall say three o'clock
A-last call, for alcohol; so what you need?""

[Chorus]
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
Lord, I ain't seen my baby since a-nigh on a week
Gotta get drunk, man, so I can't even speak
Gonna get high, man, listen to me
One drink ain't enough, Jack, you better make it three
Gonna get drunk, I'm gonna make it real clear
I want one bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

A hundred hearts energized in the thundering roar
Simultaneously a thousand colliding thunderbolts
And too, ten thousand lightning strikes in the heavens

I might stick around
If you want to say that I trust you
I might stick around

If you disappear
Then nothing will be clear, ah
And if you go away
Then where am I to stay, ah
To stay, ah

If you say your love won't bring me down
I might stick around
If I kiss your lips just one more time
I could lose control

If you disappear
Then nothing will be clear, ah
And if you go away
Then where am I to stay, ah
To stay, ah

If I breathe your scent just one more time
I could be controlled
If you tempt me with your final sins
I could be controlled

If you disappear
Then nothing will be clear, ah
And if you go away
Then where am I to stay, ah
To stay, ah...(repeat and fade)

13154,Kiss from a Rose,Wake Me,"There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
There is so much a man can t–µll you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pl–µasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray

I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny

13159,Memory of a Free Festival,David Bowie,"[Intro]
""Maybe I should announce it, should I?
Memory of a free festival""

[Verse 1]
The children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

[Verse 2]
Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

[Verse 3]
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same

[Verse 4]
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road, unchained

[Outro]
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party

13156,Over The Hills And Far Away,Gary Moore,"They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

They marched him to the station house
He waited till the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
""You stand accused of robbery,""
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Just where he'd been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms again he'll be
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills and
Over the hills and
Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms again she'll be

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
As sure as the river reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the sea
Back in her arms is where he'll be

Over the hills
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills
Over the hills and far away

Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now

Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Pre-Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb

The tiger overcomes the leopard in‚ÄÖa‚ÄÖmatch
The elephant thrashes‚ÄÖthe leopard in a contest
Man intensely‚ÄÖstruggles with a leopard to contend

We, the lions slaughter the leopards in a match
The tiger beats the leopard in a contest
The elephant trounces the leopard in a fight
Man strenuously strains with a leopard in contention

An instigator, the jealousy of a snake it could be
And Khan Garuda leaps up above into the air
A growl, the jealousy of a tiger it could be
The blue wolf comes too from far away

Hu - hu - hu - hu...
Hu - hu - hu - hu...

Provoked, the snow leopard competes with it's rivals

Ten thunderbolts strike at the same time
A hundred hearts energized in the thundering roar
Simultaneously a thousand colliding thunderbolts
And too, ten thousand lightning strikes in the heavens

Hu - hu - hu - hu...
Hu - hu - hu - hu...

This deluge is the leopard battling in a deadly fight
The surges of the leopard scuffling in competion
The awesome leopard swats, blows to overthrow
The glistening leopard slashes in the scramble

Hu - hu - hu - hu...
Hu - hu - hu - hu...

With the speed of the falcon advancing
The wolf's courage at times flaring up
The strength of horses hooves, their paces pounding
The mark of Genghis Khan, an overwhelming impression

Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord

Army of pigs try to silence my style

Come with reckless abandon full of reckless intent
Without a care, without restraint, and now I'm fucking bent
Malevolent and violent to the marrow in my bones
If you‚Äôre not helping me, you‚Äôre hurting me, and pain is what you're owed

A little tight in the shoulder
But you know, it still fit me good
I wear a 36 long, white is my color

But you know, it still fit me good

Anyone can see we're a perfect match
An innocent boy and a psychopath
A week's worth of dating and you talk about moving in
(I talk about moving too fast)
My mom disapproved and my friends would say
To break the girl's heart but I'm too afraid
Her clickbait body was a tractor beam
She was a Tesla Model S with the ludicrous speed
The sex was good but we always fight
I'd try to leave your sorry ass but end up spending the night
Your sweetness, my weakness, you're mean though ingenious
Nothing can go between us (Aye, have you seen us?)

'Cause it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my brain
Hallucinating
Girl, well it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my mind

[Verse 2]
Free at last, I'm free at last
Something I'll never say is ""I'm free at last""
She ain't around so I can vent and get it off my chest
(So here we go, three, two, one)
And you're supercali-pessimistic-expiali-narcissistic
You are Mary Poppins, you'll be soon be going out of business
Guys, let me witness, you got a Honda Civic
'Cause you're backseat driving my life

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna sleep my life away
I must be

[Chorus]
Out of my mind, be going crazy
'Cause it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my brain
Hallucinating
Girl, well it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

[Verse 3]
I'm freaking out, I'm panic attacking
Yeah, I mentally had it, now my living room's padded
I'm a sadist, I'm addicted to this heroin
You're Tonya Harding and I'm your Nancy Kerrigan
Like Lloyd Braun, I just wanted serenity
But you had to go testing me, gave me suicide tendencies
Your little games, your little, little games
You tricked me into staying, your playing is getting lame
From touching your sweet things to tracking your calls
Go from smacking your ass to punching holes in the walls
Go from sending me fire news to eyeing up other dudes
From picking a favorite song to playlisting breaking tunes
Started so high, now I can hardly breathe
Go from weak in the knees to be too weak I can't leave
You called it, it's all my fault, this I know
Guess I'm better off dead inside than being alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna sleep my life away
Oh!

[Chorus]
I must be out of my mind, be going crazy
'Cause it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my brain
Hallucinating
Girl, well it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my mind

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, oh
I must be out of my mind

And you're supercali-pessimistic-expiali-narcissistic
You are Mary Poppins, you'll be soon be going out of business

Yeah, oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

13215,Bulletproof,Godsmack,"[Verse 1]
Contemplating, isolating
And it's stressing me out
Different visions, contradictions
Why won't you let me out?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I need a way to separate
But I promised you that I'll make sure you never forget me
(Never forget me)

[Chorus]
Now that you want it
Now that you need it

You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
Believe me, I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
You made me so bulletproof (Bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone

[Verse 2]
You're addicted and so twisted

Distant eyes, it's no surprise
You can't do anything now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I need a way to separate
But I'm telling you that nothing will ever be the same

Now that you want it
Now that you need it
I'm too far gone

13207,Renegade Music,Papa Roach,"[Verse 1]
It's dark outside, a world on fire that no one's safe from
It's life or death, so hold your breath or suffocate them
Provoking fears with smoke and mirrors, the tension's rising
We waste our time and wait in line while nothing changes

[Pre-Chorus]
But nothing changes
Until the people get loud

[Chorus]
So get down
Everybody, everybody, get down
Take it to another level right now
No resolution
Stand up, this is renegade music
Everybody, everybody, get down
Take back your life right now
Are you ready for some new shit?
Stand up, this is renegade music
This is renegade music

[Verse 2]
A house in flames is not contained, the neighbors watching
But no one moves, they live by rules that give no options
We don't prevail, can tell no tales, a dead man walking
To replicate is playing safe, and nothing changes

[Pre-Chorus]
But nothing changes
Until the people get loud

[Chorus]
So get down
Everybody, everybody, get down
Take it to another level right now
No resolution
Stand up, this is renegade music

Take back your life right now
Are you ready for some new shit?

13241,Betray And Degrade,Seether,"[Intro]
Those voices yelling
And the pain is overwhelming
It's a faultline
And yeah, I'm guessing
That I should be kinda happy
It's a fault of mine

[Verse 1]
With all the tension
You still keep me second-guessing
'Cause I'm so benign
(Go on, go on, go)
And yeah, I know
It's kinda hard to let it go
It's all so asinine
(Go on, go on, go)

[Pre-Chorus]
We have to figure out another way to go
(So I can follow, so I can follow)
We have to figure out another way to go

[Chorus]
Betray and degrade me now
I'll savour how this emptiness defines you
And take from this tortured sound
My hands are bound
Your shallowness confines you

[Verse 2]
I'm never the same, I'm never enough
There's something dead inside me
I fell all alone and couldn't get up
With no one there to guide me

We have to figure out another way to go
(So I can follow, so I can follow)
We have to figure out another way to go

13230,Painless,Fozzy,"[Verse 1]
My life trapped in between
A whisper and a scream
A suicide machine of my own making
You medicate my brain
Like needles in my veins
Consumed in your embrace
There's no escaping

[Pre-Chorus]
My fix is the misery
Won't stop till the end of me
I can't feel anything

[Chorus]
Killing me one breath at a time
Caught in your web, I'm paralyzed
So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless, painless

(I can't, I can't, I can't)
I can't feel any pain
(I can't, I can't, I can't)

[Verse 2]
I drift into the gray
Half coma, half awake
My soul is yours to take
A waist-full river

I feel you under my skin
The knife is twisting within
Temptation always wins
It's never over

My fix is the misery
Won't stop till the end of me
I can't feel anything

Killing me one breath at a time
Caught in your web, I'm paralyzed

My life, my grave
Do you love me enough to finish me off
Don't leave me here this way

So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless

Killing me one breath at a time

13206,Ambush,Inklings,"[Verse 1]
Think of what we could have had
Matching scars, another drag
We don't
I thank the stars we don't

Nights in dingy toilet rooms
Deal a blow and talk resumes
Until
The morning light is still

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had enough
I'm getting out
'Cause it's getting kind of rough

And they say that love isn't easy
But I never learned a God damn thing
They say that love isn't easy
But a shot can help remove the sting
Yeah ye-eah, yeah

Quiet in the market down
Apart from bars that you're around
I don't
Miss the words you wrote

I never really knew my Dad
And lost the one I nearly had
And then
You made it worse again

I've had enough
I'm getting out
'Cause it's getting kind of ro-ough

It got kinda rough, I don't wanna pout
If they think I'm tough, I don't think I'll last another time

13234,Human,HELLYEAH,"[Intro]
I defy your defiance
It's all lies in alliance
I've been damaged, left in ruin
'Cause I'm broken, flawed, and human
(Human! Human! Human!)

[Verse 1]
You drove the stake in my worst mistake
Now I'm the one left alone
Brought out the evil that's the devil in me
And now I'm on my own
Inside the dark unknown
You told the lie you believed in me
Lights dimming low, lost the glow
You are the sin and so sinister
I'm just the soul you owe
The who you left unwhole

[Chorus]
I defy your defiance
It's all lies in alliance
I've been damaged, left in ruin
Because I'm broken, flawed, and just human
Heaven's sake is forsaken
Didn't create all creation
I've designed my undoing
Because I'm broken, flawed, and just human

[Verse 2]
You were the anger in all my danger
Old habits keep me this cold
You killed the light that enlightened me
My ark of dark afloat
Now I've lost all my hope
The spoiled child among all the children
The troll controlling me
You are the ire that fueled my fire
Stab my stability, I'm my worst enemy

I defy your defiance
It's all lies in alliance
I've been damaged, left in ruin
Because I'm broken, flawed, and just human
Heaven's sake is forsaken
Didn't create all creation

Because I'm broken, flawed, and just human

I'm standing in the dark
I've been damaged from the start
But I know it in my heart
That I won't be, be broken

[Verse 1: Matt Brandyberry]
You pushed me off to that dark space
Between a rock and a hard place
You hoped you found what would slow me down
But there ain't no stopping my heart rate
It could've been easy to part ways
But now you just feed me this parfait
Of bullshit with your lies mixed in
You can keep your games at the arcade

[Pre-Chorus: Danny Case & Matt Brandyberry]
It's nothing new to me, what you do to me
I've seen it all time and time again
I had to fall for me to find my head
I'm staying true to me, yeah, I know who to be
It might be hard for you to comprehend
That where we are in life is not the end

That I won't be, be broken

Who would I be if I gave in?
Didn't believe in my statements?
I dimmed the lights and I hid from life
And just buried the dreams that I'm chasing?
Who would I be if I wasted
Days and weeks in the basement?
If I up and quit and said, ""Fuck this shit""
How would I reach amazing?

It's nothing new to me, what you do to me

When the walls are closing in around me
Can I escape from my surroundings?

We can't undo what we have done, just face what's up ahead
We fight and we stumble, the fuse is lit, you better run now

I can't tell you what to do, this crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become, the outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end? That slow last breath of air

('Cause I've lost my reason)
We say, give me a push, a push through this

13228,House On Fire,Rise Against,"[Short Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, ""Move!""
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 2]
But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 3]
And how is it a thing?
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting out the rain
Feels like it's gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

[Chorus]
'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I can't let go of you
Of you, of you, of you, of you

13202,Torn in Two,Breaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
Is this the way it's got to be?
Ignite the fire inside of me
Embrace the life of tragedy
A tide of war and broken dreams

[Chorus]
I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise
I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

[Verse 2]
Is this the fate we fall between?
Deface the life inside of me
Drain the heart of atrophy
And take away the remedy

I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on

I am faded through
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise
I will fight this war for you

Hold on

13200,Oh My God,HELLYEAH,"[Verse 1]
The little boy in me that was wild with fright
Nobody came to my rescue when I called out that night
So many times, so many tries, so many cries for help in life
But it's too late now

[Chorus]
Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and here I come
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
'Cause I'm the bullet, and he's the gun

[Verse 2]
The struggle is real (It's so real)
My condition's critical in life, was I born to suffer 'til I die?
Darkness consumes me (It consumes me)
Draw the shades and stitch my eyes, watch my sanity unwind

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been drained of compassion
My finger's up, fuck the masses

[Chorus]
Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood

Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
'Cause I'm the bullet, and he's the gun

My hands off the wheel (Hands off the wheel)
Your process is complete, destroyed what matters most to me
The burden holds me (Holds on to me)
I'm just a product of my past, I'm like a book with one last match

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been drained of compassion
My finger's up, fuck the masses

[Chorus]
Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and here I come
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
'Cause I'm the bullet, and he's the gun

I've been drained of compassion
My finger's up, fuck the masses

Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood

Now the target's on your back, and here I come
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
'Cause I'm the bullet, and he's the gun, he's the gun, he's the gun

Yes or no, what is truth?
But a dirty black cloud comin' out of the blue?
I was wrong, I was right
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night

Break my bones, I don't care
All I ever wanted was a body to share

Someday will dry
We fight for our lives

Listen close, I can't hide
I'm a page torn from a broken spine
Sun gets low, I get high
Satellite searchin' for a sign of life

13205,Truth To the Weak,Fire From The Gods,"[Intro Chorus]
Giving up ain't an option
I'm‚Ää not built to collapse
But‚Ää I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die

[Verse 1]
(Yeah, speak them facts)
Yeah,‚Ää let me testify I'm still coming through
From‚Ää the bottom of the gutter
I put my all into this, yo that's word to my mother
Fuck‚Ää pageantry, I'm coming raw with the savagery
Addressing that cannibal mind that's trying to consume me
Get off of me
I'm trying to be the best that I can be
Take‚Ää a seat, I'll take an evolutionary leap
Kick knowledge to the powerless
While you commence retreat
Let it be, take the ""L"" admit defeat

[Pre-Chorus]
Let that boy speak
He bringing truth to the weak
Tell him

[Chorus]
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die

[Verse 2]
I told you before I don't break
But you looking at me like I got a target on my back
That shot you take
Here you go again trying to put me in my place
Let me remind you that man is a beast and not a waste
Question, how come you don't want to see me fly?
Why you tryna drag me in the ditch where the dead lie?
Why you wanna turn my body cold?
Deal me a shitty hand and then laugh when I fold

[Chorus]
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die

[Bridge]
I won't give in
I won't lay down or die
Nah

[Verse 3]
When I speak, I'm tryna bring truth to the weak walk with my head up, defeat I always see
Creeping in the shadow of my periphery
I'm keeping all the leeches out of my vicinity
Always keep it a hundo so they cannot challenge me
Expanding on my vision, find the truth that I now seek
I've seen it all, I have swam against the current
I've been through the trenches, I've also felt worthless
I turn my back on the bottom
I can't quit, I elevate
I'm passing through all my limits

[Pre-Chorus]
Now let that boy speak
He bringing truth to the weak
Tell him

[Chorus]
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die

13244,Rose Red Violent Blue,Stone Sour,"[Verse 1]
Excuse me, oh, pardon me, I'm
Still sticky on the inside
There comes a time when all I do
Is sit around in contemplation
And curse my situation
I'm just too bored for normal news

Be careful of what you wish for
Impossible to just ignore
One last time is all I need
To get my laughing stocks in order
They're on the rise this quarter
Beware of certain friends who sell you out
When everything is free

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I am to all of you
And I've got all these other things to do, to do

[Chorus]
Open up, I know enough; I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only youth
But I am much too old, I am much too old
I am much too old now...

[Verse 2]
Imagine this chaos theory
Makes all the prophets leery
Somebody's showing them the ropes...
Ooh, we use to hang ourselves with
Instead of quiet respites
We choose the noose in lieu of hope
Oh, rose red, oh, violent blue
I should've seen the clues
But this song is dumb and so am I

[Pre-Chorus]
Character assassinations
Aren't really observations
Stay home and ask yourself:
""Why am I so low when I'm so high, so high?""

[Chorus]
Open up, I know enough; I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only youth
But I am much too old, I am much too old
I am much too old now...

[Bridge]
Yeah!
Come on!

[Chorus]
Open up, I know enough; I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only youth
But I am much too old, I am much too old
I am much too old, I am much too old

When you see J3T thirty deep, he's down to brawl
Fuck the haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fucking disease
I got HU tatted on the front of my arms
The boulevard, brass knuckles in the back of the car
'Cause we drunk-drive Cadillacs, we never go far
But when you see us, motherfuckers, better know who we are
I got one thing to say to punk-asses who hate
Motherfuckers don't know, but you better watch what you say
From these industry fucks to these faggot-ass punks
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk
I'm already loud, maybe it's a little too late

You make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit
You're tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrists, get pissed, and go jump off a bridge
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky, didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kid's lips
That shit's as worse as it gets, this verse is over, I quit

Because there's nothing in my life except my dick and what I spit
So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots talking shit
Speaking of fag, already rapped with the drag
We killed him then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac
B-But you always press and you know I never stress
With Loki DMS, J-Johnny to my left
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
I grew up on drive-bys and LA gang signs
So what the fuck you know about being a gangster?
And what the fuck you know about being in danger?
You ain't doing this so you know you're just talking shit
Mad at all of us 'cause every song is a fucking hit

Pulling me, I can't breathe
Rescue me, darkness consuming
Tempting me, suffering
Break me free from the darkness inside me

[Verse 1]
Shadows take my hands as my mind begins to stray
I'm lost in captive eyes, I can't seem to look away
Testing my will, trying my faith
I'm drenched in my sins, I am dripping with shame
Defying my reasons, denying my heart
I descend to hellfire, I am torn apart

[Chorus]
I need somebody to deliver me from hell
I can't seem to find myself, I could use some help
Deliver me from hell

The serpent sends a smile, and the apple is laced
I tiptoe into the void, I long for the taste
The perversive pictures are fixed in my mind
I'm worshipping fiction, the blind lead the blind

I need somebody to deliver me from hell
I can't seem to find myself, I could use some help
Deliver me from hell

Forever

Forever

[Verse 1]
For the blood, for the sweat, for the fears and the things that betray us
For the cracks in the mirrors and the ones you bust on the pavement
We're awake in this dream, and we choose to believe
That the you that's in me is in everything
We're alive
We're alive

[Chorus]
It's who we are that keeps me believing
There's something here bigger than ourselves
If I'm wrong then why am I still feeling?
Who we are keeps me believing

[Verse 2]
For the pain, for the strength, for our will to hold on through the changes
From the now till the end, every second we count, we embrace it
As our faces erase and our bodies decay
As we move through the waves that echo our names
We're alive
We're alive

[Chorus]
It's who we are that keeps me believing
There's something here bigger than ourselves
If I'm wrong then why am I still feeling?
Who we are, keeps me believing
Keeps me believing

One more time we stand together
Never forget why; always remember
One more time we stand together
Always remember
It's who we are
We make it out alive
After all, it's down to you and I

It's who we are that keeps me believing
There's something here bigger than ourselves
If I'm wrong then why am I still feeling?

We're in the ruins of dreams
Vultures and their dead-end screams
The fragile sanctuary of home
Spit me out, find another clone
Need a revolution
To find the lost evolution
Waiting for the wind to turn
Avoiding truth and never learn
Never learn, never learn, never learn

So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes

Drop the bombs, build anew
Purge our thoughts for different views
Different mantra, different beat
Still heading for eternal sleep
Devoured by constant pressure
Always for someone else‚Äôs pleasure
Not sure what you see in the scope
Afraid we're running out of hope
Out of hope, out of hope, out of hope

[Chorus]
So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes

[Bridge]
In the name of a broken spirit
Fight the boundaries and kill it
Trapped inside the villain of man
Apathy, the sickness in our lifespan

[Chorus]
So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes

13219,Crazy,From Ashes to New,"[Intro: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me

[Verse 1: Danny Case & Matt Brandyberry]
I give, you take, you always push me away
I love, you hate, it's always, always the same
You're always taking, taking, never giving back
To me, it's in the past, but tell me how you live with that
You always love to hate with every single breath
But since the disconnect, you see the life you wish you had
Yeah, you see the life you wish you had

[Chorus: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
'Cause I hate the way that you make me feel
Am I going crazy?

[Verse 2: Danny Case & Matt Brandyberry]
I can't, I won't, won't bend until I break
I do, you don't, it's always, always the same
All I wanted was for you to understand my mind
I'm over standing by your side, it isn't worth the time
All you wanted was to push me somewhere past the line
Push me somewhere out of sight, push me somewhere out of mind

[Chorus: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
'Cause I hate the way that you make me feel
Am I going crazy?

[Bridge: Danny Case]
Always the same
Always the same
Always the same

Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me

Going crazy?
Yeah, I'm going crazy

Life is fleeting by the slow
It chills us to the wave
And feeds me to the bone

With every battle, we lose a little more
Remember everything that we'd die for

13218,Ghost,Badflower,"[Verse 1]
I tried it once before but I didn't get too far
I felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart
And all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
But I waited there forever and nobody even looked up
I tried it once before and I think I might've messed up
I struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough
But maybe I'm alive 'cause I didn't really wanna die
But nothing very special ever happens in my life

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be

[Verse 2]
I tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut
I thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough
And I should've told my mother, ""Mom, I love you,"" like a good son
But this life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be, yeah

[Bridge]
I tried it once again and I think I might black out
I should've left a letter but I had nothing to write about
My blood is all around me, I get dizzy if I stand up
The cutting part was easy but regretting it is so fucked

[Chorus]
Yeah, take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be
I tried it once again and I think I went too far
(The man that I was meant to be)
I cut a little deeper and the pressure stopped my heart
(The man that I was meant to be)
I couldn't tell my mother that I love her, I'm a bad son
This life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one

How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you
This happened to you

It's just a problem that I'm faced with; am I
Not the only one who hates to stand by?
Complications that are first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind
Knowing endless consequences

Get back, step back, and as for me
I can't believe

Get psycho
I wanna get psycho
Get psycho
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna

Wanna get psycho
Run, you little bitch
I want your power glowing, juicy, flowing, red hot
Meaning of life
It's not enough to have a little taste
I want the whole damn thing
Now, can you dig it?
Need to get psycho
I want to hear you say it
Say you want it, need it
Don't wanna wait until we finish the show
It's not enough; you hunger for more
You're one twisted little fuck
And now you wanna get psycho with me

Give in, give in, decide
Give in, give in, give in, decide
Give in, give in, give in, DECIDE

I want the whole damn thing
Now, can you dig it?
Need to get psycho

Tell me to take you, scare you, fuck you
After we finish the show
It's not enough
You listening, whore?

[Bridge]
I can feel the blood flowing through my veins
Spilling on my soul
And now the hunger's getting bigger
Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
And pull my trigger
Free the violence that is building in me
I say now, end of the ride, murder-suicide
Is how I've been feeling lately

Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
I'm reeling with the feeling that I
Can't ignore
Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
I'm reeling with the feeling that I
Can't ignore

Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
I'm reeling with the feeling that I
Can't ignore
And the need to get psycho
Is not a question to me

13270,Monster,Skillet,"[Verse 1]
The secret side of me
I never let you see
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
So stay away from me
The beast is ugly
I feel the rage, and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls
In the closet, in the halls
It comes awake, and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed
In my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end!

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I hate what I've become!
The nightmare's just begun!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!

[Verse 2]
My secret side I keep
Hid under lock and key
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out
He'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end!

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I hate what I've become!
The nightmare's just begun!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!

[Bridge]
It's hiding in the dark!
Its teeth are razor-sharp!
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream
Maybe it's just a dream
Maybe it's inside of me
Stop this monster!
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster

[Chorus]
I hate what I've become!
The nightmare's just begun!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I‚Äôm gonna lose control!
It‚Äôs something radical!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!

You don't know that I know
You watch me every night
And I just can't resist the urge
Just to stand here in the light
Your greedy eyes upon me
And then I come undone
And I could close the curtain
But this is too much fun

[Chorus]
I get off on you
Getting off on me
Give you what you want
But nothing is for free
It's a give and take
Kind of love we make
When the line is crossed
I get off
I get off

[Verse 2]
There's so much left unspoken
Between the two of us
It's so much more exciting
To look when you can't touch
You could say I'm different
And maybe I'm a freak
But I know how to twist you
To bring you to your knees

[Chorus]
I get off on you
Getting off on me
Give you what you want
But nothing is for free

Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid

[Chorus]
I'm feeling invincible tonight
Take your time
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
Invincible
Invincible

If you're like us, calling all riders
Roll up beside us, no place to hide us

13277,You're Going Down,Sick Puppies,"[Verse 1]
Define your meanin' of war
To me it's what we do when we're bored
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more
Because I'm hyped up, out of control
If it's a fight, I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I know that I know

[Chorus]
It's been a long time comin'
And the tables turned around
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down

[Verse 2]
Define your meanin' of fun
Is it fuckin', druggin' or guns?
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one
Let's take a trip down memory lane
The words circlin' in my brain
You can treat this like another all the same
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

[Chorus]
It's been a long time comin'
And the tables turned around
'Cause one of us is going
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down

[Bridge]
This is hardly worth fightin' for
But it's the little petty shit that I can't ignore
When my fist hits your face and your face hits the floor
It'll be a long time comin'
But you got the message now
'Cause I was never goin'
Yeah, you're the one that's goin' down

[Outro]
One of us is goin' down
I'm not running
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is going dow'

Go hard or go home is the motto this year

13281,Under The Knife,Rise Against,"[Verse 1]
Wake me up inside
Tell me there's a reason
To take another step
To get up off my knees and
Follow this path of most resistance
And wherever it takes us
Whatever it faces and wherever it leads

[Chorus]
So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside

[Verse 2]
Something for the pain, just to kill this feeling
Although we look awake, inside we're all still sleeping
I've spent my time here alive, but barely there
Do you believe we'll ever make it?
Do you think we'll ever really see?

[Chorus]
So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside

[Bridge]
Wake me up inside
These dreams all die if we let them
Wake me up inside
Today won't start if we just give in
(Cause you'll be anything)

Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside

13251,Black Is The Soul,Korn,"[Verse 1]
As it all falls down
Do I walk away?
Or do l stand my ground
And accept my fate?

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing

[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

[Verse 2]
Happiness is found
In the darkest ways
And as I search around
I knew nothing but mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing

[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

[Bridge]
And when you scream
You push me so much further ahead
And when I leave
I always walk right back again
And when you cry
The tears are cleansing bitterness
I'm out of time
I'm slowly dying, give me back my life!
Just give me back my life!
Just give me back my life!
Just give me back my lies!

[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

As it all falls down
Do I walk away?
Or do I stand my ground

13285,Do You Call My Name,Ra,"(Kill me with a beat)

[Verse 1]
Some people seem to think
They always know what's best for you
Their little minds try to
Create a world to keep you still
The bolt is thrown, the cage is locked
You saw this, don't you lie
At first you cry and then
You hate those people, stole your will

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(No nothing)

[Chorus]
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

[Verse 2]
So you just sit there stuck
Afraid to risk reality
Afraid to cause yourself
More pain to face insanity
But nothing ventured, nothing gained
You see your fear's your cage
You beg for help but
You're alone stuck in a helpless rage

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario

[Bridge]
It's me...
I see...
Please...
(Let me out, I'm petrified)

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(C'mon)

[Chorus]
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

Darkening skies, coming this way
Falling behind, into nothing

But if you lead, I will follow
A thousand miles away
I will be your Apollo
Alone in outer space

Satellite, shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity
I will stay and never leave
My satellite, are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me

Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me

[Bridge]
Far across the emptiness I walk the night
And search the silence in the dark you left behind
I seek the stars above the worlds to be the guides
But they all pale against the light in your eyes
In your eyes
And I won't suppose to know why you walked away
But I can feel you pushing through beyond the space
So send your energy to me and I'll push through
Send your signal home and bring me back to you

[Chorus]
Satellite, shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity
I will stay and never leave
My satellite, are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me
Shine on me

13297,96 Quite Bitter Beings,CKY,"[Verse 1]
With my perceptions in a mix down twenty miles through the sticks
To the cloudy town of Hellview: Population 96
Excessive vacancy, well maybe, in the shadow of an eye
All the strangers passing through and where the rules just don't apply

[Verse 2]
At the fork turn left, a store, but on the right stay free from sight
Cause 96 quite bitter beings like to stack the bodies high
The only way to ever leave is overflooded by the storm
And entanglement in Hellview brings you fear in fifty forms
They've deleted all the tourists at the bottom of the lake
And not one supports the cause to leave the blood stay in the veins

[Hook 1]
Here, three miles back is where we are
All we ever wanted was an answer
Civilized are close but way too far
All we ever wanted was an answer

[Hook 2]
Footprints giving clue to where we are
All we ever wanted was an answer
Civilized are close but way too far
All we ever wanted...

13252,Song #3,Stone Sour,"[Verse 1]
If you take a step towards me
You will take my breath away
So, I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe
No one else has ever loved me
No one else has ever tried
I never understood how much I could take

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I saw the worst was over
When I laid my eyes on you
It was all that I could do to know my place
Out of all the past illusions
Out of all the dreams come true
I was gone until I finally saw your face

[Chorus]
And if you cried out for more...
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me, too

[Verse 2]
Let me take a step towards you
Let me feel you in my hands
Let me cross this line and show you where it leads
There's a darkness down inside me
That I know we'll both enjoy
And it's screaming from within to set it free

[Pre-Chorus]
I have left this bloody nightmare
In my wake but out of sight
All I want is deviation by design
Out of all the past confusion
Out of all the common spite
Just tell me I am yours, 'cause you are mine

[Chorus]
And if you cried out for more...
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me, too

[Bridge]
It doesn't really matter what you do or say
I'm never goin' anywhere anyway
'Cause when I'm dyin' for you
I've never felt so alive

[Chorus]
And if you cried out for more...
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me, too

[Outro]
I know you saved me, too

It's like a heart attack, I see the shock when you face it
We couldn't take it so we got a little wasted
I'd really love to see the look on their face
When you open your eyes, when you open your eyes

You run away, then who's gonna save us?

Came to get it started, came to get right

I mean what I speak, I do as I say
I hustle, I grind, don't get in my way
I'm pimping my hoes, I'm checking my foes
As I spit at police and duck my P.O.'s
I ain't going to court, you can call a judge
Tell him kiss my ass 'cause I ain't gon' budge
And I ain't going back to lock up
You try and the Glock'll pop up
I ain't going back to broke

Expect attention unfamiliar with being ignored

They gon' see you on the hot damn news
And I ain‚Äôt leaving nothin linking me to the crime

Beating these niggas down is what I came to do
And I ain't playing by a hot damn rule
Shaking you niggas down if you ain't paying your dues

Don't call my hands 'cause you gon' make me act a hot damn fool

Remember me for all time, this
Determination is a vital part of me
Surrender now, or be counted
With the endless masses that I will defeat

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on, bring it
Don't sing it
Better believe it
Broken down till your hope has died
Beat down till the victory's mine
Stand up and show me some pride
And now, are you ready?

[Chorus]
I'm one with the warrior inside
My dominance can't be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield tonight
As I look upon you
Through the warrior's eyes now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory this time

[Verse 2]
I can't be told to compromise this
They'll never doubt the body lying at my feet
A most formidable reminder
They will speak my name for eternity
I have no need of any guidance
I am a weapon, powerful beyond belief
Seen through the warrior's eyes
I never need to question how to defeat you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on, bring it
Don't sing it
Better believe it
Broken down till your hope has died
Beat down till the victory's mine
Stand up and show me some pride
And now, are you ready?

[Chorus]
I'm one with the warrior inside
My dominance can't be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield tonight
As I look upon you
Through the warrior's eyes now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory this time

[Bridge]
You can't hide now
I am the warrior
So decide now
How they‚Äôll remember you
Do not hide now
Act like a warrior
Show your pride now
Solidify your place in time

[Chorus]
I'm one with the warrior inside
My dominance can't be denied
Your entire world will turn
Into a battlefield tonight
As I look upon you
Through the warrior's eyes now
I can see the fear that will
Ensure my victory this time

[Outro]
I'm one with the warrior inside
The evidence can't be denied
The entire world will stare
Into this battlefield tonight
As I stand before you
With a warrior's heart now
I can feel the strength that will
Ensure my victory this time

13253,The Violence,Rise Against,"[Verse 1]
Dancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or was it all a dream?

The bombs are getting closer everyday
""That can never happen here"" we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or was it all a dream?

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough or is it all a dream?

[Verse 2]
To a predetermined fate, are we condemned?
Or maybe we're a book without an end?
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control
And this is not a dream

So can we break this mold?
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away!

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough?

[Bridge]
Well trodden paths are all we take
We need a storm; let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from the shadows
And into the light

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Are we not good, good enough?
Or was it all a dream...

Come crashing to the floor
And I know there must be more like me
I've seen this all before, I can't carry this anymore
Break free
Breathe, and leave, until the storm is over
Cause underneath, there's a diamond passing over
So breathe, let's leave, until the storm is over
Because I want to take you away

Move, and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do
And move, when you just can't take it
And move, if you just feel like breaking it
Move, and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do
And move, when you just can't take it
And move, if you just feel like breaking it
Move, and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do
And move, when you just can't take it

I clear my mind, no second guessing
I'm 'bout to teach all of my critics a lesson
Class is in session, here comes the truth
Don't you know this is the one thing I was born to do?

You know I bleed it; I'm 'bout to own it
And there ain't no chance this is slipping away
'Cause right here, right now this is judgment day

I am fearless to the bone
I'm a fighter, a soldier
Turn my desire into gold

Now I'm staring down the barrel of a gun
Take my shot while I'm young
I can taste it on the tip of my tongue
You know I eat it, breath it, and I believe it
And when I lay my head down I even dream it
I taught my mind how to push through the pain
Can't stop, no way
This shit is in my DNA
False prophets preach that I'm not good enough
They try and knock me down, but I get right back up

Face everything and rise

The streets crawl with a deadly omen
Outside, I see a world that's broken
I can't breathe, my heart is chokin'
I need a cure for this life I've chosen

My pain is a blessing in disguise
I feel it cutting, and it's cutting like a knife
My pain, my pain is a blessing in disguise

Angels keep falling from the sky

Throw me in the fire
But I'll never be the same
I come alive when I am

I'm under fire
When I'm burning wide awake
I am protected when I'm
Walking through the flames
W-w-w-walking through the flames
W-w-w-walking through the flames

I will face everything and rise
Never gonna quit until I die
Angels keep falling from the sky
I'll take your broken wings and learn to fly
I will face everything and rise

Face everything and rise
The pain, the pain is a blessing in disguise

A policeman knew my name
He said, ‚ÄúYou can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away‚Äù
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

Eleven hours in the Tin Pan

Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan

Sending this out to the house that we built at the dead end of the street

Kick it!

This shit bumps, this shit fucks
This shit dumps like a dumptruck
This shit bumps, this shit fucks
This shit dumps like a dumptruck
(Dumptruck)

Are you with me?
Like an eagle with a molotov in it's break
Are you with me?
Now we're doing whatever the fuck we please

'Cause this shit bumps, this shit fucks
This shit dumps like a dumptruck
This shit bumps, this shit fucks
So here it comes, stick out your tongue
Take the ride, feel the rush
We're flying high, so come with us
Get off the bus, get in the truck
Get in the truck 'cause this shit fucks

This shit bumps, this shit fucks
This shit dumps like a dumptruck
This shit bumps, this shit fucks
This shit dumps like a dumptruck

This is ""Under Pressure""

[Applause]

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da
That's okay

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
De Dap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
High, Higher, High

[Bridge]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why?
Why?
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

[Applause]

13309,Heads Will Roll,Teamheadkick,"[Verse 1]
Step into the Battlefield, ready for war
I'm comin' ready to kill because I've been here before
Fill your face up, with the front of my shottie
That's what you get for talkin' shit when we sat in the lobby, bitch
All I hear is crying little squeakers
First I'll wreck your ass, then turn down the speakers
Face down in the mud, dialing the zoom
I pull the trigger (blah), send your head to the moon
It's you and me, and there's no one around
You wanna One V One me, come and get some, you're going down
Never making a sound (shh), we walk without noise
Noobs are getting rekt by all of my boys
Steady grabbin' ammo, staying low, being camo
I'm so gangster with the guns, it's like I'm Tony Soprano

[Chorus]
I stay low on the Battlefield, when your team walks by, you're getting killed
Now it's time to say goodbye
Heads will roll on the Battlefield, won't quit, won't stop, we never yield
Here we come, you're going to die

[Verse 2]
Battle of attrition, got the mission on my mind
Better watch your six, cause we're sneaking up behind
Take your whole crew out, with my team on my back
Every class, every weapon, everybody is stacked
On any map or location, anywhere you could run
I'm gonna get you in my sights, take the shot and you're done
Tossing out the nades, while you try to avoid
But as we infiltrate your base, you're getting destroyed
You're out of luck, your KDR sucks
Put the RPG in front of me, and hit you like a truck
Steady aimin' as I'm flankin', then I'm pullin' out the pistol
And they never see me comin' till I hit em like a missile
Steady droppin' noobs, and heavyweights too
When the SMG's are hummin' better watch your back, dude

[Chorus]
I stay low on the Battlefield, when your team walks by, you're getting killed
Now it's time to say goodbye
Heads will roll on the Battlefield, won't quit, won't stop, we never yield
Here we come, you're going to die

[Verse 3]
I need some help, cause I'm getting surrounded
It's like I'm in jail, cause my ass is getting pounded
I make the call, as I duck and I hide
And when my crew shows up, everyone of you dies
Everyone that I know is an FPS beast
Everyone understands that teamwork is key
Everyone looks out for the bros on the team
Everyone on my crew only knows victory

[Bridge]
Hardline, let's go, on the Battlefield it's time to roll
Put your guns up, get sum, rest in peace, cause now you're done
Hardline, let's go, on the Battlefield it's time to roll
Put your guns up, get sum, rest in peace, cause now you're done

[Chorus]
I stay low on the Battlefield, when your team walks by, you're getting killed
Now it's time to say goodbye
Heads will roll on the Battlefield, won't quit, won't stop, we never yield
Here we come, you're going to die

13321,Chaos And Earthquakes,Nonpoint,"[Verse 1]
Black operations usin' money colored black
Dark webs gettin' spun, so politically correct
Watchin' everybody fight each other
Sister versus brother
Peace versus war
Rich against the poor
Different versus different
Bed versus the floor
Wall versus the door
Shore black, water black, money black
Money-backin' greed back in season
Spring fall in summertime for unnatural reasons

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Wanna decide which side? You're a goner
Don't know which evil side is upon us this time
Mind your business. Stay in line
Find your calling. Enterprise

[Chorus]
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

[Verse 2]
This is maniacal, entire societies are fallin'
Without a net underneath ‚Äòem and no one digging ‚Äòem out
The fire has gotten out of control
We got no water, no buckets, and we‚Äôre lucky if tomorrow comes
""Why"" isn't important anymore
Sure, I'd like to know that need-to-know information
But when I know it
What reactions will it cause
When they finally show up dressed up, amped up in a black car?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wanna decide which side? You're a goner
Don't know which evil side is upon us this time
Mind your business. Stay in line
Find your glory, enterprise

Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes

Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes

Cuttin' away all the red tape, cuttin' away all the red tape
Of chaos and earthquakes

13310,Turn It Up,Sonic Syndicate,"[Intro]
Turning up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
What the fuck you gonna do?
(Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do...)

[Verse 1]
Your body's swaying from side to side
I want to catch you when you fall
But then you'll have learnt nothing at all
Still, I'm ready to run
But you're so damn drunk
An atomic bomb couldn't wake you up

What's that you hear?
Bass and lights from the club?
I don't think so; I'm by your side
And all I hear is ambulance siren cries
Screaming, ""Help me
Help me, help me, help me""

[Pre-Chorus]
But the way that you looked

[Chorus]
Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
What the fuck you gonna do?
Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken nails and a bleeding soul
Suck it up, you fuckin' ho!

[Post-Chorus]
The way she walks, the way she talks
We all know the girl is halfway dead, dead, dead

[Verse 2]
You're selling your soul for whiskey and Coke
And you're a suicide for tequila and lime
And I got to admit
When I first saw you hit the dance floor
With your grind
You sent me out of my mind

But after watching you crawl
In the door at 5:00 AM
It's getting old
Out of soul, out of dough, out of all
But you're screaming, ""I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care! I don't care!""

[Pre-Chorus]
But the way that she looked

[Chorus]
Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
What the fuck you gonna do?
Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken nails and a bleeding soul
Suck it up, you fuckin' ho!

Turn it up like you always do
(The way she walks, the way she talks)
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
(We all know the girl is halfway dead)
What the fuck you gonna do?
Turn it up like you always do
(The things she does, the things she says)
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken nails and a bleeding soul
(We all know the girl is halfway dead)
Suck it up, you fuckin' ho!

Dead, dead, halfway dead
Dead, dead, halfway dead

Not seen you lately, I'm wondering on
White roses, caskets, your name on a stone
Turning up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos

Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose

Suck it up, you fuckin' ho!

I've been there before
Your feeling your fears and doubts come down on you
When it rains, it pours
In over your head to know where you're headed to

[Refrain 1]
I was stuck on windin' roads
No dead end signs, nowhere to go
Hopin' someone catch me if I fall
I've woken up and been in daze
Can't seem to wanna show my face to
Anything or anyone at all

[Pre-Chorus]
So, when you're feelin' small, I hope you know
Goliath the ground with just one stone
And tell me there is a lifeboat
But if you call on me‚Ä¶

I can be your hero, oh-oh, hero, oh-oh
I can be your hero
I can be your hero, oh-oh, hero, oh-oh
I can be your hero

When you start to dread
That you might be alone and you're stuck with your own advice
Or that your only friend
I'm not anymore 'cause you got me to stand the behind

So, if you see inside a wave
I'll be able to help you be brave
I'll stand with you [?]

13312,Beating Heart,Steal The City,"It's time to turn this around
Once turned my life upside down
Now it's burning through my conscience
Sleepless nights come back around
Selfish thoughts in my mind, selfless actions are my downfall

I cannot waste my precious time
How many times can I cross the line?
Won't confess rain or shine
Such a mess but I'll be fine
After everything you put me through..

Give it up, give it up
It is my time to fight
It is my human right
To make sure I don't fade away
Money isn't everything it claims to be
I just wanna be free
From everything that's bringing me down

I'm not losing my mind
I thought it was over
But god only knows i was wrong
Seen better days time goes to show
I'm not waiting around
But you know it won't be long

I cannot waste my precious time
It is my time to let it shine
Not afraid to protest
I'll be at my best
Such a shame I'm still hung up on you

Give it up, give it up
It is my time to fight
It is my human right
To make sure I don't fade away
Money isn't everything it claims to be
I just wanna be free
From everything that's bringing me down

I didn't know that this day would be the end of me
I didn't know that the pain would feel so sharp
You wouldn't know if I ever made it this far
Still goes to show I still have a beating heart

Give it up, give it up
It is my time to fight
It is my human right
To make sure I don't fade away
Money isn't everything it claims to be
I just wanna be free
From everything that's bringing me down

Cannot clear my head

But my faithfulness is drowning
The only good's that left is fading from my memory

You will pay for everything you fucking did to me

Nothing changes

The main attraction of this twisted master plan

Sleep with one eye open, not to be their prey
Fist against my face, they bring me to my knees
Pressure's crushing down so hard, I can't break free

The hunger for revenge gives me strength to stand

Living in a perfect and controlled project
A puppet of their sick perversion's appetite
Will I be trapped inside this hell until I die?

I give my bleeding heart out for one reason

I'm not gonna carry no heavy load

I was brought up on the Bible
Fear of God and the devil too
By whiskey drinkers, heavy smokers
""Do as I say, child, not as I do""

We were gypsies born from gambling
""Pack your bag or pay the rent""
So we blew 'round, around that whole town
Like feathers in the wind

And we'll let it slide, gonna let it flow
I'm not gonna worry anymore
I'm gon' kick this rock on down the road
I'm not gonna carry no heavy load

There was trouble, there was heartbreak
Things a child could not control
When the feeling as it first wake
Wasn't aching in your soul

I have parted the curtains
Let the sun come streaming
Shift the rain from my hair
I have carried a burden
And no one can see it
And it's time to leave it there

Every evening I go riding
In my yellow pick-up truck
For the freedom and the night will
Turn my sorrow into luck

I'm gonna let it slide, I'm gonna let it flow
I'm not gonna worry anymore
I'm gon' kick this rock on down the road
I'm not gonna carry no heavy load

'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
I don't understand what you want from me

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm spinning out of control
Try to focus but everything's twisted
And all along I thought you would be there
To let me know I'm not alone
But in fact that's exactly what I was

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
Or all of the things you've said to me

[Bridge]
I may never know the answer
To this endless mystery
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me

[Interlude]
Is it a mystery? Is it a mystery?
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

Spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control

Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
Or all the things you've said to me

[Outro]
And I may never know the answer
To this endless mystery
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

Who do I turn to? And what do I do?
I'm looking for answers, the lies and the truth
I thought I knew better, but I don't know shit
It's gotta be out there, something better than this

[Chorus]
I'm caught in the middle of life
Somewhere in the middle of love
Nothing's gonna change till I break these chains
And I tear down the wall
I‚Äôm lost in the middle of life
Stuck in the middle of love
Nothing‚Äôs gonna change til I break these chains
And I tear down the wall

[Verse 2]
What is the meaning and where does it end?
What does it matter until it begins?
I can't go backwards, I can't give in
Feels like the future is dying and the past is dead

[Chorus]
I'm caught in the middle of life
Somewhere in the middle of love
Nothing's gonna change till I break these chains
And I tear down the wall
I‚Äôm lost in the middle of life
Stuck in the middle of love
Nothing‚Äôs gonna change til I break these chains
And I tear down the wall

Brick by brick
Brick by brick
Brick by brick
Brick by brick
Tear it down with me
Tear it down with me now!
Go!

Somewhere in the middle of love
Nothing's gonna change till I break these chains
And I tear down the wall

I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock 'n' roll
Sometimes, it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough
I keep saying that it's getting too much
But I know I'm a liar
Feeling alright in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire

Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you

Walking out on another stage
Another town, another place
Sometimes, I don't feel right
Nerves wound up too damn tight

Don't you tell me
That it's bad for my health
'Cause kicking back don't make it
Out of control, I play the ultimate role
Don't know how to fake it

Every time I'm with it alone
It picks me up
You just send me down
I can feel it rushing under my skin
You're a cage won't you let me in?
On my toes
Lock the door
Pretty face
Through the walls
Don't know if I'd be so sure again

[Chorus]
My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out

[Verse 2]
Every time I'm stuck in the ground
Spin me round, won't you spin me round
You're a void, a crack in the mirror
See me now, if you could see me now
You slipped through
The night
Then walked out
Skin tight
But you don't matter that much to me
No you don't matter that much to me

[Chorus]
My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out
So turn the lights out
Just turn the lights out

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

I hitched a ride until the coast
To leave behind all of my ghosts
Searching for something I couldn't find at home

[Verse 2]
Can't get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit and I'll be fine
I swear to God, this'll be my one last time

They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

When it gets dark in Pigeon Park
Voice in my head will soon be fed
By the vultures, that circle round the dead

They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves

I'd ever be caught
Staring at sidewalks
Hiding my track marks
I left my best friends
Or did they just leave me?

They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves

Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves

Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you

13341,The Number Of The Beast,Iron Maiden,"[Intro: Barry Clayton]
Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty-six

[Verse 1]
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cos in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Night was black, was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?

[Chorus]
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

[Verse 3]
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

[Chorus]
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes

[Chorus]
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Six-six-six, the one for you and me

[Outro]
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold
Lost my hold to the shadows of the night

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark

[Verse 2]
Do your demons
Do they ever let you go?
When you try do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I we're words without a rhyme

And you'll hear it calling you, beware
Look out!

Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets, now orphans of war
Bodies hangin' in the streets to adore

Royal flames will carve a path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night
Death is riding into town with armor

Born again, but it‚Äôs too late to atone

Arrows black out all the light
Death is riding into town with armor

The final falling
I'll never rest until
I can make my own way

It's my time to dream (It's my time to dream)
Dream of the skies (Dream of the skies)

Isn't plagued by the poison in me
And help me decide if my fire will burn out
Before you can breathe
Breathe into me

13381,Duality,Slipknot,"[Intro]
I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside
If the pain goes on‚Ä¶ A-a-a-ah!

[Verse 1]
I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create

[Verse 2]
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

[Chorus]
I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

[Verse 3]
Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chi, chi-chi
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like I've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooh, your face is a mess
Ooh, ooh, so how could they know?
Ah, ah, how could they know?

Those same friends tell me your every word

It's snowing outside, the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky

[Hook]
The blizzard goes on, but still, they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare

[Verse 2]
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow

Into the night, they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare

[Verse 3]
They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb

[Hook]
They make their way, but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day

[Verse 4]
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the Eagle's Nest

[Hook]
They dared to go where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare

And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Of a good friend

Please stay!

Years before they took away the part of me that cared

13361,Long Way Back From Hell,Danzig,"[Verse 1]
Sold into slavery down in New Orleans
Goddess of the bayou light
Black dog's head on the killing bed
Severed and left to bleed
There on fire in the corner of the world
There in misery
There on fire in the corner of the world
Left for God to see

[Chorus]
Do you want to take a life?
Do you want to cross that line?
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me

Poison father of the human race
God of the tainted blood
Malevolence sneaking up the spine of the world
Ready for the bastard son
There on fire in the veins of man
There in misery
There on fire in the veins of man
Left for God to see

Do you want to take a life?
Do you want to cross that line?
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me

Left for God to see

Do you want to take a life?
Do you want to cross that line?
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me

13377,The Vengeful One,Disturbed,"[Verse 1]
He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation, I cannot forget

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

[Verse 2]
As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

[Bridge]
When you die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die, you'll know why
You'll die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die, you'll know why

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one

In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?

So I'm cutting that branch off the cherry tree
Singing, ""This will be my victory,""
Then I see them coming after me
And they're following me across the sea

And I don't know why this is happening
But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need

13396,Open Your Eyes,Disturbed,"[Verse 1]
You're paralyzed, breathe your disguise
You feed on the lies that they tell you
Got to break away from the numbing pain
Succumb to the rage that's inside you

You're hypnotized (Hypnotized), demoralized
Believe every line that they sell you
Start channeling (Channeling), whatever will remains
Discern from what's fiction and what is true

You've lost your sense from the emptiness
You do as the headlines compel you
Become whole again and let the war begin
Destroy the veneer that surrounds you

There's no defense (No defense) for your recklessness
You stare as the proof lies before you
Why can't you see (Can't you see)
Are you afraid to be exposed to the demons around you?

I wish I knew what it was like
To care enough to carry on

That you can't just live your motherfuckin' life?
The story's gettin' old and my heart is gettin' colder
I just wanna be Jekyll, but I'm always fuckin' Hyde

[Verse 4]
You got rocks in your head, I can hear them rollin' 'round
You can say that you're above it, but you're always fallin' down
Is there a method to your madness? Is it all about pride?
Seems everyone I know, they got a demon inside

[Chorus]
(Oh, yo, yo) There's a demon inside
(Oh, yo, yo) Just like Jekyll and Hyde
(Oh, yo, yo) All this anger inside
(Oh, yo, yo) I feel like Jekyll and Hyde

[Bridge]
If I wasn't so deranged
Could I ever face the pain?
If I ever were to change
Would the song remain the same?

(Oh, yo, yo)
All I'm tryin' to do is live my motherfuckin' life
(Oh, yo, yo)
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside
(Oh, yo, yo)
All I'm tryin' to do is live my motherfuckin' life
(Oh, yo, yo)
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

(Oh, yo, yo) There's a demon inside
(Oh, yo, yo) Just like Jekyll and Hyde
(Oh, yo, yo) All this anger inside

Ah, ah, ah, aw

[Verse 1]
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention

[Chorus]
The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope
And we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

[Interlude]
Ah, ah, ah, aw

[Verse 2]
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless

[Chorus]
The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope
And we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

Now Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders From Mars
He played it left hand, but made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man, well-hung and snow-white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass, he was the nazz
With God-given ass, he took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh yeah
Ooh

I make my way up

Putting on my mask of despair

While I'm exposed to the thin air

I'm neither dead nor alive

All we do is climbing mountain after mountain
In search for greater heights (in search for greater lives)
Born deceived, hopes are high
But all we leave are footprints in the white

Are footprints in the white
Are footprints in the white

As I reach the top of the world
I see it laying in front of me
Was it worth the struggle
Or I'm just wither away

I'm neither dead nor alive
I am the lone wolf

In search for greater heights (in search for greater lives)
Born deceived, hopes are high

We don't need to give and take
Evaporate or let me end the drought
We can swim and ride the wave
Swim and ride the wave
We could take a day off

[Verse 2]
Walk into the room like you need answers
When it don't matter what you think you'll find
Set your phone aside so we could get lost
In things that don't cost a penny of your time

Don't tell me that you're satisfied

[Chorus]
If you ever need a break
If you ever need to settle down
We can swim into a daze
I promise that you're never gonna drown
We don't need to give and take
Evaporate or let me end the drought
We can swim and ride the wave
Swim and ride the wave
We could take a day off

[Bridge]
We could take a day off
We could take a day off
Swim and ride the wave
We could take the day off
If you want to
We could take the day off
Swim and ride the wave
Swim and ride the wave

[Chorus]
If you ever need a break
If you ever need to settle down
We can swim into a daze
I promise that you're never gonna drown
We don't need to give and take
Evaporate or let me end the drought
We can swim and ride the wave
Swim and ride the wave
We could take a day off

And we could take a day off

13413,Angels Fall,Breaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
I try to face the fight within
But it's over
I'm ready for the riot to begin
And surrender
I walked the path that led me to the end
Remember
I'm caught beneath with nothing left to give, forever

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever

[Verse 2]
Gray skies will chase the light away
No longer
I fought the fight, now only dark remains
Forever
Divided, I will stand
And I will let this end

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever

[Bridge]
The sun begins to rise
And wash away the sky
The turning of the tide
Don't leave it all behind
And I will never say goodbye

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever

I hate feeling like this

Day after day
I dig farther down this hole
That I have made
And I don't know
I don't know

If each fist-full I take
Brings me closer to my goal or to a grave

[Chorus]
I'm in
The black hole you left me in
Digging
To try to leave you behind

The black hole you left me in
Trying
To get you out of my mind
Before I bury myself alive

I am the prey
Swimming circles in a fishbowl on display
And I'm stuck here
Always in a
Struggle to breathe
Under an avalanche that won't stop falling

The black hole you left me in
Digging
To try to leave you behind
I'm in
The black hole you left me in

Does this hole
Lead straight to hell?
'Cause I'm falling
And all I know
Is lost under

A black hole
You left me in
Digging
To try to leave you behind
I'm in
The black hole you left me in
Trying
To get you out of my mind

Head to higher ground while there's a chance to live

Oh, lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh, lord, oh, lord

[Verse 1: Elias Soriano]
Well, if you told me you were drownin'
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
When I was there and saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off the grin
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh, lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh, lord

I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show
But the pain still grows
No stranger to you or me

And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life

13401,Absolute Zero,Stone Sour,"[Verse 1]
The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot; I can show you the truth
And I don't need a reason to lie to you
No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
If you don't have a weapon, you can't have mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life... it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

[Verse 2]
The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your prima donnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react; it's as simple as that
It's better just to settle than face the facts

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life... it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

[Bridge]
One thing that I can't stand
Is when the minutes fight the second hand
I'll waste a lifetime's worth
Just to cling to one more day

[Verse 3]
No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
Man is a four-letter word, it's really absurd
The hate isn't fake; it's just inferred

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
I'm down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
Oh, I'm not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

You're a liar,‚ÄÖyou‚ÄÖlied to me
You‚ÄÖcan try to deny it, but‚ÄÖnow I can see

[Verse 1]
This has been a long time coming
Remember that I fucking loved you
When you said that I was nothing?
I kept your picture in my wallet
Showed you off to everyone
But little did I know the person you'd become

[Refrain]
All my friends had told me I should stay away
But I never paid attention to the words they would say
You're crying after lies, but I never gave up
Now I've paid for my mistakes
My momma told me you were bad for me
You were a disasterpiece
Don't you remember Billie Jean?
She says that I am the one
(Hee-hee-hee, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
You're a liar, you lied to me (To me)
You can try to deny it, but now I can see
You're a liar, you lied to me

'Cause you fucked it up after all
'Cause you fucked it up after all

Is it the same with him? (Same with him)
I think about you all the time
I'm running outta words that rhyme (That rhyme)
I see you on the streets (The streets)
Do you feel incomplete? (Incomplete)
But I remember the time, you
When you told me

[Refrain]
You were going out with some friends
And that you'd be home by ten
""Don't worry about them other boys
Because they don't mean a thing""
I know you're not alone, so I hit your cell phone
But you won't pick up now, all I get is dial tone
I know you were with another guy, I can see it in your eyes
Your friends, they told me it just became my time to leave

[Bridge]
(Stay away)
You tried to take control of me
You never thought that I could leave
(It's too late, oh no)
I just don't see you the same
Do you consider how
You made me broken, bitter now?
Take your shit, leave me alone
This is no longer a home
You ruined me, this is what you do to me
Flowers for the dead
Say goodbye and turn my head
(You're a liar, you lied to me, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
You're a liar, you lied to me (To me)
You can try to deny it, but now I can see
You're a liar, you lied to me
If you ever question why we had to fall
'Cause you fucked it up after all (After all)
'Cause you fucked it up after all (After all)
'Cause you fucked it up after all (Oh, oh no)
'Cause you fucked it up after all (After all)
'Cause you fucked it up after all

Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

The silence is what kills me
I need someone here to help me
But you don't know how to listen
And let me make my decisions

I sit here, locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

All your insults and your curses
Make me feel like I'm not a person

But you made me, so do something!
'Cause I'm fucked up, because you all
Need attention, attention you couldn't give!

From cigarettes to skinny jeans
You got the money, they got the means

Oh, you upper class daughters
And working class sons
It's hard to save a dollar
The way the world runs
You're the target market of a corporate joke
It won't be so ironic when your daddy is broke

You're much better looking when you're in disguise
Surprise, surprise! Surprise, surprise!
And this revolution has been brought to you by

Just find a style, so you can mimic
The tortured artist, the jaded cynic
The latest gadget is just a gimmick
Another sucker born every minute

Well I'm sick of this town bringing me down
A first world epidemic all around
I'm sick of this town bringing me down
A lost generation trying to act profound

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you upper class daughters
And working class sons
It's hard to save a dollar
The way the world runs
We got a counterculture you can buy off a shelf
If you're losing your identity, try somebody else

You're much better looking when you're in disguise

Call the ranks, call the ranks
Call the ranks, call the ranks
Call the ranks, call the ranks, call

We're the target market of a corporate hoax
Our generation is a fucking joke

13415,Love Crime,My Darkest Days,"Some say that love is blind
Some lovers live in lie
She meant the world to me
I've found my one and only

Felt no guilt inside
Can't tell the wrong from right
She stole my soul from me
Her heart is cold and empty
(Turn around and run away)

Get out alive
Before she goes and makes another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)
I paid the price
So she could go and make another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)

Her smile, you can't resist
There's poison on her lips
Disguised as an angel
One night could be fatal

Next victim on her list
Gets caught with just one kiss
You'll never see it coming
To her, love is nothing
(Turn around and run away)

Get out alive
Before she goes and makes another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)
I paid the price
So she could go and make another victim of the love crime

Turn around and run away
Turn around and run away

Get out alive
Before she goes and makes another victim of the love crime

And take the city up
She'll go and make another victim of the love crime

Worlds collide and hearts get broken
I want to live like I know I'm dying
Take up my cross, not be afraid

And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend your locket

Sells an empty promise
They build you up just to watch you fall
It‚Äôs time to meet this face to face

Everyone has been betrayed

What creates my own madness

And you're the master

13405,Throne,Bring Me The Horizon,"[Verse 1]
Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

[Verse 2]
The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive ya
You are the reason I still fight

Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know (Know)

13408,Savior,Rise Against,"[Intro]
It kills me not to know this, but I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face, that this world has forgotten

[Verse 1]
There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
‚ÄôCause I don't know

[Chorus]
That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!""
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

[Verse 2]
And the day pressed on like crushing weights, for no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
‚ÄôCause I don't know

That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!""

That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...

I don't hate you, no...

Switch who spits I think it‚Äôs Stitch like 626, it isn‚Äôt Doyle

I get it lit better change my coils

Kings like royals

Since we‚Äôre spoiled

Yup

Yup, yup

Spoiled with the ability to rap
I‚Äôma stick a tac on a city on a map
Hit ‚Äòem up and snap like a finisher attack

Tell me where they roll, I‚Äôma hit where they at
So much money, gotta fit it in a bag
Matt like a poodle that‚Äôs sitting on my lap
She gon‚Äô know the name when I hit it from the back

Going from a 1 to 10
No one even really gives a fuck who I am

That‚Äôs not true

I‚Äôma just go again, grabbing a feat. like I‚Äôm under the bed, I‚Äôm a monster
Or one‚Äôs stuck in my head

I‚Äôll take a shot, like a gun to defend
Nah, I‚Äôll take a shot, never rush for the net
‚ÄòCause I just don‚Äôt pretend I got money to spend

Just don‚Äôt pretend ‚Äòcause your money could

I‚Äôm deadin‚Äô them all but I opened the door
Fly lines, somebody pull my chord

Hey, can I go once more?

Of course

You sure? I like yours but I‚Äôm getting kinda bored in the background

*gasp* man, stand down, I am the one that you called when you needed a handout, I‚Äôm not a fan now

Wait, I ain‚Äôt looking to be starting shit
No arguments
So let‚Äôs aim where the target is
The audience and all my partnerships
Started from a hand shake like Parkinson‚Äôs

Y‚Äôall swim with the largest fish
Rippin‚Äô up your apartment quick
The carpet is covered up in carcasses
It‚Äôs hard to miss with mark with the sharpest pick

Wooh

Sick flow bro

Thanks, you too, yo the intro‚Äôs dope

Match up force with the back and forths
That I have endorsed like a quid pro quo

Wooh

What the kids don‚Äôt know

Is the kick‚Äôs so dope that the windows broke

And the crack of the snare leaves a crack in the mirror like a glass getting smashed when I hit those notes

Spitting in the kitchen cooking more than Gordon Ramsay
If it isn‚Äôt hitting then you salty or you have beef
Even out the seasons yo, I store em in the pantry
Maybe we can take it to recording on a rap beat

I ain‚Äôt really shocked ain‚Äôt nobody understand me
I could take the kitty from the bitty like a plan B
I be pullin‚Äô up with the white like a banshee
They don‚Äôt really like it in life when you happy

Okay I‚Äôm hearing you rapping
Let‚Äôs hear some lyrics with passion
I‚Äôm always scared of collapsing
Always so jealous of people who mention that their biggest fear is arachnids

‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm a Spider-Man but hyper than anyone that try the gang get sniped, they can hit you from a mile away, your life could end
You ain‚Äôt really gonna see the lights again

Like I‚Äôm whipping in a civic and I‚Äôm here to win a race
Might leave a bitter taste
I‚Äôm fresher than the ice that‚Äôs sitting in a little sip of lemonade
I‚Äôve seen some better days
I‚Äôve been a renegade
I‚Äôve spoken for the people who don‚Äôt ever get a say
If I‚Äôm sitting on a plane
Getting paid to entertain
Then I did it all just being me, anyways

They gonna claim they on the radio but they don‚Äôt want to play the song
Who would‚Äôve thought it would take this long?
Fire on the piggy like filet minion
Left as a youth and I came and gone
Hit me up quick, yo we can‚Äôt be long
Don‚Äôt be coming ‚Äòround where you ain‚Äôt be long
They gon‚Äô sing it loud on the day we gone
So what?

But you know what?
They‚Äôll explode when they know I'ma blow up
Take some notes so I don‚Äôt have to show ya
They want smoke, just roll up the doja

Wooh

Roll up the doja
I pull it out like a cobra
Taking a bite and it‚Äôs over
I put the kid in a coma
I do not need no exposure
I just would like a diploma
School of hard knocks and I‚Äôm rightfully owner
I am the life of the party, I‚Äôm getting retarded, I follow this Molly and soda
On my sorority shit

13481,Drive,Lockeland,"[Verse 1]
'65 baby blue Ford has got me
Truckin' down this cotton field road
Fast or slow, honey,‚ÄÖI‚ÄÖdon't care
As long‚ÄÖas I'm anywhere, anywhere with you
'Cause‚ÄÖall I wanna do is drive, drive, drive

[Verse 2]
Hit the brakes, baby jump in
No time to stop and we're gone again
Gravels flys, knocks the rust off the bed of my truck
We can ride this ride 'til the tough falls off
So come on let's get lost

[Chorus]
Lost in the way that you got me feelin'
Takin' me places I've never been
You've givin' love a brand new meanin'
Like a tattoo on my skin
So hold on tight and scoot on over
Girl, you can never get close enough
Let's push it past the limit chasin' this thing called love
And drive, drive, drive

[Verse 3]
Who needs the songs on a radio
When I can hear the beatin' of your heart?
Mile markers let us know
How far we've come and how far we're gonna go
Whoa-whoa-whoa
'Cause drive, drive

[Chorus]
Lost in the way that you got me feelin'
Takin' me places I've never been
You've givin' love a brand new meanin'
Like a tattoo on my skin
So hold on tight and scoot on over
Girl, you can never get close enough
Let's push it past the limit chasin' this thing called love
And drive, drive, drive

Let's push it past the limit chasin' this thing called love
I'm in it if you're in it, I wanna fell this rush
And drive, drive, drive

13467,She's High Again,Radio Free Universe,"[Verse 1]
There's a bloody needle skipping on a record
There's a stray dog sniffing at the rug
There's a lipstick Venus in the bathroom mirror
But she hasn't got time for love
I got the neighbors screaming in my bedroom
And I'm afraid to open the door
There's a crooked white cross in my baby's heart
It's got her going back for more

[Chorus]
There she goes again
She's high again
She's tripping with her friends
Without a care
She's high again
She's lonely without me

[Verse 2]
All the creatur–µs, they are running from the moonlight
Scatt–µring like mischief in the street
There's a cold wind blowing from the end of the world
It smells like addiction and defeat
All the angels have hidden in the basement
Where my love is tearing at the seams
She sold my soul to the shadows below
Now they're feeding on the fear inside my dreams

[Chorus]
There she goes again
She's high again
She's tripping with her friends
Without a care
She's high again
She's lonely without me

[Bridge]
I thought that you were a sign
But you're broken, it's all right
I thought that you were divine
But you're broken, it's all right

[Chorus]
There she goes again
She's high again
She's tripping with her friends
Without a care
She's high again
She's tripping with her friends

[Chorus]
There she goes again
She's high again
She's tripping with her friends
Without a care
She's high again
She's lonely without me

13456,Empires,Coastlines,"So many look yet so few truly see
So many humans, but no humanity
All of them someone
But never themselves
They're smiling and laughing
But going through hells

They mask what they're feeling
""Show none of the bad""
Theres no shame in crying
In showing you're sad

I feel no shame in crying
In showing I'm sad
No shame in crying
In showing I'm sad

Fake a smile re-assure
They must never know
Fake a smile readjust
Win their trust, win their trust

Its falling your empire in dust
Ashes, an empire in flames
See th–µ fire and the brimstone
See the mask melted down
Hear the truth remove the blindfold
Embold it on a tombstone

Feel the rush, feel adored
An even score

Followed by sheep
(I've tried to ignore)
You pretend to be deep
(I've tried to forget)
Feasting on diffidence

You make me sick

So many humans but no humanity
So many look yet so few truly see
So many humans but no humanity
So many look yet so few truly

Humanity!

It's falling your empire in dust
Ashes, an empire in flames

An empire in flames

13493,Suicide,Bad Apples,"I sit on my front porch and light a cigarette in the middle of the evening
There‚Äôs a thickness in the atmosphere around me

As I tilt my head back against the fortress of my home, all I can do is remember and wish these walls were painted blue

I hold my troubles in my lungs and release their smoldered vapors to be free amongst the sunset

I am personified in my own head as a better man than I‚Äôve ever been
And I want to be remembered as such

This is classic ‚ÄúHe picked the bad apple in the bunch‚Äù support system
I‚Äôll fetch the tinder. We‚Äôll smoke his witchcraft alive and send his ashes into the abyss

You‚Äôre a horrible mess
And I‚Äôm as horrible, yes

Echolocation when you‚Äôve lost sight of your light
It‚Äôs on some Super Moon shit

Tonight, we let the devils play advocate to my impressive bedrock foundation
Send signals straight from the nucleus

He is the center of all your problems
He is the answer to the qualms you haven‚Äôt solved yet
She‚Äôs the sweat that nervousness and psalms bred
She‚Äôs the lines betwixt your palms read

I pulled the bears out of the cottage
They were determined junkie-enablers who set their sights on the universe‚Äôs final mystery

What is it about the end of times that lets the hopeless live life contently?
Suddenly the final clue is found and all that‚Äôs left of curiosity is (You were right and I was wrong) like trying to convince the wrong date to a groundhog

Set Nibelheim to flames and call the man with one wing a bastard of divinity

Do you really want to know who you are?
Can you handle diving deep in your own heart?
Learn about yourself before your good luck turns tits up
Bottom of the well with your rope cut

Now tell me exactly how you plan to get us outta this one?

Make your mood malleable
The wrong guy will fuck you in the streets
The Good Guys and The Bad Guys take turns guessing how long until you fall to your knees

Sugar-Skull Kid lost the paint on his face to the rain
Exposed his pain to those who prefer not to care if it‚Äôs wet all year
I was raised to be indifferent to the thunder
Originate the platform
(Master of peasants)
Cut and conform just like your father did
(But when your life is so damn great I wonder if your father did it for you)
(Or Before you)
(I implore you)

Reconsider

2 shots of Jager later and you‚Äôll be concrete-stuck like floor glue
And you won‚Äôt ever remember being brave this afternoon

It‚Äôs not worth seeing you free if you‚Äôre not free with me
I‚Äôd rather have you suffer in a place where I can help you
Especially since you won‚Äôt ask me too

It hurts me alot more than you do
I‚Äôm vibrant and colossal
You‚Äôre far too frail and vulnerable

I don‚Äôt pick up your calls at all
From my day job I could watch your final fall

Out here I'll find myself

A moment lost in time
A life we failed to find

I turn back on myself again
Directionless I am
The compass inside my head
Has left me lost again

I finally felt alive

One breath that had set me free
A first step to be more than me
I found a place i could call my home
A new life to make my own

I managed to fix myself
With decency over wealth
I'd found a better way

I'm tearing at the seams

I'll find.. i'll found..

I am your wrath, I am your guilt, I am your lust

That I am your law, that I am your scar, I am your trust
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire

I blame it on my ADD baby, baby!
This is how an angel cries
I blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my ADD baby, baby!

13513,Hallelujah,Shim,"There‚Äôs a time to live and a time to die
Most of us don‚Äôt think twice
My little boy should‚Äôa checked your ego
There‚Äôs a time to speak and a time to lie
Most of us can‚Äôt decide
Do what you do to get what you need though
It‚Äôs a long way down
Can I get an Amen or an Hallelujah
If you‚Äôre lost or found
Can I get an Amen or an Hallelujah

There‚Äôs a time to scream and a time to cry
And if you don‚Äôt pick ‚Äòem right
You‚Äôll make a hot mess mess outta where you‚Äôre at now
There‚Äôs a time to sleep and a time to rise
But is it worth the fight?
You might be wrong or they might be what you say so
It‚Äôs a long way down
Can I get an Amen or an Hallelujah
If you‚Äôre lost or found
Can I get an Amen or an Hallelujah

Stuck in the life I designed
I can‚Äôt rewind
Going out of my mind
And if you feel me sing Hallelujah
If you feel me sing Hallelujah
If you feel me sing Hallelujah
If you feel me sing Hallelujah

13522,With Me Now,Blacklite District,"[Verse 1]
Got no time for my game, I put it on the shelf
And this money and fame ain't gonna earn itself
I'm not wastin' my time, you better recognize
The flame, the hustle, the pain, the redness in my eyes
When the pressure comes down you throw the towel in
But for me and my crew, that's where the work begins
At the end of the day we like to cut it loose
By the end of the night we're making bodies move
We're waiting, we're waitin', we're waitin'

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the bright lights, high life, everybody's feelin' right
Live it up, keep it poppin' all night
We are ready for the throw down, showdown, never fuckin' slow down
Live it up, tonight it's gonna go down
You know we need it loud
Shout if you're with me now

[Verse 2]
I could be goin' off without any warning
From 6 p.m. to at least 6 in the mornin'
When the sun comes out, we keep it goin'
Looks like a two-day bout, that's what we're throwin'
We're rollin' out, what's up with you?
You know the place we're going to
We're doing shots at breakfast time
We smoke two joints and cut-in-line
We're waitin', we're waitin', we're waitin'

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the bright lights, high life, everybody's feelin' right
Live it up, keep it poppin' all night
We are ready for the throw down, showdown, never fuckin' slow down
Live it up, tonight it's gonna go down
You know we need it loud
Shout if you're with me now
If you're with me now

[Bridge]
You need it, I bleed it
Just take it if you want it
Don't waste it, just taste it now

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the bright lights, high life, everybody's feelin' right
Live it up, keep it poppin' all night
We are ready for the throw down, showdown, never fuckin' slow down
Live it up, tonight it's gonna go down

You know we need it loud

I love you for never delivering me from pain
I love you for always driving me insane

I figured out that life was just a game
But I play to win so tell me who's to blame?

We point the finger at you
So tell me what you think you're gonna do

Rise up. Come face to face
Rise up. Let's make a change
Tomorrow could be the end
Rise up. You better take a shot
Rise up. When it's all you got
Tomorrow could be the end
Rise up

And now when I go back to yesterday
So close but still I'm so far away
You know we all gotta learn from our mistakes
I can't die young, I won't fade away

It's time we choose a side
It's time for do or die
Somethings are worth the fight
It's time to set it off

Rise up. Come face to face
Rise up. Let's make a change
Tomorrow could be the end
Rise up. You better take a shot
Rise up. When it's all you got
Tomorrow could be the end

13540,No Surprise,Theory of a Deadman,"Friday is when you left me
So I'll drink myself to sleep
And Sunday is when I'll wake up
Not to remember a thing

My friends all say the same thing
I don't know my new girl too well
(I know)
That all this lying gets to me
And no one seems to give a shit
(The way)
She talks to every guy in the bar
(I guess)
It should've raised some kind of alarm
Who'd ever think I'd go in and end up
Like all the other guys that you've gone and fucked?!

Well it ain't no surprise
That you'd turn me on and leave
It ain't no surprise
That you'd turn it around on me
I don't know why
You won't give me what I need
It ain't no surprise
That that bitch is leavin' me

My friends are mean to me
They say I don't break up too well
(They know)
All this crying gets to me
And no one seems to give a shit
Well I know you want to
So go on and say it
Just go on and say it
Just go on and say it

Well it ain't no surprise

The wheel embodies all that keeps on turning
Blood red skies, I feel so cold
No innocence, we play our roll
The wheel embodies all, where are we going?

See the miner throw his gold
Lifting her skirt howling loud like a wolf
Hell raising and full of sin
When Lola was dancing and showing her skin

Can't kill what I've denied
There's nothin' left to sacrifice
I stand on solid ground
Look up from falling down
There's nothin' left unsaid
I live with no regrets

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel so alive, I could die

[Chorus 1]
I would break, I would burn, I would suffer
There's nothin' I wouldn't do, do for you
I would lie, I would steal for no other
You make me feel so alive
So alive I'd die for you

[Verse 2]
There's nothin' left to hide
Want you to see inside
For me there is no doubt
My heart is yours, so rip it out
I don't expect you to understand this
I'll take what you give, but I won't take it for granted

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel so alive, I could die

[Chorus 2]
I would break, I would burn, I would suffer
There's nothin' I wouldn't do, do for you
I would lie, I would steal for no other
You make me feel so alive
So alive I'd die for you
Take my heart, just rip it out, rip it out
Take my heart, just rip it out, rip it out

[Chorus 3]
I would break, I would burn, I would suffer
There's nothin' I wouldn't do, do for you
I would lie, I would steal for no other
You make me feel so alive (So alive)
I would break, I would burn, I would suffer
There's nothin' I wouldn't do, do for you
I would lie, I would steal for no other
You make me feel so alive
So alive I'd die for you
Take my heart, just rip it out, rip it out
Take my heart, just rip it out, rip it out

13533,Light Up the Sky,Thousand Foot Krutch,"[Intro]
Watch me light the sky
Light up the sky
Watch me light the sky
Light up the sky

[Verse 1]
Hands held high sweat dripping off me
Light it softly, got these fakers trying to stop me
This ain't a hobby it's a way of life
Just like Holyfield and Tyson, gloves on fight night
Boom here comes the hurricane monsoon
Switched up, came to redecorate the room
My ears are ringing from hearing the same sound
So what now all of the walls just came down

[Pre-Chorus]
I blaze a trail like the rays from tail lights
Sound shaking the ground like earthquakes hail might
Someday I'll die but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

[Chorus]
Light up the sky
Watch me light the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky

[Verse 2]
Game time ripping mint condition
Lights out stomping all competition
My upmost to it's highest it gets no flyer
Uh oh we set the mainframe on fire
Boom cold lead from the peddle I push to the metal
The dust never settles
F5 level kick up the bass in the tremble
Because faith that's rebel, I could show you the devil

[Pre-Chorus]
I blaze a trail like the rays from taillights
Sound shaking the ground like earthquakes and hail might
Someday I'll die but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

[Chorus]
Light up the sky
Watch me light the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky

[Bridge]
Nowhere else have I seen such lions led by lambs
So if you're not afraid of us stand up and take my hand
We got a battle upfront but beyond that's the promise land
And when we all shout together then believe me they'll understand
Nowhere else have I seen such lions led by lambs
So if you're not afraid of us stand up and take my hand
We got a battle upfront but beyond that's the promise land
And when we all shout together then believe me they'll understand

I blaze a trail like the rays from taillights
Sound shaking the ground like earthquakes and hail might
Someday I'll die but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

A pillar an unafraid
Don't drop the shade
You down with O-p-p-o-s-i-n-g?

Tastefully hating these
Thought police
Unbreakable no release

Until my dying day

Unconscious logic quick to the coffin
Stray from the path footsteps like this
On a soap box but you're all silent
I'm sick of the same story
So boring
If you try to ignore me this is your last warning
I don't fuck with the obvious
Up top while you're all in the audience

13529,The Unforgiven II,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you? Yeah
What I've felt, what I've known

Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Verse 2]
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone

Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you? Yeah

Behind the door, should I open it for you? (So I dub thee Unforgiven)

13514,Numb,The Veer Union,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Every step that I take is another mistake to you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb

From the shadows of the dark unknown
You will crawl up from your hiding place
And take a look in the mirror, see the truth in your face

I'm unbreakable
Can't defeat me, though I'm bleeding
Unbreakable
Though I'm bending, I'll never break
Unbreakable
Unbreakable

13546,Mystify,Saving Abel,"You know you mystify...

Consuming moments just like these
I'm being broken down on my knees
It's getting clear, what do I see?
I feel your love reaching out for me
Oh, mirror, it's so clear
That I'll run and disappear
So mirror, mirror on the wall:
Who's the biggest fool of all?

Yeah...
You know you mystify me
You bring a light to the life, I'm breathing
Yeah...
You know you mystify...
You bring a light to the life, I'm living

Why am I running from the past
With all the memories that couldn't last?
So when you peek into my soul
Why do I run, when you make me whole?
So mirror, mirror on the wall:
Who's the biggest fool of all?

With no light, no sight, no eyes I see
I can't help, I feel love reaching out for me

Yeah...

Yeah...
You know you mystify me
You bring a light to the life, I'm breathing
Yeah...
You know you mystify...
You bring a light to the life, I'm living

Yeah...
You know you mystify...

13536,What If I Was Nothing,All That Remains,"[Verse 1]
Just let it go, don't wanna argue anymore
I can't be sure, I know just what we're fightin' for
I know you're scared and that you're thinkin' I may go
I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard, it seems we've worked at this so long
It's often foolish pride that tells us we're not wrong
I hear your voice, you tell me that you'll never go
And I believe it, I believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you

[Bridge]
And we can keep this goin' on
We'll make it work some way
And every step, it makes us
Stronger every day

And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true? (What if I was nothin'?)
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you (What if I was nothin')
So what if I was angry? (What if I was nothin') What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you
"
13531,Tired,Stone Sour,"[Verse 1]
I'm alive in here, so alive in here
Pulling down a little peace
I'm open wide in here, slow to rise in here
Saving grace and killing me
You say this only makes me incomplete
I'm canceled out and rendered obsolete
Tell the mad chameleon he's not welcome anymore
I know what I'm looking for...

[Chorus 1]
Somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know, I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me; I'm just too young to care

[Verse 2]
I can see in here; I can feel in here
Comatose with common sense
I take my time in here; somebody get me out of here
What am I so against?
I just want to watch the whole world burn
Lost a million times and I won't learn
Show me someone innocent, I'll show you there's no proof
I may be gone, but I'm no fool...

[Chorus 2]
I'm not close; I'm not safe
I don't know, don't know, am I better off in chains?
The one is not aware
So stay away from me; I'm just too young to care

[Outro/Chorus]
I need somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know, I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me; I'm just too young to care
Too young to care

13526,Strife,Trivium,"[Verse 1]
My anxiety's clawing
Out from deep within me
It burns within as my throat
Begins to cauterize

This negativity's leeching
Any shred of composure
Rationale has decayed and left
Me bound in madness

[Pre-Chorus]
I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul

[Chorus]
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

[Verse 2]
How I yearn for the silence
For an end to the voices
The calamity grows and the
Deafness leads to disarray

Guilt buries me alive
In a coffin‚Äîcriticized
I shouldered the blame and dug
This hole for me to lay in

[Pre-Chorus]
I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul

[Chorus]
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I...

I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain

And I struggle to find my way
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

Think twice before you open that mouth
Save your breath, hold it in your lungs

The white man came and took out everyone
The used dirty blankets and they used machine guns
And they didn't think twice about what they've done

He had a bunch of money but he got taken
He got a bunch of lawyers and he tried to sue
But Bernie looked at him and said, ""Hey, fuck you!""

Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!

I see the stars through a mirror
Tired mechanical heart
Beats 'til the song disappears

13586,Skeletons,Heartist,"I've forgotten how to feel
These nights, they chill me
Light the way to something real
And save me from myself
You chase the cold from me
With you
I'm learning to see
I just need you to know
I tried to find a way
To bury all the pain
But these skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons won't sleep
You gave me clarity
And showed me how to free
These skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons in me
These skeletons in me
How can I forget the past
If it still haunts me?
Your ghost never fades away
When I gave up everything
You took a hold of me
And proved I'm more than a broken wing
I just need you to know
I tried to find a way
To bury all the pain
But these skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons won't sleep
You gave me clarity
And showed me how to free
These skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons in me
These skeletons in me
Sympathy is hard to find
So maybe life should be defined
By all the pain we left behind;
It rots inside our minds
You make me believe
I tried to find a way
To bury all the pain
But these skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons won't sleep
You gave me clarity
And showed me how to free
These skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons in me
These skeletons in me
These skeletons in me

I've been through and seen a lot
Left at the bottom and the top
We're on borrowed time, but time isn't enough

I am no king, I have no throne

Whatever it takes to get you by
And all of those lies that keep you clean
Are really beneath your plastic wings

Turn on the light that keeps us blind
Holding believers under your thumb
Pulling the veil over their eyes
Speaking in fables with your electric halo

Prey on the guilty and confused
Burn all the bridges that you've used
To cross into lives to fill a hole
You'll say anything to keep control

Turn on the light that keeps us blind
Holding believers under your thumb
Pulling the veil over their eyes
Speaking in fables with your electric halo

You don't think it's hard for me
No one knows you better
You don't think I'll set you free
No one knows you better

Speaking in fables

Turn out the light that keeps us blind
Holding the levers under your thumb
Pulling the veil over their eyes

13562,Try to Fight It,Shallow Side,"I can't stand the way you always lead me on
I follow blindly right behind you and I still get lost
You never look and check to see
If maybe I'm okay

Is filled with mistakes

I, I lose it all when I speak to you
Your face, your eyes, changes what I've been through
Now, now I can't help but to scream your name
I try to fight it, I try to fight it

And I can't stand the way your lies they seem so real
Now every time I burn inside it's all that I can feel
You promise you will always change
But things just stay the same
You bend me 'til you break me and it's driving me insane
But then I see you smile

Better to be blind than to try and resist
Say your prayers and cease and desist, We all have secrets

Everyone nods, so what's the meaning in all this
We have a choice to live and to exist
You are mark
We don't have regrets

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

Pushed close to the edge , I can't go any further
Tear me apart with mechanical murder
Ignorant bliss in a time of disorder
God save some bastards

Nightmares come and I can't open my eyes
Running from the best, I know that I can't hide
I get knocked down shout up to the sky
I've got no regrets

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

We don't belong here
The sound of a thousand vultures
Will drown us out and confiscate our bones
We stand alone

We don't belong here
The sound of a thousand vultures
Will drown us out, and confiscate our bones
We stand alone
We stand alone
We stand alone

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

Current takes me, breath escapes me, inducing coma sleep
Close my eyes, I'm paralyzed, finally at peace

While making eyes with who I'm not supposed to
And all you say, say, say, is

Hey, Hey kid, you've got another thing coming, coming
You think the world owes you but I ain't asking for nothing no, no
Hey kid
I ain't asking for nothing no

I meant to cut you off
I meant to interrupt
Cause you ain't saying nothing, no you just ain't saying much
It don't bother me, I don't got an attitude
I'm just who I am, from my head to my boots
Forgot to call while breaking city curfew
While making eyes with who I'm not supposed to
And all you say, say, say, is

Hey, Hey kid, you've got another thing coming, coming
You think the world owes you but I ain't asking for nothing no, no
Hey kid
I ain't asking for nothing no

Give you a piece of my heart, I think you already know
I told you right from the start, you'd never have control
I don't care, you can talk, talk all you want
Nothing's going to stop me from doing what I want

Hey, Hey kid, you've got another thing coming, coming
You think the world owes you but I ain't asking for nothing no, no
Hey kid
I ain't asking for nothing no

13589,Set Me on Fire,Flyleaf,"[Verse 1]
Oh, what a cold, dark world it is to walk through
Alone with a fear-filled head
Thinking of losing you is a haunted song
And a dread much worse than the fear of death

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I feel the fear rising up
Climbing up, taking over my body
And I feel my pulse starting up
Waking me again

[Chorus]
Open my eyes, I'm reaching for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire
I'm burning inside, I'm waiting for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire

[Verse 2]
Your hand in mine, oh, I feel the fire
Two hearts that beat, oh, to feed the fire

You are a spark that shines a light
Where we could belong together, factionless
Let's keep it burning bright 'til we're floating away
'Til we're ashes dancing inside the flames

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I feel the fear rising up
Climbing up, taking over my body
And I feel my pulse starting up
Waking me again

Open my eyes, I'm reaching for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire
I'm burning inside, I'm waiting for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire

Don't wanna be sly and defile you
Desecrate my mind and rely on you
I just wanna break this crown
But it's hard when I'm so run down
And you're so cynical
Narcissistic cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

[Chorus]
Sometimes I hate the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me, taking its sweet time

Holding on, I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days

Nothing's good about the hell you put me through

See that life that has come unbound
And you're so cynical

Got to bring myself back from the dead

Sometimes I hate the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape

When love changes faces, appears from nowhere
When beautiful, lovely is ugly alone
You need me back bad, just can't be on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb
Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb

[Chorus]
I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye

Not love of yourself but the love you have lost
When sad desperation is lonely despair
You don't love yourself, you've got no love to share

Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb

Well, they say that we are tragic
And they say we're born to lose

You're the heathen, I'm the fool

But today you'll be the master
Or the slave it's up to you
Oh, my beautiful disaster
Take me anyway you choose

Don't fight it
Ignite it

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
It may never be this good again

[Verse 2]
It's like a new religion
Speak in tongues, come see the light
Do not trip on inhibitions
That will only waste my time

Let me tempt you with the evils
Of the flesh and so much more
Like a babylon redeemer
Like a pusher like a whore

Just try it
You'll like it
I'll give you more

Ooh, you feel the hunter's gaze
A shadow even in the dark of night
Scheming your early grave
He's going to leave you dead or dying
Draining all the blood he craves
You never thought you'd be meat for the market
What'd you expect when you sold your name?

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again
To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when courage takes its hold
You face down all the would-be masters
And break the ties that bind your goals
This is gonna be the moment
Your blood wakes and fills your veins
Stand tall with your strength, defy them
Become your own fate

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again
To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within

Who stands the storm and faces
The horrors that darkness breeds?
Who will take the life they're given
And cast light for all to see?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?
What's built from cowards that we praise?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?

How to fall in line, how there's no other way

You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame

[Bridge: Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of bein' rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split, nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowin' as soon as the dough or the deal peak
Say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep, until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock 'til pop and radio
And record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see
That green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game
To me you're all the same, you're guilty

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same

Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same

Remember every little lie (Every little lie) and every last goodbye
Promises you broke, words you choked on
And I never walked away (Never walked away)

13577,This Is the Time,Nothing More,"[Verse 1]
When did we become these sinking stones?
When did we build this broken home?
Holding each other like ransom notes
Dropping our hearts to grip our brothers' throats

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't see because you don't know
You're caught below beneath your own shadow
Stuck inside, half alive
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?
Close your mind, identify
Do you feel, do you feel, do you call this a life?
All you waited for
Drowning just to keep score
We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

[Chorus]
This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes, we're walking blind

[Verse 2]
Anchored in anger, we exile ourselves
Bitter blood builds our prison cells
Darker water now fills our lungs
The depths of our heart have blacked the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't see because you don't know
You're caught below beneath your own shadow
Stuck inside, half alive
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?
Close your mind, identify
Do you feel, do you feel, do you call this a life?
All you waited for
Drowning just to keep score
We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes, we're walking blind

Naked we come, naked we leave
Fools we are, to hold tightly
We are free, we are free
(We are, we are the key, we are the jail, we are the key, yeah)

This is the time that we let it go
Yeah, these are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we just open our eyes (If we just open our eyes)
This is the time that we let it go
And this is the pain we are forced to know
Singing the song that's inside, inside us all, inside us all

Where time dissolves the brightest flame

And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

But when we're at our worst
I miss the misery

I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
I miss the rough sex, leaves me a mess
I miss the feeling of pains in my chest
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault

Alright, rock 'n' roll, yeah

At the end of a dream
If you know where I mean
When the mist just starts to clear
In a similar way
At the end of today
I could feel the sound of writing on the wall

It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wine
I can hear it screamin' in my mind

Long live rock and roll
Let it live

It was simple but strange
And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all

It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wine
I can hear it screamin' in my mind

And tell everyone here

They can sail above it all on what they've found

It's the best that you can do
Like a sound that's everywhere
I can hear it screaming through the air

In walked this chick and I knew she was up for something
And I kissed her right there out of the blue

I said ""Hey baby, meet me I'm a tough guy
Got my cycle outside, you wanna try?""
She just looked at me and rolled them big eyes

Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 1: Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey]
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

[Post-Chorus: Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey]
How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see, no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 2: Roger Daltrey & Pete Townshend]
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]
Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear wind blows

Some hang on to ""used to be""
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb them a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear wind blows

Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear wind blows

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong

My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same
Without you, I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl you'd never, never know
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

Without you, my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
Knowing someday I'd grow strong
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only you as we grow old

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

13617,You're All I Need,White Lion,"[Verse 1]
I know that she's waiting
For me to say forever
I know that I sometimes
Just don't know how to tell her
I want to hold and kiss her
Give her my love
Make her believe
She doesn't know
She doesn't know

[Chorus]
You're all I need beside me, girl!
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart

[Post-Chorus]
You're all that I need
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
I know that she's always
There when I need her loving
I know that I never
Told her how much I love her
I see her face before me
I look in her eyes
Just wondering why
She doesn't know
She doesn't know

[Pre-Chorus]
She doesn't know

[Chorus]
You're all I need beside me, girl!
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart

[Bridge]
Say
Say that you'll be there
Whenever I reach out
To feel your hand in mine
Stay
Stay within my heart
Whenever I'm alone
I know that you are there
Oooooh!

[Chorus]
You're all I need beside me, girl!
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart
You're all I need beside me, girl!
All that I need
All I need to turn my world
All that I need beside me, girl!
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart

[Outro]
All that I need
Is for you to believe
All that I need
Is you

Coming out of nowhere
Driving like rain
Stormbringer dance
On the thunder again
Dark cloud gathering
Breaking the day
No point running
Because it's coming your way

[Chorus]
Ride the rainbow
Crack the sky
Stormbringer coming
Time to die
Got to keep running
Stormbringer coming

He's going to make you bleed
And you know he's gonna get you

Rainbow shaker
On a stallion twister
Bareback rider
On the eye of the sky
Stormbringer coming down
Meaning to stay
Thunder and lightning
Heading your way

Time to die
Got to keep running
Stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need
He's going to make you bleed

13605,When Doves Cry,Prince,"Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Say it!
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds lik–µ
When doves cry

Everybody!
Huh huh huh huh huh
Say it

13647,Rain,Status Quo,"How can I see what I'm needing for
How can I give what I gave before
How can you tell me that you want me to stay
How can I stay when I'm trying to say
That I can't live without the rain
Yes I can't live without the rain

How can I feel what I'm trying to feel
How can I move when I'm heel to heel
You're always shouting about the doubt in my eyes
But I can't answer 'cos my eyes are so dry
Now I can't live without the rain
Yes I can't live without the rain

Now I can't live without the rain
That's falling on my head
Rain that's falling on my head
Rain that's falling
Rain that's falling
Rain that's falling on my head

I started thinking back to you know when
I'd like to send a line but then again
How can I write you when there ain't no light?
I'm feeling tired tonight but that is all right
Now I can't live without the rain
Yes I can't live without the rain

She trying to let me down as fast as she can

It's only love, it drives me crazy
It's only love pretty baby

I got to tell you what I'm feeling inside, I could lie to myself, but it's true

I lived so long believin' all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time

[Chorus]
It's forever, this time I know, and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is through, girl, I'll be loving you forever

[Verse 2]
I hear the echo of a promise I made
When you're strong, you can stand on your own
Those words grow distant as I look at your face
No, I don't want to go it alone
I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is telling me this time

It's forever, this time I know, and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is through, girl, I'll be loving you forever

Forever, until my life is through, girl, I'll be loving you forever

13627,Go to Hell,Alice Cooper,"[Intro]
For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged
You can go to Hell

[Verse 1]
For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly
For making us doubt our parent's authority
For choosing to be a living obscenity
You can go to Hell

[Hook]
You're something that never should have happened
You'd even make your Grandma sick

[Verse 2]
You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane
You'd gift wrap a leper and mail him to your Aunt Jane
You'd even force-feed a diabetic a candy cane
You can go to Hell

13634,Astronomy,Blue √ñyster Cult,"[Verse 1]
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May
And now, the sands become a crust
Most of you have gone away

[Verse 2]
Come Suzy dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you want to know where winds come from
Well, it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there, you know
At the four winds bar

[Bridge]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors barred and windows barred
One door let to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
In hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Or the light that never, never warms
Never warms, never warms

[Verse 3]
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Suzy dear
Would find themselves at the four winds bar
It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

[Bridge]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Call me Desdinova, eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent

High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?

[Refrain]
Oh, I see his face

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe

[Chorus]
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?

[Verse 2]
Hot wind, moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky

[Refrain]
Oh, I see his face

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, far?
When do we leave?
Hey, I believe, I believe

[Chorus]
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
Too many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But we don't know why
Ooh, now where do we go

[Instrumental Break/Guitar Solo 03:30-05:13]

All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound, as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand

[Refrain]
Oh, I see his face

[Pre-Chorus]
Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far?
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed

[Chorus]
In heat and rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly

[Outro]
But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many die
Just to see him fly
Look at my flesh and bone
Now, look, look, look, look
Look at his tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there, on the horizon
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Time is standing still
He gave me back my will
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
The place I've known
But it's not home
Ooh
Take me back
He gave me back my will
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
The place I've known
But it's not home
Ooh
Take me back, take me back
Back to my home ooh, ooh, ooh

I spent ten years, half my life
Just getting ready, then it was time
Warpage in my figures, radios appear
Midnight was the barrier, back in 1963

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard]
Each night, the covers were unfolded
Each night, it's Suzy's turn to ride
While Charles, the one they call her brother
Covers on his eyes
Murmurs in the background
It will be time

[Verse 2: Albert Bouchard]
Oh yeah!
Suzy and her brother, Charles, the grinning boy
Put me in the back seat and they took me for a ride
Yeah, the radio was on, can't you dig the locomotion
Kingdoms of the radio, 45 RPM
(Too much revolution, then)

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard]
Each night, the covers were unfolded
Each night, it's Suzy's turn to ride
While Charles, the one they call her brother
Covers on his eyes
Murmurs in the background
It will be time

It's past midnight said Charles, the grinning boy!
And looking at me greedily, said it's 1964!

Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I tell you
I'm in love with you

Don't believe me if I tell you
That I wrote this song for you
There just might be
Some other silly pretty girl
I'm singing to

Don't believe a word
For words are so easily spoken
And your heart is just like that promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe a word
Cause words can tell lies
And lies are no company
When there's tears in your eyes

Don't believe me if I tell you
Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I tell you
That I'm in love with you

13626,From the Inside,Alice Cooper,"[Verse 1]
I got lost on the road somewhere
Was it Texas or was it Canada?
Drinking whiskey in the morning light
I work the stage all night long
At first we laughed about it
My long-haired drunken friends
Proposed a toast to Jimmy's ghost
I never dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end

[Chorus]
I'm stuck here on the inside looking out
I'm just another case
Where's my makeup, where's my face
On the inside

[Verse 2]
You've got your kicks from what you saw up there
Eight bucks even buys a folding chair
I was downing Seagrams on another flight
And I worked that stage all night long (Worked that stage all night long)
You were screaming for the villain up there
And I was much obliged
The old road sure screwed me good this time
It's hard to see where the vicious circle ends

[Chorus]
I'm stuck here on the inside, I'm looking out
That's no big disgrace
Where's my makeup, where's my face
On the inside, on the inside

I'm stuck here on the inside looking out
I'm just another case
Where's my makeup, where's my face

And I chanced to meet him one night wandering
He told me tales and he drank my wine
Me and my magic man, kinda feelin' fine

[Verse 2]
He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire
And as he spoke, I felt a deep desire
To free the world of its fear and pain
And help the people to feel free again

[Bridge]
Why don't we listen to the
Voices in our heart?
Cause then I know we'd find
We're not so far apart
Everybody's got to be happy
Everyone should sing
For we know the joy of life
Peace and love can bring

So spoke the wizard
In his mountain home
The vision of his wisdom
Means we'll never be alone
And I will dream of my magic night
And the million silver stars
That guide me with their light

Past midnight I still see the land
People are saying the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
The city's ablaze, the town's on fire
The woman's flames are reaching higher
We were fools, we called her a liar
All I hear is
""Burn!""

I didn't believe she was the devil's sperm
She said, ""Curse you all, you'll never learn""

Warning came, no one cared
Earth was shaking, we stood and stared
When it came no one was spared

The man on the silver mountain
I'm the night, the light
The black and the white
The man on the silver mountain

13629,Billion Dollar Babies,Alice Cooper,"[Verse 1]
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley, loves me like no other lover
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little monster, baby I adore ya
Man or woman living
Couldn‚Äôt love you like me baby

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands
Aww!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, billion dollar baby
I got you in a dimestore
No other little girl could ever
Hold you any tighter
Any tighter than me maybe
Billion dollar baby
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe
Fighting like a dog
That's been infected by the rabies

[Chorus]
We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands

Yeah, billion dollar baby
Trillion dollar baby
Zillion dollar baby
Billion dollar baby
Billion dollar baby, baby

13615,I'd Do Anything For Love,Meat Loaf,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathin' fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothin' I've ever
Seen before or will again

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turnin'
As long as the stars are burnin'
As long as your dreams are comin' true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feelin'
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turnin'
As long as the fires are burnin'
As long as your prayers are comin' true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that

[Chorus]
But I'll never stop dreamin' of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Bridge: Lorraine Crosby & Meat Loaf]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
Will you hold me sacred?
Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life?
I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh no, now, I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me somethin' I can take home?
Now, I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now, I can do that
Oh no, now, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwin' around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Outro]
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

13610,Take My Breath Away,Berlin,"[Verse 1]
Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

[Verse 2]
Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

[Chorus]
My love, take my breath away

[Bridge]
Through the hourglass, I saw you
In time, you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today, I'm unafraid

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

[Verse 3]
Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love

13607,The Power of Love,Jennifer Rush,"[Verse 1]
The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now as I look into your eyes
I hold on to your body and feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender, a love that I could not forsake

[Hook 1]
Cause I am your lady and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
Lost is how I'm feeling, lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
But never wonder where I am
Cause I am always by your side

[Hook 2]
Cause I am your lady, and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love

[Bridge]
The sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on is light-years away

[Hook 2]
Cause I am your lady, and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love

We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love
Ooh, the power of love
The power of love

Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn 'bout the power of love

Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
""Forgive me if I seem out of line""
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away!

That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

Sayin' love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus

You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there, gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white
All men are equal till the victory is won
No color or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun

[Chorus - Gary Moore]
Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

[Verse 2 - Phil Lynott & Gary Moore]
It doesn't matter if you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause for which you fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag no uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

No one to take the blame
The cries of every nation
They're falling on deaf ears again

Out in the fields
Out in the fields, they are falling one by one
Out in the fields, no flag has ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, death is just a heartbeat away
Out in the fields, a heartbeat away
Out in the fields

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day

I would climb any mountain
Sail across a stormy sea
If that's what it takes me, baby
To show you how much you mean to me

That brings out the man in me

Spent my time so foolishly
But now that I've found you
Together we'll make history

You're all that my eyes can see

Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker

[Chorus]
So, it's on and on and on
It's Heaven and Hell
Oh well, yeah

The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner

It goes on and on and on
Heaven and Hell, I can tell

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you gotta ride it well

Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams

The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no
Fool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer
Fool, fool, fool

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Refrain]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

13692,Run to the Hills,Iron Maiden,"[Intro]
White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came, too much for Cree
Oh, will we ever be set free?

[Verse 1]
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom, the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards, attack

[Chorus]
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

[Verse 2]
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

13657,Diamonds and Rust,Judas Priest,"[Verse 1]
I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

[Chorus]
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

[Bridge]
Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square
Our breath comes on white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me, we both could've died then and there

[Verse 2]
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Cause I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes, I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

[Chorus]
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust

In demand, but second-hand

Up to date, but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You‚Äôre so right, but overnight
You‚Äôre the one who has to take the blame, yeah

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can‚Äôt believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried?
Yeah-ay-ay-ay, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Don‚Äôt delay, you‚Äôre in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday‚Äôs star is Monday‚Äôs scar
Out of date before you‚Äôre even seen, yeah
At the top so quick to flop
You‚Äôre so new, but rotting in decay
Like butterfly, so quick to die
But you‚Äôre only looking for today, yeah

Well, I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes, I'm leaving the sorrow and heartaches
Before it takes me away from my mind

Send me love and I may let you see me
Send me hopes I can fit in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead

When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And let tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me

I'll just go back to pretending I'm living

It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend

With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet

13654,After Forever,Black Sabbath,"[Verse 1]
Have you ever thought about your soul
Can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think
That when you are dead
You just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head
Or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name
That you read in the book
When you were in school?

[Verse 2]
When you think about death
Do you lose your breath
Or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope
On the end of a rope?
Do you think he's a fool?
Well, I have seen the truth
Yes, I've seen the light
And I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared
When you're lonely and scared
At the end of our days

[Bridge]
Could it be you're afraid
Of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realise before they criticise
That God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small
That you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run?
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say that you may as well
Worship the sun?

[Verse 3]
I think it was true it was people like you
That crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had
Was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure
When your day is near
Say you don't believe?
You had the chance
But you turned it down
Now you can't retrieve

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Perhaps you'll think before you say
""God is dead and gone""
Open your eyes, just realise
That He is the one
The only one who can save you now
From all this sin and hate
Or will you jeer at all you hear?
Yes, I think it's too late

He couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him, fed him by hand

Yeah! I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

Withdrawn he'd sit there
Staring into space
No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled
It seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye‚Äîand then he died

Yeah! I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind

This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

How many like him are there still
Who to us, all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands, blank and lost

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find

Right
Yeah, yeah

Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down 'cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nitty-gritty

With her face in her beer

Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto

Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing

...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...

I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day...""

Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to

Little child dry your crying eyes
How can I explain the fear you feel inside
Cause you were born into this evil world
Where man is killing man and no one knows just why
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again

[Chorus:]
When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 2:]
Little child you must show the way
To a better day for all the young
Cause you were born for all the world to see
That we all can live with love and peace
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

[Chorus]
When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 3:]
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

When the children cry let them know we tried
When the children fight let them know it ain't right
When the children pray let them know the way
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealin' second after second just 'cause I know I can, but

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from

Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you is me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I oughta be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in

And now, you think this person really is me
And I'm trying to bend the truth

Sniffing around your door

13726,Lifelong Dayshift,Middle Class Rut,"[Verse 1]
Dangling on the edge of a lifelong dayshift
Sick of the days but they just don't work
Someone come and pull me out
I never lived a full year
And if it ain't working then it's another
So take what you need; with the rest don't bother
Someone come and pull me out
I never lived a full year
And every little need ain't your need
But you ain't the only mouth that you gotta feed
Or find a way to God
You're so wrapped up in it that you can't survive

[Chorus 1]
Your life, it ain't worth wasting mine on
Your life, it ain't worth it
No, no-no it ain't

[Verse 2]
Thinking that you're life at the time is defined by
A hammer and a nail and you just gotta like it
Someone come and pull me out
I never lived a full year
But you ain't the kind that will lose that easy
One thing you got is the will to get it right
Someone come and pull me out
I never lived a full year

[Chorus 2]
Your life, it ain't worth wasting mine on (x2)
I won't accept that every day
Will just be thrown away
Because your life, it ain't worth wasting mine on

All or nothing
Everything's silent and your head just sweating
Something not sure except the way you're heading
You know it's getting closer, closer

[Chorus]
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say ""all in"", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing

[Verse 2]
All or nothing
Take a step forward and you know she's looking
Take a deep breath before you make it happen
Keeps on getting closer, closer

[Chorus]
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say ""all in"", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing

All or nothing
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say ""all in"", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say ""all in"", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing

13715,By My Side,3 Doors Down,"[Verse 1]
They blazed a trail I dared to run
They built this world and I have come
I need another, like a brother
For a cryin' shoulder

[Chorus]
This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
I can feel my soul, it‚Äôs bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?

[Verse 2]
Sober mind, time now is gone
They carved my body not of stone
A pretty maze of emptiness
I said, ""To hell with all the rest""

[Chorus]
This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
I can feel my soul, it‚Äôs bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?

I can feel my soul, it‚Äôs bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?

13736,Stand Up,Trapt,"Why don't you let me be
Leave me alone
You start a fire inside that I could never control
You wanna see a reaction

Come on and cut me down
I've gone as far as I'll go
Now I'm crossing the line and I am letting you know
Well here's your reaction

Stand up

Walk away before I finish what you started
Face to face I will put you in your place
End this game before I finish what you started
Face to face everything will change

How my anger has grown
Got a feeling inside I can't seem to control

Please help me ‚Äòcause I'm breaking down

Keep it inside, the image portrayed
As if I couldn't stand losing, as if I couldn't be saved, no way
A small confession, I think I'm starting to lose it
I think I'm drifting away from the people I really need
A small reflection on when we were younger
We had it all figured out, ‚Äòcause we had everything covered
Now we're older, it's getting harder to see
What this future will hold for us?
What the fuck are we going to be?

I'm afraid I'm falling farther away
I'm falling farther away
I'm falling farther away

Been cheatin' gravity and waitin' on the fall
How did this come over me? I thought I was above it all

God will begin to speak forth
Our righteousness is of Him, sayeth the Lord.""
Get back

Can you feel, I'm not like you anymore
I can't see, I can't breathe
See you quiver like the dogs on the streets
Looking down on as I beat you

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a bad religion
From a broken nation
It's a contradiction
And I can't take it anymore
Yeah

Who's to say I won't like you anyway?
Take a deep breath, I'm alive
Can you hear me? I'm alive inside of you
Agony creeps up behind you

From a broken nation (a broken nation)

We barely remember
Who or what came before this precious moment
We are choosing to be here right now
Hold on, stay inside

[Pre-Chorus]
This holy reality
This holy experience
Choosing to be here in

This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me
Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion

Alive

In this holy reality
In this holy experience
Choosing to be here in

This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me
Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion

Twirling 'round with this familiar parable
Spinning, weaving 'round each new experience
Recognize this as a holy gift and
Celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing
A chance to be alive and breathing

This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality
Embrace this moment, remember
We are eternal, all this pain is an illusion

13733,Southtown,P.O.D.,"[Verse 1]
Welcome to hard times
Back again like its never been, for the first time
It seems to mess with my head
So when I realize what it takes can I relate
With whatever but never will it drive me to hate
Could be the next guy that you take before I wake
Now I lay me down to sleep, eyes tight when I pray
This here is real life, circumstances make you think
Should I be counting my blessings
The next second my eyes blink?

[Chorus]
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive

[Verse 2]
One love, its easier said than done
Can I rise above everything that's in my way?
Like words you say
You let your tongue get loose
But when push comes to shove, not used to walking away
I keep on looking up, cause these times, they getting tough
Tomorrow's gone, and its the same old song
Father fill my cup, give me strength to power up
A life to shine, you're the diamond in this rough

[Chorus]
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive

Don't wanna throw up my fist, ain't gots to be like this
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
It ain't gots to be (Like this)

13708,Not Falling,Mudvayne,"[Verse 1]
Always, known in, all my time
A little left of center now
Reflect as I realize
That all I need is to find the middle pillar path
To sit like the sun by a star in the sky and just be
Sinners, casting stones at me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I, I stand, not crawling
Not falling down
I, I bleed the demons
That drag me down

[Chorus]
I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, the center
Not falling down of calms within the eye
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That pull me down for me and no one else

[Verse 2]
Goodbye, sunshine, I've put it out again, sad
I'm over, personalities, conflicting
I don't need you, or anyone, but me
I'll just be, living my own life
I feel my glowing center grow, infecting
I feel alive
Shovel dirt over lime
Plant it in myself to sit like a seed
Under covers of earth and just be
Sinners, pointing fingers at me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, by myself
Not falling down
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That drag me down

[Chorus]
I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, the center
Not falling down of calms within the eye
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That pull me down for me and no one else

Come play kill
Refuse my body, refuse my shadow
Stone cold will
Refuse to lead this, refuse to follow
Bitter pills
Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow
I'm fueled godless
Come play, come play
Kill
Just be, just be, just be, just be, just be, just be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, by myself
Not falling down
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That drag me down

Not falling down of calms within the eye
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That pull me down for me and no one else

13728,Control,Puddle Of Mudd,"[Verse 1]
I love the way you look at me
I feel the pain you place inside
You lock me up inside your dirty cage
While I'm alone inside my mind
I like to teach you all the rules
I get to see them set in stone
I like it when you chain me to the bed
But then your secrets never show

[Chorus]
I need to feel you
You need to feel me
I can't control you
You're not the one for me, no
I can't control you
You can't control me
I need to feel you

I love the way you rake my skin
I feel the hate you place inside
I need to get your voice out of my head
'Cause I'm that guy you'll never find
I think you know all of the rules
There's no expressions on your face
I hope that someday you will let me go
Release me from my dirty cage

13732,Your Disease,Saliva,"In one moment, I'm goin' all the way
I make my poetry everyday
And I'm frozen, comin' right on time
I froze my mind with that serious rhyme
And I'm open, comin' up inside you
Know my mind has got a grand design
And I'm flowin, goin' all the way
I make my point to be everyday, come on!

And I wanna take you down
But your soul cannot be found
Doesn't matter much, you see
'Cause your disease is killin' me
And you know it's only right
'Cause it feels like paradise
And I know nothin' is for free
'Cause your disease is killin' me

My mind's broken, I'm goin' up in smoke
If you breathe my toke, I'm guaranteein' you choke
And I'm chosen to testify for masses
Wear dark glasses like the cops in Texas
All-knowing, it's not a premonition
Kill the competition like a man on a mission
I'm blowin, comin' up inside
Like the Bee Gees' cry, I'm just stayin alive, come on!

And I wanna take you down
But your soul cannot be found
Doesn't matter much, you see
'Cause your disease is killin' me
And you know it's only right
'Cause it feels like paradise
And I know nothin' is for free
'Cause your disease is killin' me

So now I'm finally going down
Can I find my way back home?
Now there's no one else around
Can I find my way back home?
Will I ever see the light
Even though I'm fallin'?
(Will there ever be any peace for me?)
Even though I'm fallin'
(Will there ever be any peace for me?)
Even though I'm fallin'
(Will there ever be any peace for me?)

And I wanna take you down
But your soul cannot be found
Doesn't matter much, you see
'Cause your disease is killin' me
And you know it's only right
'Cause it feels like paradise
And I know nothin' is for free
'Cause your disease is killin' me

And I wanna take you down
But your soul cannot be found
Doesn't matter much, you see
'Cause your disease is killin' me
And you know it's only right
'Cause it feels like paradise
And I know nothin' is for free
'Cause your disease is killin' me

Like anathema, I will remain, forever will remain
From below, in my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burn

No life, but nothing's died
No lights, but quite the show
Just as long as no one ever knows

Better than witnessing newborn nebulas in bloom
She who sees from up high smiles and surely sings
Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings

Pins and needles, nice to know you

Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

[Verse 2]
Dreaming about Providence
And whether mice or men have second tries
Maybe we've been livin' with our eyes half open
Maybe we're bent and broken, broken

[Chorus]
Ah-we were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

[Bridge]
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than the wars of our fathers
And everything inside screams for second life, yeah

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more (We were meant to live)
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live (We were meant to live)
We were meant to live

13718,Outside,Foo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
There you are dancin' at your altar
Beautiful earthling, dressed in kashmir
All your sound echoes through the canyons
Down below they're dreamin', hear the sirens screamin'
Another time, another world, girls were boys and boys were girls
Find the glitter in the litter
Like a haunt, it's got to move, everybody needs some room
There's something out there

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me

[Verse 2]
All I found, space between the spaces
Standin' in the nothing, and time reclaims you
And as the wind will beat you down, and the wind the only sound
There's something out there

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me

13739,Schism,TOOL,"[Verse 1]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

[Bridge]
The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

[Verse 2]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

[Bridge]
The poetry that comes from
The squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

[Verse 3]
There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second-guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

[Bridge]
Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers

[Outro]
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
And I know the pieces fit

Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch

Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down
Don't hold me up now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry and the cold
We are the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told (Oh, oh, oh)
But we've been sweating while you slept so calm in the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up everything you've known

[Chorus]
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down
Don't hold me up now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Pardon me while I burst
Pardon me while I burst

[Verse 1]
A decade ago, I never thought I would be
At 23 on the verge of spontaneous combustion, woe is me
But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never-ending calamity

I need you to hear, I need you to see
That I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility
To me

[Chorus]
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Not two days ago, I was having a look
In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, ""I can relate,"" 'cause lately, I've been
Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from
The burdens of the planet Earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy and the perils of being in 3D
But thinking so much differently

[Chorus]
Pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same
Never be the same, yeah

Pardon me while I burst into flames
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me

That I will never, ever choose to be

Oh, so many ways for me to show you
How your savior has abandoned you

Fuck your God
Your Lord, your Christ, He did this
Took all you had and left you this way
Still you pray, you never stray, you never
Never taste of the fruit
Never thought to question why

It's not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side
Praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed
He did it all for you
He did it all for you

Oh, so many ways for me to show you
How your dogma has abandoned you

[Verse 2]
Pray to your Christ, to your God
Never taste of the fruit
Never stray, never break never
Choke on a lie!
Even though He's the one who did this to you
Never thought to question why

[Chorus]
Not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side
Talk to Jesus Christ as if He knows the reasons why
He did it all for you, oh
He did it all for you, woah

Changing gear I pull you tighter to me

I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out

We're the empty set just floating through empty skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

Rollin' in my ride
Chillin all alone

We used to drive down to the water at night
Set fire to driftwood and then‚ÄÖlaugh‚ÄÖtill we cry
Drunk‚ÄÖoff them cheap beers that we‚ÄÖused to buy, used to buy
What I'd give to go back in time

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm tryna keep a young heart
But I'm only getting older
Tryna keep those nights so fresh in my veins
Never in a million years
Did I think that it'd be over
Then it's like I'm floating away

[Chorus]
What I'd give
To go back, to go back again
What I'd give
To know that we both felt the same
'Cause it's hard moving on knowing all that our love has wasted away
What I'd give to go back again

[Verse 2]
For just a moment we were hand in hand
Went for a kiss that I was nervous to land
I didn't mean to spill your drink in the sand
Oh, what I'd give to go back again

But I'm only getting older

44th and 8th could no longer find my way
Instantly I felt the pain
A good friend asks what's wrong
Words couldn't leave my tongue
Oh I have seen better days
""Move on, move on, be strong, be strong"" they say
Don't miss what lies ahead, the change, the change

[Chorus]
So where can I go, to get over you?
Fast forward and know, I'll get over you
Your voice keeps running though my head
Running though my head, running though my head
I'd seen another way but I can't find the exit

[Verse 2]
End the night of Berlin
Drown myself in more gin, lose myself in base
Ride the train as memories fade
As we give each other space
Try to move on, move on, be strong, be strong like they say
Embrace the change what lies ahead

[Chorus]
So where can I go, to get over you?
Fast forward and know, I'll get over you
Everything moves in slow motion
But too quick to give you what I wanted
And now I can't get over you
How do I know I'll get over you?
Your voice keeps running though my head
Running though my head, running though my head
Seen another way but I can't find the exit

You had me under your spell
And I let you under my cell
The words you said under your breath
As my fingers ran under your head

Flying by
Sail away and watch the people down on Sunset and Five
Getting high

[Pre-Chorus]
And all my years of worry
And all the things I've done
Will turn right into water, like snowflakes in the sun

[Chorus]
If I had a wish
I'd wanna be your blackbird up in the sky
Fly you high

[Bridge]
And every time I close my eyes
I'll be there with you (there with you)
Out of this world and out my mind
Swear I'm going to (go with you)

[Chorus]
If I had a wish
I'd wanna be your blackbird up in the sky
Fly you high

[Outro]
And all my years of worry
And all the things I've done
Will turn right into water, like snowflakes in the sun
If I had a wish
I'd wanna be your blackbird up in the sky
Fly you high

13764,Moment,Sander W.,"We've been together
We've been apart
But it's never over
No matter where we are
And sometimes when I‚ÄÖdream‚ÄÖof you
When I‚ÄÖdream of you
It feels like you‚ÄÖcan see me too

We just need a moment
Breaking through the‚Åüfrozen
Rip‚Åüback‚Åüwhat they've stolen
Underneath‚Åüthe ice
We just‚Åüneed a moment
Digging out the rumors(?)
With our arms wide open
Aiming for the sky

And we light the fi-fi-fire (x8)
And we light the fi-

We've been in sunshine
We've been in rain
The only one thing higher
Is ____???
And sometimes when I dream of you
When I dream of you
It feels like you can see me too

We just need a moment
Breaking through the frozen
Rip back what they've stolen
Underneath the ice
We just need a moment
Digging out the rumors(?)
With our arms wide open
Aiming for the sky

And we light the fi-fi-fire (x8)

Twisty top of your fuckin' neck, meet ya Maker
Watchin' your mother cry bring me joy like Anita Baker (Hahaha)
My demons is evil by nature (Right)
Black talents out the Jeep; make you kiss the street (Pussy)
My favourite bitch is shootin', she bussin' then twist the leaf (Pff)
She hit the DM and meet 'em and leave 'em restin' in pieces, the bitch is lethal, I never leave her
Niggas talkin' like hustlers, I don't believe 'em (I Don't)
You n–µver had coke on your fingertips unl–µss you sniffin' it
I spray, that's a tone under package, made me a dummy brick
The price too good to be true, truth
I bust it open on the only corner where real COAF can food you (Hahaha)
Uh, niggas to gullible, my attitude combustable
Combined with the fact that this fourty-five-inch'll bust at you
Listen, I got no proper visitin'  where you live in I'm touchin' you (Boom)
A quick five will have the worst niggas alive discussin' you (Uh)

[Verse 2: Mickey Diamond & Scott G]
Yo, I'm too familar with bank departments, O'‚Äì (Diamond)
Ol' blue byes, my nigga, no Frank Sinatra
We still breakin' records like Curry on the court
Now tell us what you love more, the money or the sport?
Crossover, fade away it, I Micheal J. it (He's on fire!)
Stove still broke, we cook in the mircrowave, I might complain, I'm still blessed, I kill a mic a day
Run your jewels and keep tools like the NRA
I pop the steel and leave you stucked with doctor bills (Boom)
The coupe got the roof missin', like Dr. Phil, uh
We was youngans lookin' for a pipe to steal
Now these little niggas lookin' for a block to drill
It's‚Äì, it's danger in the field, no Rodney
RIP little Ronnie, it still feel funny
Niggas wasn't even twenty, fuck it, get money and be cool Before these niggas fuck around and turn your lights out, uh

[Outro: Scott G & Mickey Diamond]
Hahaha
Niggas talkin' like hustlers, I‚Äì (Had niggas scared to bring they ice out)

13762,Tired,Alan Walker,"[Intro]
I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

[Verse 1]
Cold hands, red eyes
Packed two bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

[Chorus]
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you when your heart is tired

[Verse 2]
When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don‚Äôt talk
And if they could, they‚Äôd say
Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

[Chorus]
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you when your heart is tired

I know those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

It may be too obvious but can't you see
You take me to places, I don't wanna leave

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh

[Chorus]
When it hits me in slow motion
Then it's right where I belong
It runs deeper than an ocean
Now we've only just begun
When I'm underneath the surface
Will you ever let me go?
This could be better, stronger, deeper than

[Verse 2]
And when I turn on the lights I realise that we meet
Thinking and dreaming of what it could be
Losing myself on the breath in between
The minute you stay and the second you leave

Then it's right where I belong
It runs deeper than an ocean
Now we've only just begun
When I'm underneath the surface

13765,Wishing Well,Sam Feldt,"[Verse 1]
She drips diamonds like a glacier melts
She's self-made, down to her buckles and belts
And she's really happy, but not with a lot
And she gets her pleasures from her chemist shop

[Pre-Chorus]
She's busy, busy losing the plot
Busy, but her mind is shut
Doesn't really want it to stop
She just says now

[Chorus]
Hey there, sister
That bottle leads to hell
I ain't drinking that
Honey, can't you tell
Jump while they're swimming, this ship is sinking
Got no soul to sell, so
Hey there, mister
Throw some luck away to the wishing well
Throw some luck away to the wishing well

[Verse 2]
Don't start thinking, it messes with your head
Go with instincts, the sweet or the dead
True love is out there, it's waiting with a ring
You'll know her face the second she walks in

[Pre-Chorus]
He's busy, busy losing the plot
Busy, but his mind is shut
He doesn't really want it to stop
He just says now

Hey there, sister

Honey, can't you tell
Jump while they're swimming, this ship is sinking
Got no soul to sell, so
Hey there, mister
Throw some luck away to the wishing well
Throw some luck away to the wishing well

Hey there, sister

Honey, can't you tell
Jump while they're swimming, this ship is sinking
Got no soul to sell, so

Anywhere you go, I've followed you anywhere

I should cry but my blue eyes are dry
I'm dying inside but i'm still alive
He has give me signs
But i'm a blind
Is he looking at me
Or the girl behind
My mind is in knots

Be mine, this time

With no one else
He's thinking of me
When he is by himself
Would he love me more
If i look away and play his game

Damn I feel so insecure
Should be moving on by now

Stuck on you, stuck on you

Cuz I know you ain't the one
I am wasting all my time
Deep inside I know you can't be mine
And baby that's alright

Oooooh
Slowly realise you will never be mine

To start
I saw you with your friends, I approached
Under the pretext of inviting you to dance

Waking up to kisses, pleasing you in my bed

Cuatro mil razones hoy nos sobran
Para terminar con este estr√©s
Dosis de amor hac√≠an falta
Pero ninguno cedi√≥

De una relaci√≥n que no da para m√°s

Ahora soy la pieza en tu rompecabezas
Que nunca hizo falta, que no encajar√°
Voy a enumerar todos nuestros errores
Cuando llegue a cero todo acabar√°

[Verso 1]
Diez - nunca me dices que me amas
Nueve - siempre cambio la verdad
Ocho - cuando salgo de la casa
Siete - casi siempre llego a las
Seis - no me agradan tus detalles
Cinco - a esta altura nos da igual
Cuatro - se nos apago la llama
Tres - casi voy a terminar
Dos - si no hay amor, no hay nada
Es oportuno el adi√≥s

Sabor aqui esta la salsa
Con changa y rap que es mucho mejor
Y le trai la historia de una mamita en television

De que su palanca fuera su cuerpo y no su valor

Amo al ejecutivo de arte dramatico lo embrujo
Moviendo el trasero poquito a poco lo conquisto
Y asi fue la estrella mas destacada dentro del show
Fallo no pudo en la esena donde habia llanto pues no lloro

13819,Almost Mine,Wankelmut,"[Verse 1]
Waiting up again, I'm always tired
Give it up and watch me go
It wasn't always just a midnight fire
You used to call me on the road

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of love, yeah, I know you decided
Hurry up, make me feel what you don't
Come around and then you take what you want and then go
Just go

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna feel it every time
No, I don't, that feeling that you almost fine
No, I don't wanna feel it every time
'Cause I know, you were almost mine
Give it up and watch me give up and watch me go
You were almost mine
Give it up and watch me give up and watch me go
You were almost mine

[Verse 2]
It was beautiful, the way we started
Said it can't be like before
I don't wanna be the only one who's calling
Can't make you feel me anymore

Hurry up, make me feel what you don't
Come around and then you take what you want and then go

13835,Me Tengo Que Ir,Adolescent's Orquesta,"[Letra de ""Persona Ideal""]

[Verso 1]
Me enamor√© de la persona ideal
Pero a la vez, se tuvo que ir
Ay, es que el dolor que desgarr√≥ toda mi alma y coraz√≥n
Para vivir de los recuerdos de este amor
Cuando agarrados de la mano, en el parque nos besamos
Y las l√°grimas ca√≠an en los p√©talos de rosa
Y tristemente me dijiste as√≠

[Coro]
Me tengo que ir
Y no es por m√≠, contigo est√° mi coraz√≥n
Todo el amor de mis entra√±as
De mi pecho y de mi alma
Alg√∫n d√≠a volver√© a estar aqu√≠
Me tengo que ir
As√≠ es la vida y tiene desilusi√≥n
Se tiene amor y hay esperanza
Cuando se quiere con el alma
Al pr√≥jimo que Dios te puso all√≠

[Verso 2]
Lleg√≥ otro amor de una persona ideal
Pero tambi√©n se tuvo que ir
Ay, es que el dolor que hab√≠a en su vientre
Un ni√±o estaba presente
Y en sus cartas me dec√≠a que alguien perder√≠a la vida
Y tristemente me escribi√≥ as√≠

[Coro]
Me tengo que ir
Y no es por m√≠, contigo est√° mi coraz√≥n
Todo el amor de mis entra√±as
De mi cuerpo y de mi alma
Todo el fruto de este amor te queda a ti
Me tengo que ir, ir, ir
Se tiene amor y hay esperanza
Cuando se quiere con esperanza
Al pr√≥jimo que Dios te puso all√≠, all√≠

[Instrumental]
Eh

[Refr√°n]
Me tengo que ir
Y no es por m√≠
Contigo est√° mi coraz√≥n
Si te quiero con el alma
Me tengo que ir
¬øPor qu√© tienen que separar?
Contigo est√° mi coraz√≥n
El amor de mis entra√±as

[Instrumental]

[Refr√°n]
Me tengo que ir, contigo est√° mi coraz√≥n
Me entregu√© en cuerpo y alma
Me tengo que ir
Ya no estar√°s m√°s en mi vida
Contigo est√° mi coraz√≥n
Triste el adi√≥s, triste tu partida
Me tengo que ir
Me tengo que ir
Contigo est√° mi coraz√≥n
Y te amar√© toda la vida
Me tengo que ir
Es la verdad de una pasi√≥n cuando se entrega el coraz√≥n
Me tengo que ir

13821,Set The World,Flatdisk,"[Verse 1]
It's criminal, the thoughts inside your head
When you're fast asleep
Crimes you've committed from your bed
You've set the world on fire once, didn't you
You've set the world on fire once

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a tragedy, waiting for the light to change
On an empty street, driving you insane
You wanna set the world on fire, don't you?
You wanna set the world

Rain falls, water is rising
Gotta, night crawls, darkness is rising
Gotta keep your head above it
Keep your head above it, your head above it

[Hook]
Rain falls, water is rising
Gotta, night crawls, darkness is rising
Gotta keep your head above it
Keep your head above it

[Verse 2]
You want a remedy to relieve you of your doubts
And set behind all the things you can't live without
You've set the world on fire once, didn't you?
You've set the world on fire once

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a tragedy, waiting for the light to change
On an empty street, driving you insane
You wanna set the world on fire, don't you?
You wanna set the world

Rain falls, water is rising
Gotta, night crawls, darkness is rising
Gotta keep your head above it
Keep your head above it, your head above it

13801,Fireproof,Coleman Hell,"[Verse 1]
Did you know me and you
Must be fireproof with all the hell that we've been through
When all our lovin' lost its charm
Learned to make a shelter out in the storm (Hey)
Made it out of the cold
Climbed a mountain and I stepped on burning coals
When all our lovin' fell apart
Someone left the light on out in the dark

[Chorus]
You and I, we've both been through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire, feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof
We'll be fireproof

[Verse 2]
Did you know you and me
Must be fireproof with all these flames between our sheets
When all our lovin' was almost gone
Made some in the moonlight, yeah, before the dawn (Hey)
Made it out of the heat
Crossed the desert and we sailed the seven seas
When all our lovin' felt so wrong
Found out all the hard times just made us strong

[Chorus]
You and I, we've both been through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire, feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof
Fireproof
We'll be fireproof
Fireproof

[Outro Chorus]
You and I, we've both been through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire, feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof

13815,Running Out,Matoma,"[Intro: Matoma]
I was thinking about the day we met
When the love came rushing out and you were empty-handed filled with regret
I was thinking about the day we met
When the love came rushing out and you were empty-handed filled with regret

[Verse 1: J-Wright]
(Yuh, Uh)
You ain't leaving my side
Girl I knew that when I met you I just keep that in mind
Swear she got me so lost watching her taking it off
Got me so love sick for you and be hearing me cough
I'm mixing liquor with love
Steady living it up
And they all see me do good watch 'em hittin' me up
Turing nothing to somethin'
You should be constantly frontin'
Now you all up in my phone sayin' my new song is bumpin'
It's hard work
And i still been taking like no breaks
Go play, all my new songs, got me up so late
Trying to write the perfect lyrics but you're too hard to describe
As I'm all up on that body girl you got me so alive
Yeah, you gotta leave I don't want you to go
Swear we're moving so fast but still be feeling to slow
I could rap a thousand words
I could make a hundred rhymes
But nothing would matter if you weren't here by my side
Lets go

[Hook: Matoma]
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes

[Verse 2: J-Wright]
Forgetting all the stress though
Let loose summer time baby lets go
Crack a bottle while we underneath the stars
Reminiscing on the memories we made it so far
Yeah even if call girl I ain't gonna answer
The way you move those hips I swear you were a dancer (nah)
Used to be chilling just on occasions
Now every weekend feeling like a vacation
Girl got me patient got me looking like that
Try and drift away but you coming right back
We living with no regrets
I'm this right here my past
Everything I'm working to is closer with every breath
And I keep breathing like I'm working it out
If your looking at my views I bet it's hurting your doubt
I could rap a thousand words
I could make a hundred rhymes
Nothing would matter if you weren't here by my side
Lets go

[Hook: Matoma]
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes

(Our love is running, our love is running)

13813,Safe and Sound,NLSN,"[Verse 1]
I'm floating in a sea of troubles
With a pocket full of dreams
I can see the black clouds arising
But they just bring a gentle breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
You're always there to guide me through
I've got no fear when I'm with you
No summer storm can bring us down
Together, we'll be safe and sound

[Chorus]
We'll be safe and sound
We'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2]
I'm dancing on a back alley
Shaking off my inner fears
I can feel you right behind me
And that is all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
You're always there to guide me through
I've got no fear when I'm with you
No summer storm can bring us down
Together, we'll be safe and sound

We'll be safe and sound
We'll be safe and sound

Don't waste your time on me
Don't waste your time on me
Don't waste your time on me

Sand beneath my toes
I feel at ease
Tide creeping in with that summer breeze

Finally I can breath
While in the winter times
I will leave to follow that summertime breeze

Darling, you can't stay here
Come with me
How can you resist that summer breeze?

13843,El Gran Varon,Willie Col√≥n,"[Letra de ""El Gran Var√≥n""]

[Intro]
En la sala de un hospital, a las 9:43 naci√≥ Sim√≥n
Es el verano del '56, el orgullo de Don Andr√©s, por ser var√≥n
Fue criado como los dem√°s
Con mano dura, con severidad, nunca opin√≥
""Cuando crezcas vas a estudiar la misma vaina que tu pap√°
√ìyelo bien, tendr√°s que ser un gran var√≥n""

[Verso 1]
Al extranjero se fue Sim√≥n
Lejos de casa se le olvid√≥ aquel serm√≥n
Cambi√≥ la forma de caminar
Usaba falda, lapiz labial, y un carter√≥n
Cuenta la gente que un d√≠a el pap√°
Fue a visitarlo sin avisar, ¬°vaya qu√© error!
Y una mujer le habl√≥ al pasar
Le dijo: ""Hola, ¬øqu√© tal, pap√°? ¬øc√≥mo te va?
¬øNo me conoces? Yo soy Sim√≥n
Sim√≥n, tu hijo, el gran var√≥n""

[Preg√≥n]
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jam√°s su tronco endereza
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jam√°s su tronco endereza
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jam√°s su tronco endereza

[Verso 2]
Se dej√≥ llevar por lo que dice la gente
Su padre jam√°s le habl√≥, lo abandon√≥ para siempre
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jam√°s su tronco endereza
Y no te quejes, Andr√©s, no te quejes por nada
Si del cielo te caen limones, aprende a hacer limonada

[Verso 3]
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jam√°s su tronco endereza
Y mientras pasan los a√±os, el viejo cediendo un poco
Sim√≥n ya ni le escrib√≠a, Andr√©s estaba furioso
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jam√°s su tronco endereza
Por fin hubo noticia de d√≥nde su hijo estaba
Andr√©s nunca olvid√≥ el d√≠a de esa triste llamada

[Puente]
A-le-le-lelele, a-le-lelele
A-lelele-lele
A-le-le-lelele, a-le-lelele
A-lelele-lele

En la sala de un hospital
De una extra√±a enfermedad, muri√≥ Sim√≥n
Es el verano del '86
Al enfermo de la cama 10 nadie llor√≥
Sim√≥n, Sim√≥-√≥-√≥-√≥-√≥-√≥-√≥-√≥n, Sim√≥n

[Verso 4]
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jam√°s su tronco endereza
Hay que tener compasi√≥n, basta ya de moraleja
El que est√© libre de pecado que tire la primera piedra
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jam√°s su tronco endereza
El que nunca perdona tiene destino cierto
De vivir amargos recuerdos en su propio infierno
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jam√°s su tronco endereza

Take it slowly
'Cause it feels like time has got something to show me
Through a crowded room, look at me like you know me
Ain't it funny how a second last forever, when we're together?
And I might get enough one day
But I won't let this feeling fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change? We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever
I'll make you stay

[Chorus]
Don't let this feeling fade away
Don't let this feeling fade away

[Verse 2]
Don't you hurry
I will show you all the treasures that I've bury
Try to hide but you just always see right through me
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But you're the reason that I'm not leaving

I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change? We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever
I'll make you stay

Let me come home to you, let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too

Worldwide, baby
Y yo aqu√≠ pensando que t√∫ eres bonita
Ay, creo que si lo intento puedo enamorarte (Puedo enamorarte)
No es casualidad que te tenga cerquita (Ayayayayay)
A poca distancia pa' poder besarte (¬°Maluma!)

[Pre-Coro: Maluma & Silvestre Dangond]
T√≥came, yo s√© que nos gustamo', no digas que no
Siente con tu mano lo que siento hoy
Esta es muy real, que esta te va a gustar
Y es verdad
Que no he sido un santo y tampoco el peor
Si he sido un mujeriego es por falta de amor
Pero eso con tus brazo' se podr√≠a cambiar (Directo al cuarto)

[Coro: Silvestre Dangond & Maluma]
Y yo quiero vivir bailando la vida contigo (Wuuh)
Y todo el tiempo vivir en tus brazo'
Y caminar por el mundo, descalzo (Ayayayay)
Y yo quiero vivir bailando la vida contigo (-tigo)
Y que tengamo' los hijo' que quiera' (Ay)
T√∫ dime si a ti te gusta la idea (Okey)

[Post-Coro: Maluma & Silvestre Dangond]
Si t√∫ quiere', mamacita, que tengamo' varios hijos para m√≠ es mejor, para m√≠ es mejor (Dale, c√°ntala; s√≠, bailot√©ala)
Porque as√≠ yo vivir√≠a solamente practic√°ndolo contigo amor, contigo amor (Ja)
Y si t√∫ quiere', mamacita, que tengamo' varios hijos para m√≠ es mejor, para m√≠ es mejor
Porque as√≠ yo vivir√≠a solamente practic√°ndolo contigo amor (Contigo amor)

Vamos a la pr√°ctica, no seas timida (Okey)
Quiero conocerte en la intimidad (-timidad)
Hag√°moslo muy lento, despacio (Eeh-eeh)
Con tus caricia' quiero llegar al espacio (¬°Dile!)
Soy tu sugar daddy, y t√∫ eres mi mami (Wuh)
Por toda la habitaci√≥n haremos un safari (-fari)
Algo ex√≥tico, er√≥tico
Prometo va a ser magn√≠fico (No, no; yeah-eh)
Y v√°monos de fuga (Yeah-eh)
Donde nadie nos vea (Yeah-eh)
Y nos vamo' pa' Urumita (Yeah-eh)
Ay, que esa tierra es bonita

[Coro: Maluma & Silvestre Dangond]
¬°Y! Yo quiero vivir bailando la vida contigo (Ayayay)

13826,La Mejor Versi√≥n de Mi,Natti Natasha,"[Letra de ""La Mejor Versi√≥n de M√≠""]

[Verso 1]
La mejor versi√≥n de m√≠, no la conociste t√∫
Porque siempre me frenaste con tu p√©sima actitud
Nunca pude ser quien era por amarte a tu manera
Me olvid√© hasta de ser yo

[Verso 2]
La mejor versi√≥n de m√≠, est√° a punto de llegar
Porque estoy recuperando toda mi seguridad
Esa que me arrebataste con tus celos sin sentido
Con tu forma de pensar

[Pre-Coro 1]
Pero me lleg√≥ el momento y quise ser m√°s fuerte
Y ahora estoy tan convencida que no debo verte
Que perd√≠ mi tiempo mientras t√∫ ganabas
Porque valgo mucho m√°s de lo que imaginabas

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy aqu√≠, disfrutando la mejor versi√≥n de m√≠

[Pre-Coro 2]
Y porque hoy que no te tengo, tengo tantas cosas
Ahora empiezo a disfrutar un poco m√°s las rosas
Por fa', no me insistas, tampoco lo intentes
Si ya s√© que nunca cumples lo que me prometes

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy aqu√≠, disfrutando la mejor versi√≥n de m√≠

[Outro]
No te toca a ti disfrutar de la mejor versi√≥n de m√≠

[Intro]
Uuuuh
No
No, no, no, no

[Verso 1]
Yo no s√© si t√∫, no s√© si yo
Seguiremos siendo como hoy
No s√© si despu√©s de amanecer
Vamos a sentir la misma sed
Para qu√© pensar y suponer
No preguntes cosas que no s√©, yo no s√©
No s√© d√≥nde vamos a parar
Eso ya la piel nos lo dir√°
¬øPara qu√© jurar y prometer algo que no est√° en nuestro poder?
Yo no s√© lo que es eterno
No me pidas algo que es del tiempo

[Coro]
Yo no s√© ma√±ana, yo no s√© ma√±ana
Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo
Yo no s√© si soy para ti, si ser√°s para m√≠
Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos
Yo no s√© ma√±ana, yo no s√© ma√±ana qui√©n va a estar aqu√≠

[Verso 2]
De un cafe pasamos al sof√°
De un bot√≥n a todo lo dem√°s
No pusimos reglas ni reloj
Aqu√≠ estamos solos t√∫ y yo
Todo lo que ves es lo que soy
No me pidas m√°s de lo que doy, no

[Coro]
Yo no s√© ma√±ana, yo no s√© ma√±ana
Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo
Yo no s√© si soy para ti, si ser√°s para m√≠

Yo no s√© ma√±ana, yo no s√© ma√±ana qui√©n va a estar aqu√≠

Esta vida es igual que un libro, cada pagina es un d√≠a vivido
No tratemos de correr antes de andar
Esta noches estamos vivos, solo este momento es realidad
No, oh, no, no s√©, oh

Yo no s√© ma√±ana
Esta vida es una ruleta que gira sin parar
Yo no s√© ma√±ana
Yo no s√© si t√∫, yo no s√© si yo, c√≥mo ser√° el final
Yo no s√© ma√±ana
Puede ser peor, o puede ser mejor
Yo no s√© ma√±ana
Deja que el coraz√≥n decida, vida m√≠a, lo que sentimos
Ma√±ana, yo no s√©
Yo no s√©, yo no s√© ma√±ana
Ahora lo que vivimos es algo realmente lindo
Qui√©n puede saber lo que pasar√° ma√±ana, no hay nada escrito
Yo no s√©, yo no s√© ma√±ana
Estamos solos t√∫ y yo
Y los momentos hay que vivirlos, hay que vivirlos
¬°Oye!
Yo no s√©, yo no s√©
Yo no s√©, yo no s√©

Yo te ando buscando como un loco por el mundo
Y sin ti ya no aguanto un segundo
Alguien venga, d√≠gamelo ya
Si la han visto por aqu√≠ o la han visto por all√°
Porque la busco, yo la busco y no la encuentro
Ya yo quiero que llegue ese momento
En que yo le pueda decir
Que sin ti, mi vida, no puedo vivir

Y que me llenes de besitos y m√°s
Porque eres t√∫ la nena que quiero yo (Oh-oh)

[Verso 2]
La ando buscando por los siete mares
Debajo de las piedras y en mil lugares
Alguien venga, d√≠gamelo ya
Si la han visto por aqu√≠ o la han visto por all√°

No s√© la hora, el d√≠a, ni el momento
Si alguien sabe, d√≠gamelo ya
Si ha pasado un a√±o, un siglo o una eternidad

Que venga alguien y me lo diga
Si la ha visto yo lo quiero, lo quiero, lo quiero
Porque yo quiero-

[Verso 4]
Yo quiero, yo quiero, yo quiero tu cari√±ito aqu√≠
Te busco por el mundo y no te puedo conseguir
Navego por los mares sin poder hallarte
Que anhelo ese gran d√≠a que pueda encontrarte

Porque yo quiero que me llenes de besitos

[Intro]
¬°Opa!

[Verso 1]
Te quiero as√≠, deliciosa, insospechada
Porque creo en tu palabra
Porque yo siento que a√∫n te necesito
Porque me alteras las ganas
Te quiero as√≠, estruendosa y delicada
Entre alegr√≠a y nostalgia
Porque me gusta tenerte, vida m√≠a
Y no quiero que te vayas
Porque el amor, cuando es verdad sale del alma
Nos aturde los sentidos
Y de pronto descubrimos que la piel se enciende en llamas

[Coro]
Bien, tu amor me hace bien
Tu amor me desarma
Ay, tu amor me controla
Eh, eh-eoh, me endulza, me encanta
Eh, eh, pero bien, tu amor me hace bien
Tu amor me desarma
Ay, tu amor me controla
Eh, eh-eoh, me vence, me amarra, eh, eh
Mira que me hace bien, ay, que me hace bien

[Verso 2]
Te quiero as√≠, tan precisa, equivocada
Con tus detalles que matan
Porque tenerte a mi lado me hace fuerte
Si eres mi reina y mi espada
Te quiero as√≠, cuando r√≠es, cuando callas
Porque al caer, me levantas
Porque mi voz y mi esp√≠ritu se agitan
Cuando dices que me amas
Porque tu amor, como es verdad me vuelve el alma
Me despierta los sentidos
Y de pronto descubr√≠ que aqu√≠ en mi piel se enciende en llamas

[Coro]
Ay, bien, tu amor me hace bien
Tu amor me desarma
Ay, tu amor me controla

[Verso 1]
Si huele a ca√±a tabaco y brea
Uste' est√° en Cali, ay mire vea!
Si las mujeres son lindas y hermosas
Aqu√≠ no hay fea para que vea

Mi Cali se est√° adornando para su fiesta m√°s popular
Con ca√±a dulce el melao hierve en la paila hasta amanecer
Habr√° corrida de toros y por la noche fiesta y rumba
En Cali mir√°, se sabe gozar
En Cali mir√°, se sabe gozar

De d√≠a su sol ardiente hace que mi Cali se caliente
De noche sus callecitas con farolitos se ven bonitas
Afinen bien las orquestas que este a√±o si vamo' a reventar
La rumba empez√≥ en la sexta y vamo' a Juanchito es a rematar

Con salsa de aqu√≠, con mucho man√≠
Con salsa de aqu√≠, con mucho man√≠

[Estribillo]
Oiga mire vea, v√©ngase a Cali para que vea
Oiga mire vea, goce la feria para que vea
Si uste' va llegando v√°yase entonando
Que de baile en baile se va acomodando
De d√≠a en la plaza corrida de toros
De noche casetas sin hembras, ni modo

Oiga mire vea, v√©ngase a Cali para que vea
Si va uste' a Juanchito la pasa bonito
Si va al barrio obrero se vuelve rumbero
Si se me acalora, no mire la hora
T√≥mese un raspao' y cuento acabao

Oiga mire vea, goce la feria para que vea
Aqu√≠ no hay problema, aqu√≠ no hay pelea
Mi gente de Cali disfruta y rumbea
Pida una botella pida una caneca
Que en mi Cali bella mi gente respeta

Oiga mire vea, vengase a Cali para que vea
Vaya despacito si ya va prendido
Si va manejando, se mete en un l√≠o
Qu√©dese quietico, ya est√° amanecido
Y despu√©s de canse, v√°yase pa' Pance

[Estribillo 2]

Oiga mire vea, v√©ngase a Cali para que vea
Oiga mire vea, goce la feria para que vea
Oiga mire vea, v√©ngase a Cali para que vea
Oiga mire vea, goce la feria para que vea

[Verso final]

Qu√© qu√© qu√© qu√© qu√©
Quer√≠an que te cantara
Cali te canto y te cantar√©
Despu√©s que pasa la feria
La rumba sigue como es
As√≠ queda demostrado
Y aqu√≠ queda comprobado
Que las mujeres de Cali tienen sabrosura
Salsa
Porque mueven la cintura
Las mujeres de Cali tienen sabrosura
Salsa
Porque mueven la cintura

Miro tus ojos y no eres feliz
Y tu mirada no sabe mentir

No eres el mismo y me tratas mal
Y ante mi dios te podr√≠a jurar
Cuanto te quise y te quiero todav√≠a

Me voy de ti
Esta vez para siempre
Me ir√© sin marcha atr√°s porque ser√≠a fatal

El amor de tu vida
Lo dijiste una vez, me lo hiciste creer
Como me duele perderte
Me resignar√© a olvidarte
Porque me fallaste

Si no tiene caso continuar as√≠
Mejor me voy
Me voy de ti

Para qu√© voy a mentir
Si no me amas es mejor partir
Y de una vez concluir
Con este mal que me agobia
Con este amor que me quiere destruir

Adi√≥s Amor
Me voy de ti
Esta vez para siempre
Me ir√© sin marcha atr√°s porque ser√≠a fatal
Adi√≥s Amor

13890,Como la Manigua,Yuri Buenaventura,"[Letra de ""La √öltima Bala"" ft. The Latin Brothers]

[Verso 1: Yuri Buenaventura, The Latin Brothers]
Vamos caminando vamos avanzando
El sol de un d√≠a nuevo nos va iluminando
Rostros desconocidos, un dolor no merecido
Llevamos una luz que apagar, nadie ha podido
Rostros de mi gente rostros sencillos
Y juntos decimos ante nadie me humillo
Nada nos detiene ninguna presi√≥n
A nada le teme a esta gran naci√≥n

[Pre-Coro 1: Yuri Buenaventura]
Vendr√°n terremotos, corruptos y mafiosos
Hombres o mujeres, ya no hay miedosos

[Coro: Yuri Buenaventura, The Latin Brothers]
Se mata la gente, pero no las almas
Mi patria no cae tropieza o resbala
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara
Mi patria no cae pero no las almas
Tropieza o resbala tropieza o resbala
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara
Se mata la gente, pero no las almas
Mi patria no cae tropieza o resbala
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara
Mi patria no cae pero no las almas
Tropieza o resbala tropieza o resbala
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara

[Verso 2: The Latin Brothers, Yuri Buenaventura]
Frente a la oscuridad inclemente de criminales mentes
Se levant√≥ mi gente y se limpi√≥ la cara
Aunque mi rostro es de barrio de techo de lata
Mi alma y mi esencia no la compras con plata
Una naci√≥n completamente maniatada
Entre narcotr√°fico y corrupci√≥n mi bandera secuestrada
Una patria como la m√≠a tropieza o resbala
Pero se pone de pie y se limpia la cara
Aunque tu seas el patr√≥n apunta bien tus armas
No sea que por justicia te toque la √∫ltima bala

[Pre-Coro 2: Yuri Buenaventura]
Mucha plata repartiste por los barrios
Convertiste a mis hermanos en sicarios
Que esta historia no se borre de tu mente
En honor a nuestros muertos que cayeron vilmente

[Coro: Yuri Buenaventura, The Latin Brothers]
Se mata la gente, pero no a las almas
Mi patria no cae tropieza o resbala
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara
Mi patria no cae pero no a las almas
Tropieza o resbala tropieza o resbala
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara
Se mata la gente, pero no a las almas
Mi patria no cae tropieza o resbala
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara
Mi patria no cae pero no a las almas
Tropieza o resbala tropieza o resbala
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara

Se pone de pie se limpia la cara
Se mata la gente, contar√© esta historia
Mi patria no cae, una y mil veces
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara no la borres de tu mente
Mi patria no cae por nuestros muertos
Tropieza o resbala que cayeron vilmente
Se pone de pie se limpia la cara

[Outro: Yuri Buenaventura]
¬°Nunca m√°s!
Que no se borre de tu mente
En honor a nuestros muertos que cayeron vilmente

13882,Vamos a Escapar,Alvaro Rod,"El d√≠a que yo me muera
Quiz√°s t√∫ me recuerdes
Por ser aquel muchacho
Que am√≥ a tu‚ÄÖcoraz√≥n
Sin‚ÄÖmiedo a los‚ÄÖdem√°s

Te d√≠ mi vida entera
Pero no‚ÄÖme arrepiento
Si te amo demasiado
Despu√©s de mil intentos
Me niego a‚Åürenunciar

Camina‚Åüconmigo,‚Åüvamos a escapar
Hazle‚Åücaso al destino,‚Åüno lo pienses m√°s
Que te puso en mi camino, cuando menos lo esperaba
S√© que tu tambi√©n me amas, vamos a escapar

Camina conmigo, vamos a escapar
Si este amor es prohibido, yo lo har√© legal
Lo que siento es verdadero, un amor puro y sincero
Eres lo que yo mas quiero, vamos a escapar

Ser√° contigo que yo me quiero fugar
Te llevar√© a un lugar que no podr√°n encontrar
Nadie podr√° con este amor verdadero
Demostrar√© que eres todo lo que quiero

No me importa lo que diga la gente
Yo te quiero en mi presente
Baby te pido que nos des una oportunidad
Hagamos juntos de este sue√±o una realidad

Camina conmigo, vamos a escapar
Si este amor es prohibido, yo lo har√© legal
Lo que siento es verdadero, un amor puro y sincero
Eres lo que yo mas quiero, vamos a escapar

Este amor es tan grande, que por ti dar√≠a la vida
Te pienso a cada instante, en la noche y en el d√≠a
Si quieren alejarme, donde vayas yo estar√≠a
Que yo a ti te seguir√≠a, para m√≠ a√∫n eres m√≠a

En tus sue√±os profundos, me apodero de tus besos
Cuento cada segundo, anhelando tu regreso
Y es que al verte me siento, como un ni√±o ilusionado
Quiero un mundo a tu lado, que de ti me he enamorado

Camina conmigo, vamos a escapar
Hazle caso al destino, no lo pienses m√°s
Que te puso en mi camino, cuando menos lo esperaba
S√© que tu tambi√©n me amas, vamos a escapar

Camina conmigo, vamos a escapar
Si este amor es prohibido, yo lo har√© legal
Lo que siento es verdadero, un amor puro y sincero
Eres lo que yo mas quiero, vamos a escapar

Vamos a escapar

Camina conmigo, a donde quieras te llevar√©
A donde sea contigo ir√©, conf√≠a ven conmigo
Camina conmigo, huyamos y que nadie nos encuentre
Que no te importe la gente, a donde vayas te sigo

Camina conmigo, lo que t√∫ quieras te voy a dar
S√≥lo contigo quiero estar

Fue imposible sacar tu recuerdo de mi mente
Fue imposible olvidar que algun dia yo te quice

Alexandra:
Tanto tiempo pas√≥ desde el dia que te fuiste
Ahi supe que las despedidas son muy tristes
Nunca me imagine que un tren se llevara en su viaje
Aquellas ilusiones que de ni√±os nos juramos
Todos tus sentimientos los guardaste en tu equipaje
Quiciste consolarme y me dijiste yo te amo

Desde entonces no supe que seria de tu vida
Desde entonces no supe si algun dia regresabas
Los amigos del pueblo preguntaron si volvias
Llorando di la espalda no les pude decir nada

Monchy:
Ayer que regres√© a mi pueblo
Aguien me dijo que ya te casaste
Mirame y dime si ya me olvidaste
Me marchar√© con los ojos aguados

Despues le pregunt√© a la luna
Me dio la espalda e intento ocultarse
Hasta la luna sabe que me amaste
Hasta la luna sabe que aun me amas

Y vuela vuela por otro rumbo
Ve y sue√±a sue√±a que el mundo es tuyo

Es tan triste tener que decirte que me olvides
Otro amor ha llegado a mi vida y no te quiero

Monchy:
Es muy tarde no puedo negarte que me muero
Pero no callaran mis palabras pa' decirte
Que so√±ar√© contigo siempre que cierre mis ojos
Que entonar√© por ti mis cantos tristes noche a noche
Que llorar√© sin ti cuando recuerde que estoy solo
Y al recordar que duermes en los brazos de otro hombre

Me pregunto si aun reflejas algo de mi vida
Si en tu memoria vive aquel amor de tantos a√±os
Aquel hombre que siempre te ha querido desde ni√±a
Que llora porque el amor de su vida se ha casado

Alexandra:
Es triste ver que un tren se aleja
Y en el se va lo mejor de tu vida
Dime el motivo de tu despedida
¬øPor que te fuiste dejando mil penas?

Un dia recibi tu carta
Quice leerla y era una hoja en blanco
Pues de tu vida nunca supe nada
Como preguntas que si aun te amo

Era mi mejor amiga
Si alguien viene y me lo cuenta
No lo creer√≠a, pero los vi

Ni por qu√© yo estaba ah√≠

Solo vivo para ti
Solo son ideas

Cuando tu mejor amiga te lo roba

Y te mienten en la cara

Esa noche yo los vi

¬øC√≥mo se perdona?
Qui√©n me quita ese recuerdo de mi mente
La confianza que se pierde ya no vuelve

Yo quisiera perdonarte
Pero ya mi coraz√≥n
No puede

Me doli√≥
No es lo que t√∫ piensas
Que t√∫ me enga√±aras
Es un malentendido

Un cristal cuando se rompe
Nunca m√°s puede volver
A como estaba, no se repara

13859,No Te Contaron Mal,You Salsa,"Letra de ""No Te Contaron Mal"" ft. Amy Gutierrez

Voy a contestarte ahora mismo
Todas tus preguntas
Pa' dejarte bien claro
Qu√© fue lo que pas√≥

La noche en que me dejaste
Pasaron cosas
Las mismas cosas que tu amigo
Ya te cont√≥
¬øY sabes qu√©?

No te contaron mal
No te voy a negar
Si nos besamos
Nos entregamos

Pero hasta ah√≠ nom√°s
Fueron unos cu√°ntos besos
Dos o tres caricias
Me gan√≥ el deseo

De que fuera mio
Hubo coqueteo
¬øY pues yo que hac√≠a?

No te contaron mal
Estuve con alguien m√°s
¬øQu√© te hace da√±o?
Si no fue en tu a√±o
¬øQu√© tienes que opinar?

Si no fueron muchas
Solo fue con uno
Si andaba de fiesta
Era culpa tuya

Y al final de cuentas
Uno no es ninguno
No te contaron mal

No te contaron mal
No te voy a negar
Si nos besamos
Nos entregamos
Pero hasta ah√≠ nom√°s
Fueron unos cu√°ntos besos

Dos o tres caricias
Me gan√≥ el deseo
De que fuera mio
Hubo coqueteo

¬øY pues yo que hac√≠a?
No te contaron mal
Si estuve con alguien m√°s
¬øQu√© te hace da√±o?

Si no fue en tu a√±o
¬øQu√© tienes que opinar?

Si no fueron muchos
Solo fue con uno
Si andaba de fiesta
Era culpa tuya
Y al final de cuentas
Uno no es ninguno
No te contaron mal

No te contaron mal
Nos besamos
Nos entregamos
Pero hasta ah√≠ nom√°s
Fueron unos cu√°ntos besos
Dos o tres caricias nada m√°s

No te contaron mal
Si nos besamos
Nos entregamos
Y me gan√≥ el deseo
Pero hasta ah√≠ nom√°s
De que podria ser mio
No te lo voy a negar

No te contaron mal
Nos besamos
Nos entregamos
Pero hasta ah√≠ nom√°s

¬øQu√© te hace da√±o?
Si no fue en tu a√±o
No tienes que opinar

You Salsa dice

No te contaron mal
Estuve con alguien m√°s
¬øQu√© te hace da√±o?
Si no fue en tu a√±o
¬øQu√© tienes que opinar?
Si no fueron muchos
Solo fue con uno

Si andaba de fiesta
Era culpa tuya
Y al final de cuentas
Uno no es ninguno
No te contaron mal

Ya no recuerdas mis locuras ni el amor aquel
Est√°s tranquila, lo mereces, siempre fuiste bien

Yo solamente fui la excusa para hacerle ver
Que t√∫ pod√≠as, si quer√≠as vivir sin su amor
Perd√≥name
No me di cuenta de ese juego y me enamor√©
Despu√©s fue tarde, no pod√≠a ya volver atr√°s

Al fin y al cabo un poquito yo me hice querer
Disc√∫lpame
Aquellos celos tan intensos que sent√≠ por ti
Estaba loco, casi loco, por aquel amor
Y al poco tiempo para siempre lo perd√≠

Pero del fuego que encendimos
Una vez queda el polvo

Que preparabas nada m√°s al atardecer
Y los censados que sol√≠amos tener
Por tonter√≠as

Que hacer con el
Hago proyectos que se mueren
Sin hacer
Es que la vida
No me va ni mal, ni bien
Sin tus caricias

Va teji√©ndose en mi lecho
Y al final quedo enredao'

[Puente]
Y cuando ve que resucito
Cuando enderezo la raz√≥n
Va calentando de a poquito
Y vuelve a quemar mi coraz√≥n

[Coro]
Que esa mujer e' fuego, fuego que me va quemando
Candela en su piel
Me consume poco a poco
Candela en su caminar
Y es que ella me hierve la raz√≥n
Candela en un cinturita
Loco loco loco sin la llave del candao
Candela
Fuego lento que me va quemando poco a poco
Candela en su piel
Eh! Que me quemo
Candela en su caminar
Eh! Que me quemo
Candela en su cinturita
Eh! Que me quemo
Waii!
('ci√≥n mami)

[Verso 2]
Como se form√≥ este incendio
Que me esta quemando campo adentro
Como se form√≥ este incendio
Que me esta quemando el Epipl√≥n
Va del norte de mi pecho
Por el sur de su cintura
Y acompa√±an mi despecho
Acordeones del Cibao

[Puente]
Y si ella ve que resucito
Si ve que salgo del fog√≥n
Se va acercando de a poquito
Y vuelve a quemar mi coraz√≥n

[Coro]
Que esa mujer e fuego, fuego que me va quemando
Candela en su piel
Me consume poco a poco
Candela en su caminar
Y es que ella me hierve la raz√≥n
Candela en un cinturita
Loco loco loco sin la llave del candao
Candela
Fuego lento que me va quemando poco a poco
Candela en su piel
Eh! Que me quemo
Candela en su caminar
Eh! Que me quemo
Candela en su cinturita
Eh! Que me quemo
Waii!

[Outro]
Que ella e' fuego que enciende mi canto
Candela!
Pero cuando busque de su calor me quemo
Candela!
Ay me quemo, way me quemo, que me quemo
Candela!
Y vuelvo a cae en la tentaci√≥n
Candela!
Que ella e fuego que quema mi canto
Candela!
Due√±a y se√±ora de mi sobresalto
Candela!
Wonononoo
Candela!
Fuego lento que me va quemando.. Wai
Candela!

13928,Siempre Tan Ron,Vicente Cifuentes,"Siempre te he dicho que te quiero
Siempre t√∫ has sido para m√≠
Una ventana y un consuelo
El pasaporte que perd√≠

Siempre te veo en lo que hago
Incluso cuando equivoqu√©
Le diste fuego a mi cigarro
Y yo no s√© si lo fum√©

Parece un mar
De fuego y mineral
Aprend√≠ a ver
Y a conocer tu soledad

Mi coraz√≥n
Tan malherido
Siempre tan ron
Como los vientos prometidos

Siempre que caigo demasiado
Hay algui–µn para contener
Estabas t√∫ en –µl otro lado
Cuando lo tuve que aprender

Por eso abr√°zame, y tranquilo
Tu mundo entero ya esta aqu√≠
El que te vino a dar asilo
Para ponerle punto al fin

Parece un mar
De fuego y mineral De fuego y mineral
Aprend√≠ a ver
Y a conocer mi soledad

Tan bienvenido  Tan bienvenido
Siempre tan ron

13901,Amor De Una Noche,N'Klabe,"Vaya N'Klabe
Ta pasando voltio
Mi pana mi pana te veo con la depre
Hermano tu sabes
Que pajo consul

{Hector:}

Ella me entrego su cuerpo
En una noche cualquiera
Luego abandono mi puerto
Como un barco de vela

{Felix:}

Ella me detuvo el alma
Fue un reloj sin manecillas
De repente estaba solo
Cuando amanecia

{Ricky:}

Todo se cambio esa noche
Hasta el color de las estrellas
Todo fue tan diferente por ella

Por que te fuiste (socio pero buscala) y no dejaste huella

{Felix:}

Me vuelvo triste

{Hector:}

No encuentro tu silueta

{Ricky:}

Desde la noche aquella

{Hector:}

Luz que se desaparece

{Felix:}

Amor que se va y no vuelve

{Ricky:}

Pero que me surge al alma
Como un fuego que crece

{Hector:}

Y yo te sigo so√±ando
Procurando que aparezca

{Felix:}

Ese amor que me hace falta
Ese amor que me alimenta

{Ricky:}

Todo se cambio esa noche
Hasta el color de las estrellas
Todo fue tan diferente por ella

Por que te fuiste (ven aca tu te quieres casar) ,y no dejaste huellas

{Felix:}

Me siento triste

{Hector:}

No encuentro tu silueta

{Ricky:}

Es como un sue√±o del
Que no quiero escapar
Y es que tu imagen no se pueda revelar

{voltio:}

Socio buscala dale perciguela si te la encuantras hablale bonito
Y convensela pero no pierdas tu orgullo de hombre
Si ya te la gosaste olvidala

{Band:}

Todo se cambio esa noche...hasta el color de las estrellas

{voltio:}

Te enamoro su figura, y en su aventura
Te dio de la que envisia o de la que enchula

{Band:}

Todo se cambio esa noche(que te pajo)hasta el color de las estrellas

{voltio:}

Hasta de color ya cambiaron las estrellas
Pero si no aparece papi olvidate de ella

{Band:}

Todo se cambio esa noche(voltios ya se fue)hasta el color de las estrellas(se me fue)

{voltio:}

Las mujeres de hoy en dia tienen muchas babillas
Te paso por encima y no le cojiste la tablilla

{Band:}

Todo se cambio esa noche(papi me dormi)hasta el color de las estrellas(me envolvi)

{voltio:}

Eso le pasa a cualquiera una ves me paso
Si ella no quiere dile que se lo perdio

Que pajo ma
Que pajo
El voltaje
N'klabe oiste
Y esto es N'klabe con el bandillaje
Pero dos
Y esto que te traigo esta N'klabe
Repitemelo voltio
Y esto que te traigo esta N'klabe

{Band:}

Todo se cambio esa noche

{voltio:}

Noche de calentura y de aventura y derroche

{Band:}

Hasta el color de las estrellas

{voltio:}

Cualquiera se envuelve con una chica tan bella

{Band:}

Todo se cambio esa noche

{voltio:}

Y yo la monto en mi coche hasta que se rompa el cloche

{Band:}

Hasta el color de las estrellas

{voltio:}

Una queria no hace mella le meto hondo y el hueco se sella

Todo se cambio esa noche

Metele N'klabe pa que la mami lo goze

Hasta el color de las estrellas

Todo fue tan diferente por ella

Por que te fuiste

No encuentro tu silueta

El valor de ser honestos

Porque me dejas

Mozo porqu√© me dejas
No dices como, ni cuando
Solo me dejas

Cuando andando por tu barrio
Yo me encuentro a tus amigos
Me dicen que te ven muy triste
Triste por haberte ido

Y eso es lo que yo no entiendo

Pero, ¬øv√≥s est√°s desde las 7 y media de la ma√±ana ac√°?
Loco, lo √∫nico que pido es un poco de poco all√°, loco
¬°Es lo √∫nico! Si a mi casa no vas m√°s
Olvidate, ¬øokay? Olvidate de todos esos asuntos
Y toda esa parafarnalia que vivimos juntos
Y todo el menguele que te doy desde mi coraz√≥n

Y olvidate de Tito
Y de los caminos al r√≠o, oh

O tempo passa mas a evolu√ß√£o √© lenta
Mas n√£o tenho pressa
Velocidade √© essa
N√£o h√° nada nesse mundo
Compadre que me estressa
Por√©m Ah Por√©m
H√° um caso diferente
Que envolve toda a minha gente
N√£o se embucha de ningu√©m
Fica do lado do bem
Atitude, amor e respeito tamb√©m
Eu vou no samba √© gente bamba
A diferen√ßa √© clara
A gente fuma e eles fama
Proteja a raiz pra que tenha bons frutos
J√° diz o velho ditado
Eu vou no samba
Eu vou no samba

Un poquito de afuera
Para poder armonizar

Su paso de caribe√±a

Cada vez que entraba la pena
Me volv√≠an a pisar
Unas hormiguitas negras
Que me hac√≠an carcagear
Y ya casi riendo de todo
Lo volv√≠ a ver pasar
Era el miedo con nuevo apodo
Que quer√≠a desordenar

14038,Dear Friend,Sugar Blizz,"[Verse 1]
My dear friend
Where have you been?
Where have you gone?
What did you win?
Someone there?
Are you listening?
Is it too late?
My dear friend

[Pre-Chorus]
We felt the sunshine
We found the gold
We thought we'd be forever young but now I know
We can't keep floating
We have to fold
This is the beat of broken hearts
Is it all lost?

[Chorus]
We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edg–µ
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast

[Verse 2]
My dear friend
You know I'd give in
Been waiting so long
To feel it
All of th–µse years
I‚Äôve been listening
Are you also numb?
Do you still pretend?

[Pre-Chorus]
We felt the sunshine
We found the gold
We thought we'd be forever young but now I know
We can't keep floating
We have to fold
This is the beat of broken hearts
Is it all lost?

[Chorus]
We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edge
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast

[Bridge]
Caught up in the flashing lights
Keep sedating my mind
Leading me on, like it's whatever
We could go on but we should know better

[Chorus]
We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edge
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast

We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edge
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast

14013,Mambeado,Onda Vaga,"Letra de ""Mambeado""Que lindo que es estar en la tierra
Despu√©s de haber vivido el infierno
Que lindo que es poder amarte y mirarte otra vez
Despu√©s de estar tan enfermo
Que lindo coraz√≥n que estas ac√° y ac√° latiendo
Y me desenredes los ojos
Y si por ah√≠ el miedo me viene a buscar de nuevo
Voy a recordar lo cantamos una vez
Mirando el cielo yo

Cantale a la luna y al sol
Cantale a la estrella que te acompa√±√≥
Cantale a tus amigos con el coraz√≥n
Cantale a la luna y al sol
Canta que es la tierra que canta en vos
Cantale a tus amigos con el coraz√≥n

Yo no s√© por qu√© a veces me pierdo
Los ojos se me dan vuelta y me muero por dentro
Y me encierro otra vez y no puedo salir
No puedo ver lo lindo de cada momento
Es que a veces no me le animo al ni√±o que llevo dentro
A veces pienso que est√°n mal algunas cosas que siento
Pero basta ya de eso y echa pa' fuera el baibaibon
No tengo tiempo ahora de eso
Estoy en otra canci√≥n, se acab√≥

Cantale a la luna y al sol
Cantale a la estrella que te acompa√±√≥
Cantale a tus amigos con el coraz√≥n
Cantale a la luna y al sol
Canta que es la tierra que canta en vos
Cantale a tus amigos con el coraz√≥n

Que lindo coraz√≥n que estas ac√° y ac√° latiendo
Y me desenredes los ojos
Y si por ah√≠ el miedo me viene a buscar de nuevo
Voy a recordar lo cantamos una vez

I got your letter
Guess this is better
You win sometimes
Lose sometimes
No need to apologise
It was the distance
We have between us
It broke us down in disguise
No need to apologise

Can't say I like it

I try to let go

Some things you‚Äôre certain are surely kismet
If the tides turn and they pull us apart
It wasn't in the stars

[Verse 2]
What do I care who's wrong or who‚Äôs right?
As long as it's you who's holding me tight
Why waste our time even if we just met?
Why play hard to get?

[Chorus]
I'll play the fool
When love is cruel
Maybe I'll learn the next time
Why play it cool?
Love knows no rules
As long as it's you that I call mine

[Verse 3]
I ask myself when I'm in a bind
When will you see that love can be blind?
How do you hold yourself up when you fall?
You win or you lose it all

[Chorus]
I'll play the fool
When love is cruel
Maybe I‚Äôll learn the next time
Why play it cool?
Love knows no rules
As long as it‚Äôs you that I call mine
I'll play the fool
When love is cruel
Maybe I‚Äôll learn the next time
Why play it cool?
Love knows no rules

Comienzo a sentir la ebriedad de la realidad
Las cosas que me sorprend√≠an
Hoy en d√≠a, ninguna me deslumbra de verdad
Los fantasmas que intento atrapar
Se me escabullen en los brazos
Tendr√≠a que aceptar mi realidad
O pedirle a los astros que tengan piedad
Aqu√≠ estoy trabajando y no pierdo la dignidad
Con este hambre voraz, queriendo siempre m√°s y m\as
Creyendo que alg√∫n d√≠a iba a poder saciar
Fantasiando que en alg√∫n momento de la vida
Me crecer√≠an alas pa' poder volar

Hay que estar atento, pa' no pasarse de ingenuidades

I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

Ich hab's geahnt!
Mein Horoskop hat diese Woche doch vor Flugreisen gewarnt
Die Fl√ºgel brennen
Die Menschen schreien
Ein paar Sekunden noch, dann wird h√∂chstens die Blackbox √ºbrig sein

Das Chaos tobt
Im dichten rauch
Die Optimisten blasen schon mal ihre Rettungswesten auf
Ich sitz verkrampft
Und kreidebleich
An meinem Kopf fliegt scheinbar schlecht verstautes Handgep√§ck vorbei

Es wird stets gesagt, bevor's zu Ende geht
Sieht man sein Leben wie im Zeitraffer nochmal
Ich w√ºrde zwar viel lieber etwas Anderes sehen
Doch da hat man ja vermutlich keine Wahl

Ich frag mich, was wohl meine letzten Worte waren
Den genauen Wortlaut kann ich nur erahnen
Doch mit Sicherheit - wie sollt es anders sein
War Tomatensaft dabei

Why you gotta be so wonderful?

And now I'm trying to get you off my mind
So why you gotta be so beautiful?
Why you gotta be so beautiful?

Don't say ""No"", I'll make a scene
'Cause in my head we're meant to be
It's not a joke, just how I feel

I would take that leap but I'm scared of heights
I'm in too deep to back out
So I hold my breath and I close my eyes
The time is never right, oh why

Verse 1:

I seen you walking by yourself just the other day, didn't approach you cause I couldn't think of words to say

Let me be the person that put a smile on your face, and if anybody try you Im breaking they face

Hold your hand while Im walking with you on the streets, a'int gotta play no games with me this can be for keeps

Can have a kid that one day me and you we can teach, have a lot of dinner dates pick a place to eat

You should wear some heels, you should show you're thighs, we can be together till the end of our lives

Might have some bad days, but mostly good days, she vibe to my music, yeah, she could stay

Bringing flowers to your job, to make you happy isn't hard, got you now I'm thanking God, know you'll never play the guy

Don't let one of these dudes throw a ring on you then you're trapped, its not about the gift itself but really how the gift is wrapped

Verse 2 :

I'll fall back if you feel bugged but this it could be real love, a year from now we'll still hug, not nervous if I mean mug

Wait on you while you get you're nails done, I a'int got a problem, one day ima get you Gucci, one day ima get you Prada

Hold it down while Im on the road chasing cash, ill never let you go cause you know this gone last

You can have my back, while Im writing in the lab, can be smiling when you see me getting closer than you laugh

After that, we relax, cause in time you get attacked, who would have thought we'd be a match, no funny ways you gone act

Don't like no there dudes be cause she knowing that they wack, you don't want to waste you're time but mostly give them the ass

But when you give it to me you knowing that Im gone grab, when you ask me am I ready I say ""You don't know the half""

Giving you summer love after that you gone be glad, replaying it in your mind of loving that you just had

If she by her lonesome, ask her if she want some, Come get some of this ""Summer Love""

Nothing's gonna come between us
Nothing's gonna come between us

Yeah, we are, we are the wild ones
We are, we are the wild ones

From my wrinkly pillow

A tale, a spell, a lie you never tell

I'm longing for you

Once upon a time, the Devil told me, I love you
And we lived sadly ever after
Once upon a time, the Devil had your eyes
And we lived sadly ever after

A grin, a sin, a crowning for the queen
A love is not forever, please don't cry or a make a scene
Can you feel the end tonight?
I want to sing goodbye to you while you sleep so tight

Pain as long as time
I'll make you mine
I'm longing for you
Pain as long as time
I'll make you mine
I'm longing for you

Once upon a time, the Devil told me, I love you
And we lived sadly ever after
Once upon a time, the Devil had your eyes

Let's sing a song
One happy song
Let's sing together
Let's sing a song
One happy song note, so happy, the end

14101,Discovery,Syn Cole,"[Verse 1]
Some days I felt lonely
Even though you were there
Sometimes I wonder if only
We were acting out our fear
Felt kinda like shadows
That faded away with the sun
Dreaming of the colors
And the days when we were young

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about it
Why don't you let me back in?
I've been thinking about it
But you keep slipping away

[Verse 2]
I've been thinking about it
How we got lost on the way
I really wanted to fight it
But I don't know how to stay
I don't know how to say this
But somehow we've been falling apart
I've been thinking about it lately
How we got lost on the way

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about it
Why don't you let me back in?
I've been thinking about it
But you keep slipping away
"
14124,Not a Goodbye,Alex Parker,"Kiss me back before you go
And let me taste the memories oh oh oh
You were my innocent mistake

I'd walk through fire all over with you again

Oh oh oh till we say our next hello baby
Oh oh oh I'm not good at letting go

Baby this is not a goodbye
Oh why?
I know we will meet again soon
Baby this is not a goodbye
Know why?
Because i'm not over you

Baby this is not a goodbye
Oh why?
I know we will meet again soon
Baby this is not a goodbye
Know why?
Because i'm not over you

Everything seems out of place
And im afraid you're now in love with someone else
My feelings won't change in time
Your absence haunts me like a ghost i keep alive

Oh oh oh till we say our next hello baby
Oh oh oh I'm not good at letting go

Baby this is not a goodbye
Oh why?
I know we will meet again soon
Baby this is not a goodbye
Know why?
Because i'm not over you
Baby this is not a goodbye
Oh why?
I know we will meet again soon
Baby this is not a goodbye
Know why?
Because i'm not over you

Y te vi llegar, no pude evitar preguntarte
Pude notar en tus ojos tristes que lloraste, lloraste, lloraste
¬øTe maltrat√≥, dime qu√© te hizo ese cobarde?
Su mam√° no le ense√±√≥ que eso a una mujer no se le hace
No se hace, no se hace (No, no, no, no, no)

D√©jame quitarte el maquillaje

El que tenga tienda que la atienda
O que salga de ella y que la venda
Si un hombre te la pega eso es un macho (Wuh)

Es que hace tiempo nadie me pone caliente (Uy)
Que me mate con flores y no con golpes

14112,Like a Hurricane,Basixx,"[Verse 1]
You're a rebel
Getting into trouble
You‚Äôre kinda like a fire, like a fire, like a fire
Unpredictable
So original
You're never backing down, backing down, backing down

[Pre-Chorus]
That's what I like about you
So dangerous
I get this rush
When I‚Äôm with you
I go all in
To lose or win

Building stuff to knock them down
It's the way we keep our high
Moving like a hurricane
There will come a time for when
We can wash away our sins
Settle down but until then
We're like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
You're so different
Kind of ignorant
You don't care what people say, people say, people say
I'm going crazy
For you baby
Don't know how you're making me, feel this way, what can I say

[Pre-Chorus]
That‚Äôs what I like about you
So dangerous

14139,Cristina,Maffio,"Eu fui ver a minha amada
L√° pr√≥s baixos dum jardim
Dei-lhe uma rosa encarnada
Para se lembrar de mim

Eu fui ver o meu benzinho
L√° pr√≥s lados dum passal
Dei-lhe o meu len√ßo de linho
Que √© do mais fino bragal

Eu fui ver uma donzela
Numa barquinha a dormir
Dei-lhe uma colcha de seda
Para nela se cobrir

Eu fui ver uma solteira
Numa salinha a fiar
Dei-lhe uma rosa vermelha
Para de mim se encantar

Eu fui ver a minha amada
L√° nos campos eu fui ver
Dei-lhe uma rosa encarnada
Para de mim se prender

Verdes prados, verdes campos
Onde est√° minha paix√£o
As andorinhas n√£o param
Umas voltam outras n√£o

Minha m√£e quando eu morrer
Ai chore por quem muito amargou
Para ent√£o dizer ao mundo
Ai Deus mo deu Ai Deus mo levou

I know you're coming back for everything that we had
You're so unpredictable with the way that you act
I'll show you all the reasons why we didn't last
And now it's time to fake the blame

Our story ends with me feeling so alone
There's no way you coming back, please just let me go
And I picked you up but you push me to my knees
Now I'm strugglin' to breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Your missed call is another sign to me
That you never had to leave
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can see all the days we didn't meet
You won't own me so I let you go
Oh no, oh no

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Your heart's jinxed, played the melodies to keep my head
They hold me like the shadows underneath my bed
You got me lost inside your everchanging maze
Now it's too late to escape

I can't be wasting time, playing silly games
Control it with your lies that i dont wanna say
And I got back up, now I'm stood on my two feet
So it's time for you to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Your missed call is another sign to me
That you never had to leave
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can see all the days we didn't meet
You won't own me so I let you go
Oh no, oh no

Your missed call is another sign to me
That you never had to leave
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can see all the days we didn't meet
You won't own me so I let you go
Oh no, oh no

Nothing stayed the same

Tell me if I‚Äôm dreaming
Are we the lucky ones?
Are we the lucky ones?

Went from quitter to winner
No, I never gon' leave her
Love the fact that I've been so wrong
Now I know she's a keeper

Bend the wood and build the ships
Say farewell with a widow's kiss

Where the unknown is all we know
Lay with me, darling
Let's sleep beneath another sky

When the cold keeps us from sleep?

Lo que tiene esa mujer
Que no se aferra a nada

Te hace tragar esas palabras

Ni que traten de conquistarla
Mucho menos que le lleven flores
Que por ahora no se casa..

14113,Fireproof,offrami,"[Verse 1]
Straight up, I think you‚Äôre scared to love
I said it
Oh, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre backing out
Last night I know was dangerous
I get it
Because both of our guards were down

[Pre-Chorus]
If we were like two kids
Caught with a lighter, after starting a fire
But baby, why all this?
There‚Äôs no point in fighting
There‚Äôs no point in fighting when

[Chorus]
I know you feel for me what I feel for you
I know you felt the heat when I was holding you
But how we supposed to burn, like them lovers do
If you keep, you keep, you keep acting all fireproof

[Verse 2]
No lie, this is the realest thing
I mean it
Maybe that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre lying up
Wishing right now you were here with me
Under blankets
'Cause I‚Äôm the only one who lights you up

[Pre-Chorus]
We could be like two kids
Catching on fire, using lips as our lighters
So baby, why all this?
There‚Äôs no point in fighting
There‚Äôs no point in fighting when

[Chorus]
I know you feel for me what I feel for you
I know you felt the heat when I was holding you
But how we supposed to burn, like them lovers do
If you keep, you keep, you keep acting all fireproof

I know you feel for me what I feel for you
But how we supposed to burn, like them lovers do
If you keep, you keep, you keep acting all fireproof

Aunque estaba buscando
Yo sigo guard√°ndote a ti el lugar
Y por m√°s que lo intente
Yo s√© que ninguna te va a cambiar (Mmh)
Yo ya casi no duermo
Por andar mirando mi celular
Por si acaso a ti se te olvidaba
Que no me quer√≠as llamar

Porque bailas como nadie m√°s sabe bailar
Te pareces a la playa y las olas del mar

[Verso 2: Mau y Ricky & Camilo]
Si yo no te tengo me muero (No, no)
T√∫ no est√°s y me matan los celos
Se me va el aire si t√∫ te vas (No te vayas)
Porque la vida se me va yendo
Baby, s√≠, yo te quiero para m√≠ (Para m√≠, para m√≠)
No te quiero compartir (Oh no no no)
Como hielo en el desierto (Como hielo en el desierto)
Yo me derrito por ti (¬°Pra!)
Porque cuando t√∫ est√°s lejos (Cuando t√∫ no est√°s)
Siento que me pongo viejo (Ey)
Que no se me pase el tiempo

I'm not over all the messed up shit you said
I forgive you, but it's not easy to forget
Eventually I'll find a place to lock these hard feelings away
Eventually, but not right now

I was gonna let it slide
Till you went and fooled me twice

I view you like I used to

One day, I'll look at you through
Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes

When I'm colder and you don't trigger my short fuse
Eventually I'll find a place in my heart to give you grace

Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes

Yo lo √∫nico que pido es que siempre duermas conmigo
Y que en los momentos de fr√≠o, seas mi mejor abrigo
Yo nunca me quitar√© aunque me celes y me pelees
Y aunque te hablen mal de mi yo te pido que no me dejes, si yo
Soy jardinero y te cuido como una flor
No soy perfecto y contigo soy el mejor
No me dejes solo sin tus besos por favor

Si me dieran a escoger
No sabr√≠a qu√© decir
Pero ojal√° que seas tu
Ay, solamente tu
La que siempre est√° ah√≠ cuando m√°s necesito
La que me regala momentos bonitos
Me esta robando toda la confianza, poquito a poquito

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Me quedar√© contigo
Voy a robarle todas las flechas a cupido
Y te dar√© mi coraz√≥n con un motivo
Que solo por tu amor

O dia em que voc√™ me pediu em casamento
Depois fugiu‚ÄÖe‚ÄÖnunca voltou
Quantas vezes‚ÄÖme silenciou
Os amigos me avisavam que‚ÄÖvoc√™ n√£o presta
Mas prum apaixonado s√≥ o que interessa
√â viver esse amor
Foi falso enquanto durou

E agora vai provar do pr√≥prio veneno

Agora chora, chora
Seu feiti√ßo virou contra e quebrou sua cara

Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

Fiquei sabendo que anda pelos cantos
Sofrendo e lamentando porque perdeu tanto
As vantagens que aproveitou
A amizade que renegou
E agora ainda quer que eu me compade√ßa
Depois que fodeu toda a inoc√™ncia
Encontrei meu auto-amor
Seu controle agora acabou

Quantas vezes me silenciou
E ainda veio achando que ia sair por cima
Comigo n√£o
As contas que deixou pra tr√°s
Vou mandar pra casa dos seus pais
E essa foi a √∫ltima vez que me levantou a m√£o
Comigo n√£o (Comigo n√£o, comigo n√£o)

[Refr√£o]
Chora, chora
Filha da puta, agora chora, chora
Seu feiti√ßo virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

Teu encaracolado
Me encaracolou
Me envolveu no la√ßo
Sinto que √© amor
Me encaixo no seu
Se enrola no meu
Amor tamb√©m
Teu encaracolado
Me encaracolou
Me envolveu no la√ßo
Sinto que √© amor
Me encaixo no seu
Se enrola no meu amor

[Verso 1]
Impressionado, fascinado
Com o teu lado t√£o descolado
√Äs vezes muito pouco arrumado
Teu black, teu cacho, teu crespo, teu afro
Ondula, ondulado, enrolado
E em seus cachos ser√° que me encaixo?
Em seu peito tem pra mim um espa√ßo
Se enrosca no meu que eu me enrosco no teu
Se amarra no meu que me amarro no teu

[Refr√£o]
Encaracolado
Me encaracolou
Me envolveu no la√ßo

Me envolveu no la√ßo
Sinto que √© amor
Me encaixo no seu
Se enrola no meu
Amor tamb√©m

N√£o importa a hora e nem o lugar
Mesmo sem te ver sinto voc√™ chegar
√â uma loucura esse amor me dominar
Eu sou a noite e voc√™ a luz do luar

Se amarra no meu, me amarro no teu
Se enrosca no meu, me enrosco no teu, amor
Se enrola no meu pois eu quero ser teu
Se encaixa no meu que eu me encaixo no teu

Teu encaracolado
Me encaracolou

Me encaracolou
Me envolveu no la√ßo
Sinto que √© amor
Me encaixo no seu
Se enrola no meu amor

Parei de reclamar, a vida vai passar, n√£o vou ficar mais nessa
Olha pro lado e v√™ quem anda com voc√™, c√™ tem que abra√ßar

E a√≠, Silva?
Eu j√° ca√≠ no ch√£o e quem me deu a m√£o foi uma gente boa

Palavras v√£o voltar e podem se vingar da sua ingratid√£o

Tamb√©m jovem nesse jogo, mas j√° t√£o bem amante

Agora vai ter festa na floresta

Standing on the frontline of mi Puerto Plata
They met Wednesday night in the middle of Cofres√≠
And then he fell in love with his caribbean mulata

He came to the rescue right when the Memphis met the sea
The tidal wave just broke the heart of mi arahuaca
So they sent him back where he was meant to be

Arrollante sigo el destino que me ha hecho triunfante

Oye muy bonita yo doy vueltecita solo quiero echar una bailadita
Una quebradita con tu hermanita que es tan bonita

14161,Tu Amor Es Como Un R√≠o,Kany Garcia,"[Letra de ""Tu amor es como un r√≠o""]

[Verso 1]
Tengo una mirada desconocida
Ahora que apareces, la encuentro
Estaba muy adentro escondida

[Verso 2]
Dame una sonrisa y me desarmas
Si siento que me estoy perdiendo
Es solo que me temo que al fin encuentro

[Pre-Coro]
Ll√©vame, t√∫ ll√©vame, y ll√©vame volando en un beso
Ll√©vame, si est√°s t√∫

[Coro]
Tu amor es como un r√≠o
Que en cada beso vuelve y me ba√±a
Es como una corriente que arrastra
Con solo verte ah√≠ en la puerta de casa
Tu amor es como un r√≠o
Que da tanto que se me desborda
Y a veces aunque nade en su contra
Desisto y tan solo me dejo as√≠ llevar

[Verso 3]
Tienes mil excusas para olvidarme
Y si siento que te estoy perdiendo
Te doy cien mil razones para quedarte

[Pre-Coro]
Ay, ll√©vame, t√∫ ll√©vame, y ll√©vame volando en un beso
Ll√©vame, si est√°s t√∫

[Coro]
Tu amor es como un r√≠o
Que en cada beso vuelve y me ba√±a
Que es como una corriente que arrastra
Con solo verte ah√≠ en la puerta de casa
Tu amor es como un r√≠o
Que da tanto que se me desborda
Y a veces aunque nade en su contra
Desisto y tan solo me dejo as√≠ llevar

[Puente] [x2]
(Pr√©stame tu cuello) Para hacerle un nido
(Gu√°rdame tu beso) Ay, pal regreso a casa
(D√©jame tu sombra) Como un farolito
(Qu√©date hasta ver) Salir las hojas blancas

[Coro]
Tu amor es como un r√≠o
Que en cada beso vuelve y me ba√±a
Es como una corriente que arrastra
Con solo verte ah√≠ en la puerta de casa
Tu amor es como un r√≠o
Que da tanto que se me desborda
Y a veces aunque nade en su contra
Desisto y tan solo me dejo as√≠ llevar

Y ahora e' que la cosa se va a poner buena aqu√≠
Gozadera total, pa' lante
Hagan bulla, aqu√≠ el party
Move your body, everybody
La gente m√≠a, latino' el mundo
En alegr√≠a vamo' juntos
A la monta√±a de mi patria
Dominicana, el acorde√≥n
Tocando fuerte, bien de cierto
Y quiero verte, chocando cuerpo
Mojando la ropa, as√≠ se goza
Moviendo la cosa maravillosa
Con mucho swing 'del latin'
Calientita como el aj√≠ (?)
Quisqueyana que buena baila usted
Da la vuelta mami otra vez
Lleg√≥ el negro de la joya
Fulano de tal, gozadera total

Swing, Swing swing... (de fondo)
Vamo' a gozar, vamo' a bailar la fiesta esta buena, yo me vo' a quedar

Sigue sigue (reach out) goza goza, gozadera total

Merengueao ripeao pa' su hijo

Corriente, con mucha corriente
Desorden forma de repente

Barcel√≥ es lo que bebe la gente
Bailando el weekend gozando
Totalmente, sigan acabando

Ahora, a parrandear. Ahora vamo' a gozar
Con el mene√≠to moviendo el ombliguito
Las mujeres hembras que tiemblan
Oye mami no te lo pierdas
Es el mene√≠to moviendo el ombliguito
Con ganas

Francamente yo soy teniente
No puedes verme con par de lentes
Chequea el estilo pegando siempre
Como un martillo saben, aprende de este chin como se hace con mucho swing
Sin pararse la noche entera, sin barreras a tu manera
Haz lo que quieras c√°ntele un coro
Con tu cuerpo mami, tienes tu el derecho, mira que hay bastante nena
No tenga' pena pecho a pecho, lao a lao magia latina, lao a lao
Cepilla cepilla guallalo bien, dejalo en brillo
Gozadera total e' lo que brindo

Gozadera total!!

Con bulla, hagan una bulla, hagan una bulla por ahi pas√≥, por ahi pas√≥
Mira donde va, mira donde va, v√°mono' con el , v√°mono' con el
Arranca, arranca....., bien la arranc√≥

14157,Salsa Pa' Olvidar las Penas,V√≠ctor Manuelle,"Letra de ""Salsa Pa' Olvidar las Penas"" ft. Gilberto Santa Rosa[Coro: Cheo Qui√±onez & Pichie Perez, Victor Manuelle]
Pa' el que se sienta triste
Yo traigo la receta
Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas
Pa' el que se sienta triste
Yo traigo la receta
Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas
(¬°Eeeh!)

[Verso 1: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa]
Apaga las noticias, sal pa' la calle y que te d√© el sol
Cambia las corta venas, sube la radio en esta canci√≥n
No pierdas la esperanza cuando el conteo est√© en tres y dos
Hazle swing pa' botarla aunque no siempre salga un homerun

[Puente: Gilberto Santa Rosa, Victor Manuelle, Juntos, (Cheo Qui√±onez & Pichie Perez)]
(Buscale la salida a ese rompecabezas)
Y en esta vida, cada problema, bailando salsa se arregla

[Coro: Cheo Qui√±onez & Pichie Perez, Victor Manuelle]
Pa' el que se sienta triste
Yo traigo la receta
Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas
(T√∫ no te quedes afuera)
Pa' el que se sienta triste
Yo traigo la receta
Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas
(D√≠selo Gilberto)

[Verso 2: Gilberto Santa Rosa, Victor Manuelle]
Yo me curo con rumbas si tengo alguna preocupaci√≥n, (es la cosa)
Tres golpes de campana, dos cucharadas de guaguanc√≥
Por eso hay que vencer el miedo cuando se aprieta la situaci√≥n
La bola est√° en tu cancha para que sigas tu coraz√≥n

[Puente: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Juntos, (Cheo Qui√±onez & Pichie Perez)]
(Buscale la salida a ese rompecabezas)
Y en esta vida, cada problema, bailando salsa se arregla

[Verso 3: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa, (Cheo Qui√±onez & Pichie Perez)]
Yo traigo la medicina que te alivia los problemas
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
No hay mal que dure cien a√±os
Ni cuerpo que lo resista cuando la m√∫sica suena
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
Recuerda que las penas se van cantando
Olvida tu dolor y vive celebrando
Ay, que lo bueno te llega
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
S√≠, la receta t√∫ la sabes
Los discos de Rub√©n Blades, de Rosario, La Ponce√±a
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
Salsa, salsa yo te traigo
La misma que estoy cantando
La que corre por mis venas
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
Johnny me gusta, me gusta
T√∫ sabes que me gusta, me gusta la rom√°ntica
Me gusta la cl√°sica y la nueva
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
¬°Eeeh!
¬°Caminen otra vez!

[Skit: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa, (Cheo Qui√±onez & Pichie Perez)]
Oye, a todo el mundo
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
Por eso es que Tito y Tamara siempre est√°n contentos
Claro Gilberto, si el que baila salsa no sufre
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
¬°Eso!
¬°Canta!, ¬°canta!, ¬°canta!
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)

[Verso 4: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa]
Venimos de Tito Puentes, Celia Cruz, H√©ctor Lavoe
Tito Rodr√≠guez, Panchito, donde todo comenz√≥
Ya su labor est√° hecha, con talento y emoci√≥n
Ya s√≠ le abrieron la brecha a la nueva generaci√≥n
El Gran Combo, La Ponce√±a, y tambi√©n La Matancera
La Fania, Cheo Feliciano, y el gran Ismael Rivera
A todos los saludamos, a todos los recordamos
Tambi√©n los homenajeamos, ¬°V√≠ctor!, con la salsa que tocamos

[Outro: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa, (Cheo Qui√±onez & Pichie Perez)]
Gilberto, y a todos los salseros que se nos quedaron
Muchas gracias por su aportaci√≥n
¬°Eeeh!

(Yo te traigo mi salsa)
La que yo llevo en el alma
(Para olvidar las penas)
Oye, oye, t√∫ no te quedes afuera
(Yo te traigo mi salsa)
La que se baila y se canta
(Para olvidar las penas)
La que cambia los problemas por la gozadera
(¬°Salsa!)
Mu√©vete al ritmo de un son
(¬°Salsa!)
De una rumba o una plena
(¬°Salsa!)
Deja afuera ese dolor, aquello que te condena
(¬°Salsa!)
Y yo s√© que la cosa est√° dura
(¬°Salsa!)
La [?], la calle est√° tensa
(¬°Salsa!)
No te pongas en depresi√≥n
(¬°Pa' olvidar las penas!)
Vete a bailar en la acera

¬°Eeeh!
¬°Eeeh!
¬°Eeeh!, ¬°Salsa!

14177,AmarElo,Emicida,"[Letra de ""AmarElo"" com Emicida, Majur & Pabllo Vittar]

[Intro: Belchior]
Presentemente eu posso me considerar um sujeito de sorte
Porque apesar de muito mo√ßo, me sinto s√£o e salvo e forte
E tenho comigo pensado: Deus √© brasileiro e anda do meu lado
E assim j√° n√£o posso sofrer no ano passado

[Refr√£o: Belchior]
Tenho sangrado demais, tenho chorado pra cachorro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro
Tenho sangrado demais, tenho chorado pra cachorro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro

[Verso 1: Emicida]
Eu sonho mais alto que drones
Combust√≠vel do meu tipo? A fome
Pra arrega√ßar como um ciclone (Entendeu?)
Pra que amanh√£ n√£o seja s√≥ um ontem com um novo nome
O abutre ronda, ansioso pela queda (Sem sorte)
Findo m√°goa, mano, sou mais que essa merda (Bem mais)
Corpo, mente, alma, um tipo Ayurveda
Estilo √°gua, eu corro no meio das pedra
Na trama, tudo os drama turvo, eu sou um dramaturgo
Conclama a se afastar da lama, enquanto inflama o mundo
Sem melodrama, busco grana, isso √© hosana em curso
Capulanas, catanas, buscar nirvana √© o recurso
√â um mundo c√£o pra n√≥iz, perder n√£o √© op√ß√£o, certo?
De onde o vento faz a curva, brota o papo reto
Num deixo quieto, n√£o tem como deixar quieto
A meta √© deixar sem ch√£o, quem riu de n√≥s sem teto (Vai)

[Refr√£o: Majur, Emicida & Belchior]
Tenho sangrado demais (Aham)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (Eu preciso cuidar de mim)
Ano passado eu morri (Ei)
Mas esse ano eu n√£o morro (Esse ano eu n√£o morro)
Tenho sangrado demais (Demais)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (Aham)
Ano passado eu morri
Mas esse ano eu n√£o morro (Belchior tinha raz√£o)
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro (Ei, yeah)

[Verso 2: Emicida]
Figurinha premiada, brilho no escuro
Desde a quebrada avulso
De gorro, alto do morro e os camarada tudo
De pe√ßa no forro e os piores impulsos
S√≥ eu e Deus sabe o que √© num ter nada, ser expulso
Ponho linhas no mundo, mas j√° quis p√¥r no pulso
Sem o torro, nossa vida n√£o vale a de um cachorro, triste
""Hoje Cedo"" n√£o era um hit, era um pedido de socorro
Mano, rancor √© igual um tumor, envenena a raiz
Onde a plateia s√≥ deseja ser feliz (Ser feliz)
Com uma presen√ßa a√©rea
Onde a √∫ltima tend√™ncia √© depress√£o com apar√™ncia de f√©rias
Vov√≥ diz: Odiar o diabo √© m√≥ boi (M√≥ boi)
Dif√≠cil √© viver no inferno, e vem √† tona
Que o memo imp√©rio canalha que n√£o te leva a s√©rio
Interfere pra te levar √† lona (Revide)

[Refr√£o: Majur, Emicida, Majur & Pabllo Vittar & Belchior]
Tenho sangrado demais (Aham)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (Aham, yeah, yeah)
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro (Ah, ah, ah)
Tenho sangrado demais (Demais)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (T√£o precisando de mim)
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro

[Ponte: Pabllo Vittar, Emicida & Majur]
Permita que eu fale, n√£o as minhas cicatrizes
Elas s√£o coadjuvantes
N√£o, melhor, figurantes que nem devia t√° aqui
Permita que eu fale, n√£o as minhas cicatrizes
Tanta dor rouba nossa voz, sabe o que resta de n√≥s?
Alvos passeando por a√≠
Permita que eu fale, n√£o as minhas cicatrizes
Se isso √© sobre viv√™ncia, me resumir √† sobreviv√™ncia
√â roubar o pouco de bom que eu vivi
Por fim, permita que eu fale, n√£o as minhas cicatrizes
Achar que essas mazelas me definem √© o pior dos crimes
√â dar o trof√©u pro nosso algoz e fazer n√≥iz sumir

[Refr√£o: Pabllo Vittar, Emicida & Majur & Pabllo Vittar]
Tenho sangrado demais (Falei)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (√â o meu sol que invade a cela)
Ano passado eu morri (Ei)
Mas esse ano eu n√£o morro
Tenho sangrado demais (Demais)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (Mais importante que nunca)
Ano passado eu morri (Mas a√≠?)
Mas esse ano eu n√£o morro
Tenho sangrado demais, tenho chorado pra cachorro
(Tenho chorado demais, a rua √© n√≥iz)
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro
Tenho sangrado demais, tenho chorado pra cachorro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro

[Sa√≠da: Emicida, Pabllo Vittar & Majur]
(Laborat√≥rio Fantasma)
A√≠, maloqueiro! A√≠, maloqueira!
Levanta essa cabe√ßa (Vem)
Enxuga essas l√°grimas, certo? (√â voc√™ memo)
Respira fundo e volta a correr (Vai)
'C√™ vai sair dessa pris√£o (Aham)
'C√™ vai atr√°s desse diploma com a f√∫ria da beleza do sol, entendeu? (√â isso)
Faz isso por n√≥s, faz essa por n√≥s (Vai)
Te vejo no p√≥dio
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu n√£o morro

Baby, eu j√° cansei de me esconder

Entre conversas soltas pelo ch√£o
Teu corpo teso, duro, s√£o
E o teu cheiro que ainda ficou
Na minha m√£o

Um novo tempo h√° de vencer
Pra que a gente possa florescer
E, baby, amar, amar
Sem temer

[Refr√£o]
Apaga a luz e deixa o tempo passar
Baby, voc√™ n√£o perde por esperar
Apaga a luz, n√£o h√° nada a temer
Apaga a luz quando √© s√≥ eu e voc√™
Apaga a luz
Apaga a luz

[Verso 1]
E olha nos olhos de quem diz que te quer
Diz que eu sou sua mulher
Te disse ontem que eu t√¥ pronta pro que der e vier
Apaga essa luz agora (Ah-ah)
A chuva j√° cai l√° fora (Ah)
S√≥ cola o teu corpo no meu

Apaga a luz e deixa o tempo passar

Vou te deixar √† vontade
Larga tudo a√≠, vem me encontrar mais tarde
O cheiro da sua pele inebria, invade
√â chama que at√© sem oxig√™nio se arde
Eu quero te falar tudo que eu mais quero
Quero a vida do seu lado e come√ßar do zero
Se pudesse fazer mais, eu faria mais pra te ver bem mais que feliz, eu te juro sincero (oh yeah)
Ent√£o fica comigo, baby
Sabe, eu posso te amar pra sempre
Sei cada resposta pra cada pergunta que voc√™ faria um dia sobre pertencer
Olha s√≥ pro meu plano agora:
Te levo pra ver o mundo l√° fora
F√©rias de ver√£o em Bora-Bora
Ou at√© roubar um banco
Bora?

14231,Escolheu a Pessoa Errada para Humilhar,Johnny Hooker,"[Letra de ""Escolheu a Pessoa Errada para Humilhar"" com Johnny Hooker & Boss in Drama]

[Verso 1]
Lembra das chaves do nosso apartamento
O dia em que voc√™ me pediu em casamento
Depois fugiu‚ÄÖe‚ÄÖnunca voltou
Quantas vezes‚ÄÖme silenciou
Os amigos me avisavam que‚ÄÖvoc√™ n√£o presta
Mas prum apaixonado s√≥ o que interessa
√â viver esse amor
Foi falso enquanto durou

[Pr√©-Refr√£o]
E agora voc√™ vai se sentir t√£o pequeno
E agora vai provar do pr√≥prio veneno
Seu feiti√ßo agora acabou
Ficou claro quando um novo amor rolou

[Refr√£o]
Chora, chora
Agora chora, chora
Seu feiti√ßo virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

[Verso 2]
Fiquei sabendo que anda pelos cantos
Sofrendo e lamentando porque perdeu tanto
As vantagens que aproveitou
A amizade que renegou
E agora ainda quer que eu me compade√ßa
Depois que fodeu toda a inoc√™ncia
Encontrei meu auto-amor
Seu controle agora acabou

[Refr√£o]
Chora, chora
Filha da puta, agora chora, chora
Seu feiti√ßo virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

[Verso 3]
Os boletos que n√£o pagou
Quantas vezes me silenciou
E ainda veio achando que ia sair por cima
Comigo n√£o
As contas que deixou pra tr√°s
Vou mandar pra casa dos seus pais
E essa foi a √∫ltima vez que me levantou a m√£o
Comigo n√£o (Comigo n√£o, comigo n√£o)

[Refr√£o]
Chora, chora
Filha da puta, agora chora, chora
Seu feiti√ßo virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

E te queimei com meus raios em grande quantia

14237,New Dream,Roman M√ºller,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember back in high school?
Looking at us like fools
Were we crazy or misunderstood?
I‚ÄÖhad‚ÄÖdreams of being‚ÄÖsomeone
Traveling beyond the
Same city streets that‚ÄÖwe were used to

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm here on the other side of the world
A few more lines on my face, a little heartburn
But you know I'll keep dreaming of a new place
When I close my eyes, I'm seeing it

[Chorus]
I know, you're in my heart always
Where I go, this memory won't erase
Know, that the dreams are for the living
Even if they all come true, we start a new dream

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
As I see another sunrise
New light on an old life
We're the same and so much different now
Did you end up where you planned to?
Did love come to find you?
And was it like we used to talk about?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're here on the other side of the world
A few more lines on your face, a little heartburn
And I know we'll keep dreaming of a new place
When I close my eyes, I'm seeing it

I know, you're in my heart always
Where I go, this memory won't erase
Know, that the dreams are for the living
Even if they all come true, we start a new dream

Everything you told me was the truth?
Once again alone‚ÄÖat‚ÄÖmidnight
Once again I'm‚ÄÖdrinking over you
You treated me like‚ÄÖI was special
You made me believe every lie
You made me feel like I was precious
When you held me tight
But guess I am learning my lesson
This is my saying goodbye
'Cause I figured you, figured you, figured you out

Gonna love, love, love, love my life without you
'Cause I'm loving every moment that you're not around
No, I'm not gonna miss the mess you got me into
'Cause I figured you, figured you, figured you out
'Cause I figured you, figured you out
'Cause I figured you, figured you out

No more asking me for favors
Done picking you up, paying your bills
No more covering up your bad behavior
When you popped too many of your pills

Rituals happen in the house
If you gon' tell me what it is, just tell me now
The lights keep flickerin' 'round and 'round
I spent too much time lookin' down
Let's do a magic trick, turn that frown upside down
She said she heard evil things inside of my house
Fell asleep by the window, we can look out
Wake up to the evil sounds of the owls

I know you want more from me
But I can only give you what I have
Have, have, have, have
Have, have, have, have

Have, what the fuck do I have inside my bag?
I got pills in a bottle, wanna have one?
You can have one, maybe if you ask
Baby, you look so pretty, I wanna ask you
Do you wanna go on a date with me to the bathroom?
We can snort up these lines
We can do anything anytime if you want, I'ma have you
Baby, you look so good, you look like an angel
I'll be your sideman, I can be your devil
Devil on your shoulder, I'ma send you love letters
We can go to Hell or we can go to Heaven
We can go to Heaven, we can go to Heaven
You look so good make me hungry
I wanna eat you alive with some dumplings
I know you want what I have, you want something
Everything I have, it could be yours
But I can only give you what I have
If you don't want that, there's no more

With the warning signs
Flashing lights
Patience running low

You must say you hate me
At your parent's house
You walked out
I bet they're happy now
They know, I know

You, take over my mind
For you, I'll take us back to

The long drives, all night
On the backseat, come closer
I just wanna hold you
As we lay amongst the stars
We'll have a different kind of-
I love you, you love me
Say do you mean it?
Yeah, we're sweet
We'll have a different kind of us
A different kind of love
A different kind of love

Looking for a compromise, maybe
We can turn this round
It'll all work out
Go back to that love
That we both know

Nothing's back in this place for me anyway

Travel daytime into the night

See Stockholm, travel through Japan
Go to Sydney, Bombay, Singapore

Had to leave, I'm just trying to find my way
On the road, living life each day by day

Venture far to the morning light

Baby we‚Äôre a mess
So I'm just feeling so good
Nobody can do it like you
Give me that feeling give me that radio love

If I lit a thousand lights to ease your mind
Would it feel like home
If I really took the time to say you're right
And I‚Äôve got it wrong

Baby I'm so sick of fighting
You hypnotize me
I don't want to lose it
You can travel the world go to the moon
Still I'll follow

I want it I need it
A feeling you give me
So sing it throw me back
Give me that feeling give me that radio love

14264,So Sick,EC Twins,"[Verse 1]
Gotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we,‚ÄÖcan't‚ÄÖcome to the‚ÄÖphone
And I know it makes no‚ÄÖsense 'cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
It's ridiculous
It's been months and for some reason I just-
Can't get over us
And I'm stronger than this
Enough is enough
No more walking 'round with my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you

[Chorus]
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Why can't I turn off the radio?

[Drop]
Why can't I turn off the radio?

[Verse 2]
Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be

[Chorus]
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Why can't I turn off the radio?

[Drop]
Why can't I turn off the radio?

[Chorus]
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs (Ayy)
So tired of tears (I'm so tired of tears)
So done with wishing you were still here (Oh-oh)
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Why can't I turn off the radio?

14273,Netflix & Chill,The Twinz,"So you don't have a job
It's not about how much you're making
As long as you‚ÄÖlove‚ÄÖme every night,‚ÄÖI'm good
So you don't have a‚ÄÖcar
It don't look good on paper
As long as you always treat me right, I'm good

We can watch Netflix and chill
Walk around naked, we will
'Til your mama comes in, and throws you out once again
Let us just break down the house
Smoke a little out on the couch
'Til your mama comes in, and throws you out once again

Did I just caught an L
Don't know, it's hard to tell
Someway you're kind of overdue
It's true
You say you'll change your ways
But there's no time to waste
'Cause you are almost 32
It's true

We can watch Netflix and chill
Baby, that won't pay the bills
If you keep messing up
One day, life will catch up
Baby, let's break down the house
Until they kick us out
All this money you've spent, on everything but the rent

Yes, I'm a sucker for love
Can believe that it's true
Somehow you stole my heart
I don't know what to do
Been hiding you from my friends
It's time to meet 'em I guess
Yes, I'm a sucker for love
But hey, you're a sucker too
Yes, I'm a sucker for love
But hey, you're a sucker too

Da da da da da da dum
Da da da da da da dum
Da da da da da da dum
You're a sucker too

14250,Strongest,Ina Wroldsen,"[Verse 1]
You sit there with that look on your face like you won
Like nothing that I say is gonna change how you feel now
You sit there and you tell me you fell outta love
And we are in your way so you just gotta leave now
And we just need to understand your reasons
And you are gonna justify this treason
By telling me the promises that we sworn ain't enough

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you gonna be another person?
And how do I explain this shit to our son?
How'd you tell a toddler about a girlfriend?
Daddy's gone

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

[Verse 2]
You sit there with your phone in your hands and you're hurt
You tell me that you feel like you lost me when he came
I'm sorry but I cannot connect with your words
'Cause right now what matters isn't yours but it is his name
And we just need to find another income
'Cause she wants you to help her with her own one
And you want me to tell me that what you've done is okay

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you gonna be another father?
And I will be a different kind of mother?
And you'd tell a toddler 'bout step brothers?
Daddy's strayed

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

[Bridge]
Let's talk about family
Let's talk about family
Let's talk of the ties and the lies
And the love that we had in this family
Let's talk about honesty
You know nothing about honesty
I'll let go of your hands and our plans
And the chance that we had with this family

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone
Oh na na, we'll leave you alone

14253,Too Loud,RO√ãDS,"[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
I carry an anger, not so many have seen
It takes a‚ÄÖlot‚ÄÖof effort, not‚ÄÖletting it carry me
It would never‚ÄÖtouch you or harm you in any way
It's more like something taunting keeping me restrained
It's almost like a ghost, for those who believe they see
Like an inner voice, a broken ego of me
And I don't care to be more like someone else
Just as an equal, I want to have something said

[Chorus]
Careless I may seem but caring it's all I do
Not to please others but to keep myself true
I'm singing, I'm breathing, just to keep it out
Sometimes the voice I hear is just too loud

[Drop]
Just too loud, just too loud
Oh, just too loud, oh, just too loud
Oh, just too loud, oh, just too loud
Just too loud, it's just too loud

[Chorus]
Careless I may seem but caring it's all I do
Not to please others but to keep myself true
I'm singing, I'm breathing, just to keep it out
Sometimes the voice I hear is just too loud

[Verse 2]
I carry an anger, not so many have seen
It takes a lot of effort, not letting it carry me
I can't help the feeling, that I have to fight
From morning to evening and to catch up with life
It's almost like a song but the rhythm is offbeat
Like I am waking up from an old memory

[Chorus]
Careless I may seem but caring it's all I do
Not to please others but to keep myself true
I'm singing, I'm breathing, just to keep it out
Sometimes the voice I hear is just too loud

[Drop]
Just too loud, just too loud
Oh, just too loud, oh, just too loud

No laying down
I wanna mess up
Your Comfort Zone

I wanna mess up
Your Comfort Zone

[Verse 2]
Sorry, didn't wanna push too far
Thought you'd like your sushi rolls
But did I spot some smile?
Talk is cheap so skip the lines
Gi-girls just like it deep sometimes
Just dim down the lights

[Chorus]
There's no double talk
You ought to know
I wanna mess up
Your Comfort Zone
Put down your phone
No laying down
I wanna mess up
Your Comfort Zone

I wanna mess up
Your Comfort Zone

I wanna mess up
Your Comfort Zone
I wanna mess up
Your Comfort Zone
I wanna mess up
Your Comfort Zone

14255,Make Me Choose,Roman M√ºller,"[Verse 1]
I met you in the middle of the spring, when I was gray and cold
And‚ÄÖI‚ÄÖdid things I‚ÄÖstill regret, I just can't let‚ÄÖit go
Why don't you cut me loose, why do you make me choose, between
But the fact is, this is growing old

Like a lost ghost in the night
If you want me, you'll have to fight
Just like you know, it is true
I want you, don't make me choose

[Chorus]
I love you, don't make me choose
But the fact is, this is growing old
I love you, don't make me choose
I want you, don't make me choose

[Verse 2]
I met you in the middle of chaos, drunk on the dance floor
I can't understand, you're the girl I kissed before
Why did I go so blue, why didn't I ask you, for your feelings
In your eyes I'll still be young as, I grow gray and old

[Chorus]
I love you, don't make me choose
But the fact is, this is growing old
I love you, don't make me choose
I want you, don't make me choose

14275,Addicted,Alex Parker,"[Pre-Hook: Pharrell]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Hook: Pharrell]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I don't have a problem with multi-taskin'
Takin' care of you is my number one passion
Put it before my eyes, you know I'ma smash it
Only if you want it, want it
You don't have to ever think about askin'
I can read your mind, girl, of course I have it
Can I start you up? It's automatic
Get your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
I'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty
Ain't gotta ask me to
Surprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty
Ain't gotta ask me to

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Alex Parker]
I told you you're a unicorn, posing in human uniform
Woman, I just don't think that you get it
See, you will always be art to me
And I will, myself, be a connoisseur
Girl even sounds of your snores
Make me zoom like the Commodores
I'm, over the moon
Under the influence
Of this drug you exude
You're a hallucinogen
And I think I'm addicted
I will never be lucid again
You removed negativity
Substituted with zen
And I'll tell you
O-o, over again
Just how important you are
And how much of a difference
You've made in just seven days
Girl, what an experience
I feel I'm weaker and stronger
Quieter, louder
Inward and outward
None- and all the above
I am other
Woman I really think that you may be my superpower
I am Dr. Manhattan and I can never be human again
We just fit together
And this has just been the best week ever

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
I don't have a problem meetin' mama and daddy
Honey and sugar, man I bet they're so classy
Half of me is good, the other half nasty
Can't help it if I want it, want it
Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior
Talk about relationships, I used to be a player
And like GEICO, the time I saved 'em
And get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
Lift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown
Ain't gotta ask me to
And right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it
Ain't gotta ask me to

Taking all the clouds away from view
And when my thoughts start to betray me
My emotions going crazy
I can walk on water with you

Feels like I got too much to do
But I can be at rest when I'm with you
When I can't find my way back home
I can see the light when I'm with you

With you, with you
With you, with you
Was scared to let you know my dreams came true
From all the days I've had this year
The best were all the ones I spent with you

14256,Blind,Eric√©,"[Verse 1]
I lost my eyes in the Harlan pits in the year of '56
While pulling a faulty drill chain that was out of fix
It bounded from the wheel and there concealed my doom
I am a blind fiddler far from my home

[Verse 2]
I went up into Louisville to visit Dr. Laine
He operated on one of my eyes still it is the same
The Blue Ridge can't support me, it just ain't got the room
Would a wealthy colliery owner like to hear a fiddler's tune?

[Verse 3]
With politics and threatening tones the owners can control
And the unions have all left us a long, long time ago
Machinery lying scattered, no drill sounds in the mine
For all the good a collier is, he might as well be blind

[Verse 4]
Was a time I worked a long fourteen for a short eight bucks a day
You're lucky if you're mining, that's what the owners say
And if you've got complaining, you'd better aim to keep it low
How come they took my food stamps, does anybody know?

[Verse 5]
My father was a miner's son, a miner still is he
But his eyes have took a fever, and there's a shaking in his knee
The holes are closing rapidly, he cannot understand
A machine's got a bigger arm than him or any other man

[Verse 6]
Plastic for the windows, cardboard for the door
Baby's mouth is twisting, it'll twist a little more
""They need welders in Chicago"" falls hollow to the floor
How many miners made that trip a thousand times or more?

[Verse 7]
The lights are burning bright, there's laughter in the town
But the streets are dark and empty, there ain't a miner to be found
They're in some lonesome hollow where the sun refuse to shine
And the baby's screams are muffled in the sweetness of the wine

[Verse 8]
With a wife and four young children depending now on me
Whatever can I serve them with? My God, I cannot see
Through the Blue Ridge Mountains I am content to roam
Yes, I am a blind fiddler, far from my home
Yes, I am a blind fiddler, far from my home

14312,Yellow Lights,Natania,"You spend the nights you won‚Äôt spend the days
We get so close then you‚Äôre far away
You‚Äôre such a flirt but you‚Äôre such a flake
You say almost, I just say ok

If green means go and red means no
Speed it up or let me go
Giving signals on the low
But I don‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt know

You give me Yellow lights
I can‚Äôt stay in between all of these
Blurry lines
Can‚Äôt you say what you mean
All of these sleepless nights
Think we won‚Äôt, shit we might
Baby you must like all these yellow lights

We could be speeding down the 405
But bumper to bumper boy is what you like
Every time I try to walk away
Something bout your body makes me stay
So Hit the gas or pump the brakes

If green means go and red means no
Speed it up or let me go
Giving signals on the low
But I don‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt know

You give me Yellow lights
I can‚Äôt stay in between all of these
Blurry lines
Can‚Äôt you say what you mean
All of these sleepless nights
Think we won‚Äôt, shit we might
Baby you must like all these yellow lights

Y-e-l-l-idk
Should I stay or should I go
Dead end or an open road
Y-e-l-l-idk

You give me Yellow lights
I can‚Äôt stay in between all of these
Blurry lines
Can‚Äôt you say what you mean
All of these sleepless nights
Think we won‚Äôt, shit we might
Baby you must like all these yellow lights

Es una lanza que traspasa

Cuando callas, cuando hablas
Cuando amas

Cuando logras estrujarme
Con fascinaci√≥n
No pretendo alejarme no quiero
Yo no puedo porque te quiero as√≠
As√≠, as√≠...

Tu amor es tan ap√°tico
Tan l√∫cido, rom√°ntico

Es una mezcla singular
Te arrulla, te desvela

Setting ambitions on things far from view
No kind of distance pries a wolf from the moon

14319,Muscle Memory,Natania,"I've been doing great
Living gold days
Working on reconstructing
Put a lot on my plate
Right out the gate
So I don't start self-destructing
My idle mind is like your plaything
This vicious cycle isn't breaking

I got all these new friends
We go out on the weekends
Bought those Doctor Martens
I sublet my apartment

But I'm still hit with muscle memory
When it's quarter to three
My hands remember reaching for you
It's my co-dependency, my muscle memory
My heart remembers beating for you

When I was stressed I call you to vent
Now it's just overwhelming
Still write those texts, just don't press send
Stupid and it isn't helping

I'm a lost cause in the making
This vicious cycle isn't breaking

I got all these new friends
We go out on the weekends
Bought those Doctor Martens
I sublet my apartment

But I'm still hit with muscle memory
When it's quarter to three
My hands remember reaching for you
It's my co-dependency, my muscle memory
My heart remembers beating for you

I got all these new friends
We go out on the weekends
But I'm still hit, hit

But I'm still hit, hit
But I'm still hit, hit

Trust you to keep 'em
Hiding the worlds
You cannot say

[Verso 1]
Yo no s√© por qu√© raz√≥n cantarle a ella
Si deb√≠a aborrecerla con las fuerzas de mi coraz√≥n
Todav√≠a no la borro totalmente
Ella siempre est√° presente como ahora en esta canci√≥n
Incontables son las veces que he tratado
De olvidarla y no he logrado
Arrancarla ni un segundo de mi mente
Porque ella sabe todo mi pasado
Me conoce demasiado y es posible que por eso se aproveche

[Coro]
Porque yo en el amor soy un idiota
Que ha sufrido mil derrotas
Que no tengo fuerzas para defenderme
Pero ella casi siempre se aprovecha
Unas veces me desprecia
Y otras veces lo hace para entretenerme y es as√≠

[Verso 2]
A√∫n recuerdo la canci√≥n que le hice un d√≠a
Que en el fondo no sab√≠a que eso era malo para m√≠
Poco a poco fui cayendo en un abismo
Siempre me pas√≥ lo mismo
Nadie sabe lo que yo sufr√≠
Una victima total de sus antojos
Pero un d√≠a abr√≠ los ojos
Y con rabia la arranqu√© de mi memoria
Poco a poco fui saliendo hacia adelante
Y en los brazos de otra amante
Pude terminar al fin con esta historia

[Coro]
Porque yo en el amor soy un idiota
Que ha sufrido mil derrotas
Que no tengo fuerzas para defenderme
Pero ella casi siempre aprovechaba
Si alg√∫n d√≠a me besaba
Eso era solo para entretenerme y es as√≠

Porque pensaba que era buena
Todo fue as√≠, ay, Dios
Todo fue por ella
Yo era capaz de subir al cielo
Para bajarle un mont√≥n de estrellas
Todo fue as√≠
Todo fue por ella
Un pajarito que iba volando
Yo lo cog√≠ para complacerla
Todo fue as√≠, ay, Dios
Todo fue por ella
Tanto se burl√≥ de m√≠

Driving, late night
Seems like the end of the road, oh
Maybe turn back
But that's not how it goes, how it goes
And I gave what I could
But I know that it just wasn't enough
And it's for the best
But it's hard to sleep at night
Tired of slipping and tripping
Concrete staring up
Why be naive
When all we do is fight?

It was that night

There ain't no wrong or right
It wasn't you
These mistakes take two

Driving down the wrong road
Playing games and feeling low
Messing with my mind

How'd you do it this time?
Don't know where it all goes
Leaving me behind

Can you take a step back?
Tired of playing catch up
Would it really hurt you that much?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's right in front of your face
Yet you look the wrong way
Can you feel my touch?

But it feels like every time
You look at me that way
You feel the love in your heart
But you don't know what to say

[Chorus]
I'm tired of playing games
Let's throw the board away
Oh can you give love a try
Even if it's for a day?

[Verse]
Threw away your first chance
What happened to our romance?
Let's do it a second time

I can't stand here all day
Soon I'll look the other way
Why can't you just be mine?

Let's embrace the sunshine
Winter's gone and you'll be fine
Darling let's believe in us

[Pre-Chorus]
It's right in front of your face
Yet you look the wrong way
Can't you feel my touch?

But it feels like every time
You look at me that way
You feel the love in your heart
But you don't know what to say

[Chorus]
I'm tired of playing games
Let's throw the board away
Oh can you give love a try
Even if it's for a day?

Oh can we give love a try?
Oh can we give love a try?

You look at me that way
You feel the love in your heart

Picking phones up late at night but I want more
I miss the way that you would talk me off the ledge
You knew me better than I ever knew myself

This is me trying to get you out of my head
This is me findin' that I'm not done with us yet

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I've been kissing mouths like they were yours
I've been kissing mouths like they would
Cure me like you used to do
'Cause I'm so sick of wanting you
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I've been kissing mouths but I want yours

I've been kissing bottles ever since you left
Nowadays I only drink what you would get
You're the only substance that could substitute
So until you come back to me this will have to do

This is me trying to get you out of my head
This is me findin' that I'm not done with us yet

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Qu√© vueltas da la vida
Yo me sent√≠a perdida
No ve√≠a luz, no ve√≠a nada, no ve√≠a‚ÄÖsalida
Hasta‚ÄÖque descubr√≠ que‚ÄÖhay otro mundo all√° afuera
El que‚ÄÖme negaste t√∫, me escondiste t√∫

Donde est√°n las mujeres que les gusta bailar

Las que salen pa‚Äô la calle a gozar

Pa' las tranquilas, y las inquietas, las que llevan todo anotado en la libreta

14354,Castigo,Srta. Dayana,"[Letra de ""Por Cuba la Que Me Vio Nacer""]

[Intro]
¬°Lev√°ntate!
Dedicaci√≥n para todos mis hermanos de Cuba
Que pasan por un momento triste, doloroso y de sufrimiento y desesperaci√≥n
Quiero que sepas que no est√°s solo
Hay una voz que nos escucha
Hay una voz que siempre es de lucha
En dedicaci√≥n a mi patria querida Cuba
La que me vio nacer

La que me vio nacer est√° llorando sangre, tiene miedo
Hay que hechar pa'lante
La que m–µ vio nacer no tengo n√° que darl–µ, s√≥lo el coraz√≥n
Como cantante
Que Dios te bendiga
Que Dios te bendiga
Si hay que morirse contigo
Yo te entrego mi vida

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reir, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste t√∫ la que me vio nacer

Yo soy la calle, soy los adoquines, yo soy la bandera
Yo soy el pueblo en los escombros tirados en la carretera
Soy las ra√≠ces, soy las cicatrices, yo soy la cantera
Yo soy cubano y Cuba corre dentro de mis venas
Yo soy la casa que cay√≥
El suelo que se quebranta
El √°rbol que resisti√≥
El nudo en esta garganta
El techo que se desplom√≥ y todo el pueblo lo levanta
¬°Somos Cuba! y Cuba no se espanta

La isla que me vio nacer
Lev√°ntense que hoy es un nuevo amanecer
Un nuevo obst√°culo para brincar
Juntos vamos a vencer
Somos m√°s fuertes y aunque el diablo quiera hacer el mal
Somos hijos de Dios
Y por ende, eso no va a pasar
Soy cubano y en nombre de Cuba exsorto a mis paisanos
A que trabajemos juntos y juntos darnos la mano
Tanta presi√≥n en el hombre que a veces nos equivocamos
Un trabajo en equipo es org√°nico y m√°s sano
Nos ca√≠amos, nos levantamos y de cero se empieza
No se depriman, sigan pa'lante, abran las puertas
Reciban la ayuda que con el coraz√≥n le mandamos
Y que Jehov√° bendiga a mi pa√≠s y a mis hermanos
Mis condolencias pa' los familiares de los fallecidos
Y una recuperaci√≥n pronta pa' todos los heridos
Pu√±o arriba todo el que est√© conmigo por la que me vio nacer
Fuerza de coraz√≥n le pido

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reir, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste t√∫ la que me vio nacer

Nunca es tarde si la dicha es buena
Siempre hay calma tras de la tormenta
Si la m√∫sica en tu pecho suena
Y te cura el dolor y la pena
Nunca es tarde si t√∫ est√°s conmigo
Nunca es tarde si yo estoy contigo
Con tu mirada t√∫ me das amor
Si tienes fr√≠o yo te presto abrigo

L√°grimas en los ojos del que se siente cubano
Es que somos uno solo donde quiera que estamos ¬°S√≠!
Y lo que sufre uno lo sufrimos todos
Como buen vecino, codo con codo
No tengo mucho pero todo te lo doy
Micha presente como cubano que soy
Lo que se perdi√≥ ayer, lo recuperamos hoy
No me olvido de donde vengo
Por eso estoy donde estoy
Se acabo el mundo por la madrugada
Fue de sorpresa nadie lo esperaba
Arrancando techos, puertas y ventanas
Parece que el diablo paso por La Habana
Pero all√° arriba hay un Dios que est√° chequeando
Minuto a minuto en el mundo lo que est√° pasando
Esto es una pesadilla, pell√≠scame que estoy so√±ando
Pero es incre√≠ble, nos estamos recuperando

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio re√≠r, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste t√∫ la que me vio nacer

S√© que sientes el dolor como lo siento yo
Ante un golpe tan atroz no queda aqu√≠ en un coraz√≥n, no, no
S√≥lo te pido, hermano, estr√©chale la mano
A ese que hoy sufre y en segundos lo ha perdido todo

Esa isla del Caribe que ahora yace desolada
Merece nuestro respeto como madre dedicada
All√≠ vi mis d√≠as primeros y ella me tom√≥ en sus brazos
Las l√°grimas se me saltan cuando la veo en pedazos

Mi verdad es sincera desde lo m√°s profundo de mi coraz√≥n
Hoy estoy cantando para toda mi naci√≥n
Para mi tierra querida donde yo nac√≠
Esa misma tierra a la que le sirvi√≥ Mart√≠
Necesitamos m√°s ayuda y menos bober√≠a
No la falta de fe y tanta griter√≠a
Necesitamos la verdad y que no nos juzguen tanto
Y arreglar lo que haya que arreglar para que cese el llanto

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reir, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste t√∫ la que me vio nacer

No cierres tu coraz√≥n si gozas de la solvencia
S√© que mucho te cost√≥, pero llama a tu consciencia
Donde m√°s ha ca√≠do del dolor de la indigencia
Llev√°ndole nuestra ayuda con amor y transparencia
Cuando el pu√±o est√° cerrado no se puede dar la mano
El que sufre, el que padece
Ese tambi√©n es tu hermano
En momentos como este podemos hacer que solo
Apartando divisiones, brille un mundo mejor
Ayudar aunque est√© lejos ahora es el mejor momento
Los de adentro y los de afuera, combatiendo un sufrimiento
Mostremos a los hermanos la fuerza del sentimiento
Cuando de verdad se ama, porque de Dios es el tiempo

Lev√°ntate, comienza de cero
Vive la vida, empieza de nuevo
Lev√°ntate, eh eh eh eh eh eh
Lev√°ntate, eh eh eh eh eh eh

Junto con las voces de desesperaci√≥n
Mi pueblo grita
Y con mucha fe y esperanza infinita
¬°Uni√≥n! Es lo que mi pueblo necesita
¬°Uni√≥n! Y con sangre en nuestra historia esta escrita
Quisiera que me entierren en la que me vio nacer
Con mi pueblo y su gente
Porque nacimos con el coraz√≥n valiente
Y pa' que el mundo nos vea
Ni un hurac√°n nos gana la pelea
Y cuando la cosa se pone fea
Mi Cuba siempre pichea, siempre pichea
Ning√∫n desastre natural te quita el encanto
Por eso te hicimos este canto
Mi tierra linda, te amo tanto, te amo tanto

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reir, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste t√∫ la que me vio nacer

Yo le canto a la tierra donde nac√≠
Donde me levante, donde me ca√≠
Donde todos mis amigos a√∫n siguen ah√≠
S√© que aun me necesitan y ya estoy aqu√≠
Lo poco que me queda yo te lo dar√©
Le pido a los m√≠os que no pierdan la fe
En las buenas y las malas yo siempre estar√©
Y que cosas como estas no sucedan otra vez
A los que sufren yo les doy mis bendiciones
A los que se fueron los llevo en mis oraciones
Llego la hora de ponerse los pantalones
Y hacer lo que se supone
Juntemos las voces que mi Cuba se levanta
Yo regalo m√∫sica, por eso se le canta
Y contar un sue√±o bien bonito que me encanta
Que estaba en mi azotea y lanzaba al aire una paloma blanca

Llora, llora y desah√≥gate
Llora, llora, pero lev√°ntate
Llora, llora que yo llorar√©
Llora, llora, pero lev√°ntate
Me he ca√≠do muchas veces
Y todas esas veces que he ca√≠do, he llorado
Y yo he llorado, pero nunca ha sido en vano
Me he levantado, porque soy cubano

Soy un congo que vino de la loma
Yo soy carabal√≠
Tata enkisee, siete rayos, Yoruba
Gallo kikirik√≠
Soy qui√±ongo, babalawo
Soy Ocha con coraz√≥n de pobre
Y con la bendici√≥n de su madre
La Caridad del Cobre

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio re√≠r, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste t√∫ la que me vio nacer

Yo sacrific√≥ mis manos y mi amor
Pa' aquel que le haga falta, doy el coraz√≥n
Voy a dar mi palabra y a donar mi voz
Por todo lo triste que pas√≥
Mi cura es la pena del ca√≠do
Olvidarme es imposible
Las historias de mi Malec√≥n
Y el Morro viejo que vive

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio re√≠r, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste t√∫ la que me vio nacer
La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio re√≠r, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste t√∫ la que me vio nacer
La que me vio nacer

¬°Que Dios los bendiga!

Lo que siento yo por dentro
Nunca‚ÄÖse‚ÄÖlo digo a‚ÄÖnadie
No soy bueno en los detalles

Llegaste a cambiar a mi memoria
Porque tus ojitos me enamoran

Qu√© se siente amar a otra persona

Y a ti

Y mandarte rosas de todos colores
Tomarte la mano y verte sonre√≠r

Y a ti
A ti s√≠ me nace decirte te quiero
Y te lo confieso, el mayor de mis miedos

14355,Amor de Verdad,Dama,"(INTRO)
Dispuesto a darte amor de verdad
Te pido una oportunidad
Todo lo que tengo cari√±o sincero
Los sentimientos de un rapero

(VERSO 1: KROWELL)
Estoy en casa pensando a diario
Si me dijeras que s√≠, yo ya no ser√≠a de barrio
Mucha gente me critica porque soy un pandillero
Pero tu bien sabes que yo a ti te quiero

Vivo en el guetto porque all√≠ tengo
Lo que en mi casa no tengo
Y lo que tengo no lo quiero
Pero solo por ti y mi familia mu–µro
Por ti yo ser√≠a capaz
De dejar las gu–µrras y vivir en paz

Pero como s√© que no quieres hacerme caso
Por eso mis intentos solo son fracasos

Yo solo quiero estar entre tus brazos
Y si morir√≠a hoy, en este momento me dieran de balazos
En el cuerpo
Y si yo me fuera, me ir√≠a contento

(CORO)
Dispuesto a darte amor de verdad
Tan solo te pido una oportunidad
Darte todo lo que tengo cari√±o sincero
Dedicarte mil versos
Sentimientos de un rapero (X2)

(VERSO 2: GRISER NSR)
Te doy el universo que de frente no me atrevo
Es un sentimiento quiz√°s es algo nuevo
No s√© qu√© pasa cuando te miro pasar
Se me eriza la piel, me dan ganas de gritar

De pedirte que me des una oportunidad
De estar a tu lado, huir de mi soledad
De decirte que me encantas y mi miedo es m√°s enorme
Con tan solo un hola no me quedo conforme

No me quedo conforme porque quiero ser tu mundo
Quiero que me quieras, que sientas algo profundo
Sentimiento de un rapero
Que te quiero, te prefiero
Me refiero que sin ti me muero

Me muero porque siento que te amo
Y aun no somos nada
Y es que, que linda te ves sin tu cara maquillada
Cari√±o sincero te estoy ofreciendo
No dudes y ve, mi amor va creciendo

(CORO)
Dispuesto a darte amor de verdad
Tan solo te pido una oportunidad
Darte todo lo que tengo cari√±o sincero
Dedicarte mil versos
Sentimientos de un rapero (X2)

(KROWELL)
Estoy en casa pensando, escribiendo en mi libreta
Yo no soy como los dem√°s por favor ya dat√© cuenta
Muchos intentan, te ilusionan, te lastiman
Yo no soy la rosa que tiene las espinas
No creas que yo soy malo, solo porque soy de barrio
Yo solo escribo canciones de lo que vivo a diario
Solo tengo un defecto
Que no soy perfecto
Pero a las damas yo las trato con respeto

(GRISER NSR)
Respeto a una dama
Que no solo son pa' llevarlas a la cama
Todo un caballero
Aunque sea rapero
Ella es hermosa
Como una rosa
Chica maravillosa

Y cuando te apagan la luz te pone' intensa

Tu me vuelves loco (loco, loco)

Tu me vuelves loco (loco, loco)
Tu me vuelves loco (loco, loco)

Me gustas tal y como est√°s

Me gustan tus defectos, tus virtudes
Cuando bajas, cuando subes
Los latidos de este loco coraz√≥n
Me gusta como besas t√∫ mi boca
Y ver volar la ropa por nuestra habitaci√≥n
(Mario Guerrero, Anthony Albert
Esto s√≠ que es amor del bueno)

Me gustan tus defectos, tus virtudes
Cuando bajas, cuando subes
Los latidos de este loco coraz√≥n
Me gusta como besas t√∫ mi boca
Y ver volar la ropa por nuestra habitaci√≥n
Me gustan tus locuras (Tus man√≠as)
De ti me gusta todo (Todo, todo)
Me gusta que no llegues y te tenga que esperar (Toda la vida)
Para mi t√∫ est√°s perfecta (Tan perfecta)
Tu vienes tan bien hecha (Tan bien hecha)
No hay nada que cambiar
Me gusta tal y como est√°s
Cuando a veces me preguntas
Si hay algo que te cambiar√≠a
Sin darle mucha vuelta, sabes, yo te dir√≠a

14390,Sabotaje,Karlos Ros√©,"[Letra de ""Sabotaje""]

[Intro]
Siento que de tanto que te vi en la idea
Me perd√≠ por afanoso
En ti no hay verdad
Qu√© penosa realidad

[Verso 1]
T√∫ nunca cambiaste
Aquella vida no dejaste
Vanidosa
Ay pobre de ti
Sigues siendo poca cosa
Al fin, otra

[Pre-Coro]
Mentira es tu juego y una carta m√°s
Que usaste a gusto y antojo
Pero este apostador
Se liber√≥ y al fin al calor

[Coro]
Lamento haberte conocido
No quiero ya nada contigo
Que t√∫ me tienes cansado
Siempre terminas en lo mismo
Recuper√© ya lo perdido
Solo desgracia he conseguido
Reparar√© el da√±o
Solo tu sabotaje he sido

[Verso 2]
Cre√≠ cambiarte pero es tu manera de ser
El sol con un dedo es imposible esconder
(Qu√© da√±o) fiarte mi confianza
(Mi fallo) entregu√© todo por nada

[Pre-Coro]
Mentira es tu juego y una carta m√°s
Que usaste a gusto y antojo
Pero este apostador
Se liber√≥ y al fin al calor

Lamento haberte conocido
No quiero ya nada contigo
Que t√∫ me tienes cansado
Siempre terminas en lo mismo
Recuper√© ya lo perdido
Solo desgracia he conseguido
Reparar√© el da√±o

Lamento haberte conocido

Ya s√© que fui yo quien te pidi√≥

No s√© bien porque y c√≥mo pas√≥

Ahora que mi coraz√≥n quiere olvidarte
Mi cabeza empieza a justificarte
Y ya que t√∫ eres experto en enga√±arme
Dime algo que no tenga vuelta atr√°s
Quiz√° que lleve un poco de verdad

En este film velado en blanca noche
El hijo tenaz de tu enemigo
El muy verdugo cena distinguido
Una noche de cristal que se hace a√±icos

Y no lo so√±√©
Se enderez√≥ y brind√≥ a tu suerte
Y no lo so√±√©
Y se ofreci√≥ mejor que nunca
No mires por favor y no prendas la luz
La imagen te desfigur√≥

Este film da una imagen exquisita
Chicos son como bombas peque√±itas
El mejor camino a la cueva del perico
Para tipos que no duermen por la noche

Y no lo so√±√©
Ibas corriendo a la deriva
Y no lo so√±√©
Los ojos ciegos bien abiertos
No mires por favor y no prendas la luz
La imagen te desfigur√≥

El montaje final es muy curioso
Es en verdad realmente entretenido
Vas en la oscura multitud desprevenido
Tiranizando a quienes te han querido

Y no lo so√±√©
Ibas corriendo a la deriva
Y no lo so√±√©
Los ojos ciegos bien abiertos
Y no lo so√±√©
Ibas corriendo a la deriva
Y no lo so√±√©

No mires por favor y no prendas la luz

Mantengo‚ÄÖmi promesa

Y el nuevo Lamborghini rojo

¬°Ay! este a√±o s√≠ dejo de fumar
Y tanta rumba con mis amigos
Lleg√≥ el momento e‚Äô ponerme a ahorrar
Que se enderece al fin mi camino

Figura bicicleta

Y que coja fundamento
De inventar mentira y cuento
Alejarme de los vicios
Y pegarme al ejercicio
Aunque todo se descuadre (uy)

No se preocupe compadre
Que yo le pago con juicio
Voy a hacer el sacrificio
Para que usted se desvare

Que yo le voy a pagar

Si la casa no la compro
Si la rumba no me deja
Si la visa se me a√±eja
Y si las promesas rompo

Si en la cicla no me monto
Si el carrito se embolata
Si los impuestos me matan
No me ponga un abogado (ae)

Que aunque est√© bien embalado
Yo le consigo su plata
Deme una espera y se aguanta
Igual que el a√±os pasado
Deme una espera y se aguanta
Igual que el a√±os pasado

El cuerpo listo pa‚Äô pasarla a bien
Le pongo hielito‚ÄÖa‚ÄÖmi escoc√©s
La noche‚ÄÖpinta buena y yo lo s√©

Llegu√©‚ÄÖa la discoteca
Esa mirada coqueta creo que me cambi√≥ la vida
Bailamos la noche entera
Luego hicimos el amor y con el sol la despedida...

La primera noche, prob√© de su cuerpo y me enamor√©
Y en solo una noche con par de tequilas yo la conquist√©
Y les confieso que muero de ganas de verla otra vez

El s√°bado solo quer√≠a dormir
Pero la luna me invit√≥ a salir
Llegue con mis amigos a aquel bar
No imaginaba lo que iba a pasar

De repente vi esa hembra
Le dije usted no se ofenda
Pero est√° hecha a mi medida

Hablamos de todo un poco
Y entre tragos y miradas termino ella siendo mia

La primera noche, prob√© de su cuerpo y me enamor√©
Y en solo una noche y par de palabritas yo la conquist√©
Y les confieso me muero de ganas por verla otra vez

D√©jenme contarles la mejor
A mi el domingo me trajo el amor
En la playa yo la conoc√≠
Nadando entre sus besos yo me vi

Y en un bote de vela
Le pint√© con acuarela estrellitas en el mar
Imag√≠nense, la escena despertamos en la arena
As√≠ como Eva y adan

La primera noche, prob√© de su cuerpo y me enamor√©
Y en solo una noche y un par de besitos yo la conquist√©
Y les confieso me muero de ganas por verla otra vez

No puedo creer lo que mis ojos est√°n viendo, acabo de verla entrar con otro hombre y darle un beso

Mis amigos es la misma que en el bar yo conoc√≠
Y el Domingo fue solita para mi...

El fin de semana prob√© de su cuerpo y me enamor√©
Y en solo una noche y un par de tequilas yo la conquist√©
Y les confieso ya no tengo ganas
Y yo tampoco ya no tengo ganas
Y les confieso ya no tengo ganas... de verla otra vez

Pillando de la vida y sus detalles

Told my mama that I met a girl
That I wanna make my wife
She sleepy, but she come and see me

I wanna take a bite, Klondike
You the only one I want in my life
She sweet and sexy, thick and independent
Lookin' at your jeans like, ""How you get up in it?"" baby

I can't live a day without you
And I swear, you're like a dream come true
And after all, all of the things we've been through

Told my daddy

In need of something green to sleep at night

I've been running from the pain
Trying not to feel the same
But it's a shame that we're sinking
See, my confidence is shaking
And my heart is feeling vacant
So you try to fill it in

[Pre-Chorus]
You say ""I could fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving, darling""
But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark
I got faith in nothing

But love, pray for me
I never had somebody
So I don't know how to love
Pray for me
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love

I know it's been a while
Cause my memory's on trial
For the way I used to be
My head is running miles
Round in circles and I try
To find the little light in me

You say ""I could fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving, darling""
But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark

So you say you wanna get away
We don't need a plane
I could be your escape
Take you to a place
Where there's no time, no space
I could be your private island
On a different planet
Anything could happen
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain

[Chorus]
I could be your fantasy
(Anything could happen, anything could happen)
I could be your fantasy
(Anything could happen, anything could happen)
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Sure you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves
Listen to the waves

[Verse 2]
So you say you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight
Let yourself unwind, get lost
In the garden of my mind
I could be your private island
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain

[Chorus]
I could be your fantasy
(Anything could happen, anything could happen)
I could be your fantasy
(Anything could happen, anything could happen)
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Sure you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves
Listen to the waves

We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

¬øComo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I‚ÄÖknew‚ÄÖthe song
A young‚ÄÖgirl with eyes like the desert
It‚ÄÖall seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical, the island breeze
All‚Åüof‚Åünature‚Åüwild and free
This‚Åüis where I‚Åülong to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical, the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Drop]

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical, the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

14542,Expectations,Glaceo,"A pretty girl with a lit cigarette and a Led Zep t-shirt
Told me
""Don't read in this a one-night stand
Don't make no plans just hold me
Don't tell me that you love me when you just gonna run out of this bed in the morning
'Cause I don't see us sippin' coffee, no
I just see us taking off our clothes""
She said, ""I'm used to this by now
See, I've been getting used to being let down

[Chorus]
And, baby, I've got expectations
That every guy just wants me naked
And every night we'll end up faking love
And, baby, I've made adaptations
From thinking love should come with patience
To knowing love's just something boy's made up""¬†

And she said
""I'm pretty sure that you're just my type with your hat flipped backwards
Aw, yeah
Bet you like how I wear this dress, but it's better on my bedroom floor
So save your time and your lines cause we both know where this ends up
In the morning
'Cause I don't see you growing on me, no
I just see us taking off our clothes

And, baby, I've got expectations
That every guy just wants me naked

14536,San Francisco,Yann Muller,"[Intro]
Yo
This is the owner of KungFood Restaurant
After I got broken into seven times
AceKing got broke into once, man
I ain't got no choice but to record this diss track
Aye last time I checked, Chinese in this country does have these constitutional rights
So, that's the beauty of music
I'm about to drop this bitch, go!

[Chorus]
San Francisco, that's my home
Let me put it in the song so you never get wrong
That's the city by the bay, that's where I grew up
No matter where I'm at that's this place I love

San Francisco, that's my hom–µ
Let me put it in the song so you n–µver get wrong
That's the city by the bay, that's where I grew up
No matter where I'm at that's this place I love

[Verse]
Now everybody let me see your hands in the air
Now throw your two middle fingers up to the mayor
I'm trying to run a business in the S.F.C
A punk-ass tweaker keep on messing with me

I'm just a man trying to provide for my son and my daughter
In the city with law and order, I'm barely making a quarter
Out of fifteen cent. It's hard to be a man
With crooked politicians want to see me getting burnt

Now London Breed, you ain't nothing but a clown
When we really needed you you would never be around
You done turned this great city into the zombie land
Lived through all kinds of dirts here- won't try in a small town

This just how I feel, I gotta keep it real
This ain't no fairy tale, my people are getting killed
You might be thinking I'm just another joke
You don't believe what I said, take a trip to the T.L

[Chorus]
San Francisco, that's my home
Let me put it in the song so you never get wrong
That's the city by the bay, that's where I grew up
No matter where I'm at that's this place I love

San Francisco, that's my home
Let me put it in the song so you never get wrong
That's the city by the bay, that's where I grew up
No matter where I'm at that's this place I love

[Verse]
You know I'm a hundred percent down with the Black Lives Matter
But what about our grandmother, what about our grandfather
They're getting attacked, they're getting robbed
They're getting killed and the DA just dropped another murder charge

I'm sick and tired of dealing with the phony-ass liberal
They acting like they care but never treated us as equal
My people been here for over two hundred years
So save your fake sympathy, your crocodile tears

I'm sick and tired of Asians being kicked onto the curb
Justice for Granpa Vicha, Little Jasper, never served
I wish I could be calling out all of their names
We ought to do whatever to make sure they didn't die in vain

Ain't nothing going to change if we remain silent
Now father please help us to stop all the violence
Now every night I pray to go back to the old day
When the bay was the greatest city in the whole states

[Outro]
If you are going to San Francisco
Make sure to leave nothing in your car

If you are going to San Francisco
Make sure you leave no money in your purse

What would you do
To get to me
What would you say
To have your way
Would you give up
Or try again
If I hesitate
To let you win
Or would you be yourself
Or play your role
Tell all the boys
Or keep it low
If I say no
Would you turn away
Or play me off
Or would you say no

If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Try again

[Verse 2]
I'm into you
You into me
But I can‚Äôt let it go so easily
Not 'til I see
What this could be
Be eternity, or just a week
You know our chemistry is off the chain
Is perfect now, but will it change
This ain‚Äôt a yes
This ain‚Äôt a no
Just do your thing
We'll see how it goes

[Chorus]
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

[Verse 3]
If you don‚Äôt wanna throw it all away
Might be shy on the first date
What about the next date
Oh, hoh, hoh, hoh
If you don‚Äôt wanna throw it all away
You might be buggin' on the first date
But what about the next date
Oh, hoh, hoh, hoh

[Chorus]
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Try again

Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in the sandpit, life a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music played by me, the mad men

Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamond in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many advantages given up today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
Oh let them come true

[Chorus]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever and ever young

Forever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?

14503,Fed Up,LVNDSCAPE,"[Verse 1: Kevin Ford]
No, my mind ain't right
Cold, so cold last night
Alone, oh, how nice
Gold, got gold inside

[Pre-Chorus: Matthew Russel]
And every time I hear the angels sing
I get a glow around my halo
It circulates, I feel it in my veins
I'd take a hit to see the rainbow

[Chorus: Kevin Ford]
Oh my god, I'm tired of being fed up, fed up
Oh my god, I'm trying to keep my head up, my head up
Now I'm up in the clouds
The heaven's around, the trumpets are loud
Now I'm up in the clouds
The heaven's around, the trumpets are loud

[Verse 2: Kevin Ford]
No, I don't like this place
I'm making a plan so that I can escape
I'm going, I'll be gone some day
Gold, I'm on my way

And every time I hear the angels sing
I get a glow around my halo
It circulates, I feel it in my veins

Oh my god, I'm trying to keep my head up, my head up

14501,Higher Love,State of Sound,"[Verse 1]
I thought I was a dreamer
But it's not a dream
I'm falling so much deeper
Into what is real
My eyes are open and I see it
I'm no longer blind
You lead the way out of this fever
Into a peace of mind

[Chorus]
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
And I know all the pain will be over
When you carry my weight on your shoulder
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
There's a light coming on the horizon
That forever will shine like a diamond
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above

[Verse 2]
Though that I was leaving
But I got stuck between your thighs
A different kind of freedom
I wait for you to shine
I be down in heavy breathing
Wind under your wings
Deeper for you my demon
My queen of everything
And it's slowly flowing through my body can you feel it

[Chorus]
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
And I know all the pain will be over
When you carry my weight on your shoulder
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
There's a light coming on the horizon
That forever will shine like a diamond
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
Fall asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day
Fall asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day

[Chorus]
And I know all the pain will be over
When you carry my weight on your shoulder
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
There's a light coming on the horizon
That forever will shine like a diamond
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
Fell asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day
Fell asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day
Fell asleep living, wake up to

14516,Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!,GAMPER & DADONI,"And I'm watchin' the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the‚ÄÖevening‚ÄÖon my own
Blowin'‚ÄÖoutside the window
As I look around‚ÄÖthe room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
From the end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
(Tired of TV)
I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight

Hey now, you're a rock‚ÄÖstar
Get‚ÄÖthe show on,‚ÄÖget paid
And all that glitters is‚ÄÖgold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Verse 1]
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Verse 2]
The years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go)
You'll never shine if you don't glow (Hey)

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Swimming in the tide against the waves

Loud as lightning bolts that STRIKE
Rolling thunder through the NIGHT
And GO, OOO Can't stop won't stop

Drive till we see the sun
Our hearts were born to RUN GO, OOO

Just like a rolling stone
Marching in line like we've been TOLD
All the little lies that we've been sold
Keep staring down a highway made of GOLD
Picking up quick & moving FAST
Never looking down or looking back
So we can make the feeling LAST
Loud as lightning bolts that STRIKE
Rolling thunder through the NIGHT

Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon
So sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe sometimes we've
Got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change
The more they stay the same
Oh, don't you hesitate

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favourite song
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere
Somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
Just relax, just relax
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hairdo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid
But it's alright
The more you stay the same
The more they seem to change
Ooh, don't you think it's strange?

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favourite song
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere
Somehow

[Bridge]
'Twas more than I could take
Pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favourite song
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere
Somehow

Written on the back of a beer mat
When you gave your number in‚ÄÖthe‚ÄÖbar, it appeared‚ÄÖthat

It was only when I called you that I heard
That you loved me from the moment, it became clear that
I was gonna call you like I said I'd do

We spent hours on the phone
Carved our names into a stone
And we never felt alone as we walked hand in hand
There was hardly time for sorrow
Or thinking 'bout tomorrow
With liquor in a bottle of our favorite brand
I guess time was on our side
'Cause we're still not old and wise
We're still looking for a stone to carve our names
With our skin as a disguise
For our young mischievous eyes
The fire in our heart is still the same

[Chorus]
We are young, at heart
We stay alive
We are strong, 'cause love
Will save our lives
And sure we're getting older, we get older
But that won't change a thing
'Cause life cannot control her, she gets older
But love will always win
We are young

14546,I Don't Know Why,Gavin James,"[Verse 1]
I don't know why
I don't want anybody else but you
No one can ever add up to
What you are
The simple words
That I can never say to you
Things that I can never do
When I was young

[Chorus]
But I don't know
Which way the wind blows
But I know I'll be alright
And I don't know
If you think I'm crazy
But if you say maybe I
I'd say love don't wait in line
No, love don't wait in line

[Verse 2]
If I say
I don't care what you do with him
If every time I lose you win
Then I'd be lying
But I'd better learn
Oh, I'd better learn to sink or swim
Cause the pieces of my heart are getting dim
But I'll find the light

[Chorus]
And I don't know
Which way the wind blows
But I know I'll be alright
And I don't know
If you think I'm crazy
But if you say maybe I
I'd say love don't wait in line
No, love don't wait in line oooh

[Verse 3]
Times they change
And our lives they rearrange
We were just a burning flame
With bad timing

Oh but love don't wait in line
No, love don't wait in line
In line oooh

14533,Nervous,Gavin James,"[Verse 1]
I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
When we loose our winter coats in the spring
'Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
That every time I see you my heart sings
'Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

[Hook]
Oooooooooh
Ooooohohoooooh
Oooohoooooooh
Ohoooohohohoooooh

[Verse 2]
'Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet no
I didn't know the words in front of me

[Bridge]
In front of me ooh
But I don't wanna know
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Home
If I let you go

[Hook]
Oooooohhhhh
Oooooohhhhh
Oooooohhhhh
Oooooooohooooohoohhhh

[Verse 3]
Now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love you if you don't
Oh you don't

[Outro]
Oooooohhhhh
So I won't say I love you if you don't

14506,Show Me Love,Sam Feldt,"Heartbreaks and promises
I've had more than my share
I'm tired of giving my love
And getting nowhere, nowhere

It's been so long since
I've touched your wanting hand
I'll put my love on the line
Yes I hope you'll understand

So, baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, but
You've got to show me love
But, you've got to show me love

I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I need is somebody who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world
World that I already
This time, call me baby
Actions speak louder than words

If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Come, my love is guaranteed

So, baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, but
You've got to show me love
You give me reason
You've got to show me love

14547,Galway Girl,Ed Sheeran,"[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the c√©ili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And the crowds don't remember my name

Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's givin' it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore

Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

The way I did before
We don't talk anymore, oh, woah

Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore

14567,Savannah,FAULHABER,"[Verse 1]
In your deep blue eyes
I see clear blue skies
When I think of you
I wanna go back
Under purple light
We stayed up all night
And we promised then, that we‚Äôd

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on to every word that we said
Replay every moment inside of our head

[Chorus]
Savannah, I met you in the summer
I love your endless colours
I‚Äôll always be your lover
Together we got faded
Still high on love, I taste it
Got in the pool butt naked
Where magic was created
I met you in the summer

[Bridge]
I met you in the summer

[Verse 2]
When the heat is on
And we‚Äôre up till dawn
And you‚Äôre by my side
To kill the lonely nights
Just skin on skin
Under a thousand stars
And we promised there, that we‚Äôd

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on to every word that we said
Replay every moment inside of our head

[Chorus}
Savannah, I met you in the summer
I love your endless colours
I‚Äôll always be your lover

Still high on love, I taste it
Got in the pool butt naked
Where magic was created
I met you in the summer

I met you in the summer

Savannah, I met you in the summer
I love your endless colours

Got in the pool butt naked
Where magic was created
I met you in the summer

14590,Tired,Henri Purnell,"Verse 1:
Name, calling out your name
Piercing hearts untamed
Wild undying fire, bites into your mane

You're mine, you're mine, you're mine
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Of all the shit I'm told, the ashes of my bones

Chorus
I won't play your silent games
Your fucked up ways that blind my faith

Your silent games, your silent games-

I beg -

Verse 2:
Eyes that creep into my mind
With shaking feet unwind
Breathe, inhale, love building up inside

Of stories old untold
Hear me howling out my friends
Pick me up before I end

Chorus:
I won't play your silent games
Your fucked up ways that blind my faith

Your silent games, your silent games-

You're mine, you're mine, you're mine
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Of all the shit I'm told, the ashes of my bones
Of stories old untold
Hear me howling out my friends
Pick me up before I end

14597,The Sun,Meynberg,"They say there's a sun in the sky
But me I can't imagine why
There might have been one
Before you were gone
But now all I see is the night
So I don't believe in the sun
How could it shine down on everyone?
And never shine on me?
How could there be..such cruelty?
The only sun I ever knew
As the beautiful one that was you
Since you went away it's nighttime all day
And it's usually raining too
So I don't believe in the sun
How could it shine down on everyone?
Never shine on me?
How could there be..such cruelty?
The only stars there really are
Were shining in your eyes
There is no sun except the one
That never shone on other guys
The moon to whom the poets croon
Has given up and died
Astronomy will have to be revised
So I don't believe in the sun
How could it shine down on everyone?
Never shine on me?
How could there be..such cruelty?

Midnight the party won't stop, until' the moonlight
I'm skopin' out the hotties with the light eyes
Be with me tonight

V1: [R-SON]
Sing a song of six pence we about to croon
Out the wolf pack leading, howling at the moon
Ran to my gods and they grant me a boon
So I can keep on rocking till tomorrow afternoon

Keep it spicy as the sands of Dune
Stack with more flavor than a sack of macaroons
Dismiss the idea that Ran's a goon
'Cause my vocab will knock you out your pantaloons

A mixture of graffiti and Sanskrit runes
True school hip hop and old banjo tunes
Bringing in fans from all types of lands
And if you don't believe me just scan the room

Folks from Canada and Cameroon
West Bank, West Berlin, Westampton too
Home of the Koalas and the Kangaroos
They all wanna hear verses from those Randal dudes'

V2: [Dolio the Sleuth]
Haters stay hatin' but we really can't relate
Because we get so many positive vibrations
At every station that we stop, It's verified we're making it hot
Find the right spot we're taking it out

Unclassified flows you can't place in a box
Except the ones with the boom in it
Leave a little room for the movement of feet
Feel the groove when we speak
Show and prove, how we do what we do on a beat

In the booth with the heat, let loose on the street
Socialize like a Sunday afternoon in the East
When it's brunch time, get it in when it's crunch time
With metaphors galore, similes and some punch lines

Three crowd-rockers, D-R squared
If you're asking where the party is, we are there
Get live at any scene, we done seen our share
And pay no mind to naysayers, yo
We need not care

Say woah-oh-oh (Woah-oh-oh!)
Woah-oh-oh (Woah-oh-oh!)
Woah-oh-oh
We're just doing our own thing

Yeah, I'm different, yeah I'm different
With a mic and I'm backed by live instruments
With a boom bap or with a whole band
I command crowds and push the envelope like a postman

Known to bring the heat to this cold land
Unique with the flavor
'cause the ones who seem to eat can be so bland
Seasoned on the mic, yep! Feedin' off the vibes, yep!
The reason that I'm nice, 'cause there's freedom in my mind, yep!

Never picked a lane, I went off-road
Put in some elbow grease and dirtied up my washed clothes
The opposite of hostile, 'cause I'm not a lost soul
I was given a gift, not a sock of hot coal

Yo I watched a lot fold like tacos, all jokes aside
When people say that I'm dope, it keeps my hope alive
Because I heard a lot of ""Nope"" for most my life
So now I get a dose of pride knowing my flow is nice

To understand what's goin' on baby
If you see something in my eye
Let's not over analyze
Don't go too deep with it baby

So let it be
What it'll be
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I'll do
I'll play the wuss, not like we have a date with destiny

It's just
A little crush
Not like I faint, everytime we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do
Depends on you

It's raisin' my adrenalin'
You're banging on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it baby
Say ""that were for ever more""
That's not what I'm lookin' for
All I can commit to is maybe

Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill

Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
Or we could wait until the walls come down

Ooh-woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now
But I feel it still
I can feel it still

I don't give a shit
And I never will
Jintro and the great luna
And a broken man and a wronged wife
A twisted soul
And one more call for alcohol
Mingo mango
This is the day of doom
Spit your fire
I'll go down soon
But ain't you gonna tell me what you
Want me to do about wantin' you
Oh, baby
What ya want me to do

And blinds my eyes from behind

Aye, Aye
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this

Days seem longer in the summer time
I done told these niggas that the summers mine
Niggas moving forward fast -- we don‚Äôt press rewind
So Ima need y‚Äôall to catch me if I don‚Äôt fall In line
And I don‚Äôt mean that shit like single file
And after five years a nigga single now
But even after all of this shit
Still love the mother of both of my kids
I still regret all the time that I miss
I still regret everything that I did
Apologies everything that I hid
And it‚Äôs all because of a life I tried to live
I heard life is what ever that you make it
And once it‚Äôs made it‚Äôs impossible to change it nigga
Cause even if you manage to change -- all the memories remain the same
I want it so bad in a strong way
I even considered doin it the wrong way
Brighter days seem outta sight in a long way
Until then nigga ima let this song play

Aye, Aye
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this
Than this

Nights seem longer then the winter time
A nigga broke so at times I miss dinner time
I ain‚Äôt even trippin though, long as my babies eat
Long as I got my vape smoke then that‚Äôs fine with me
I think I got my family all worried
I‚Äôm losing my sense of sight this shit is scary nigga
Better yet this shit blurry
I‚Äôm at the point where anything I do can hurt me
I pray to God that my vision don‚Äôt desert me
A crazy man is the last thing that this Earth needs
And California just ain‚Äôt giving me what I need
And when I cry it be feelin' like my eyes bleed
My little cousin told me I need to find peace
Buried his brother now I wonder if we find peace
Somebody tell me something better in this life please
Somebody tell me isomething better after life please

Terayle:
Aye, Aye, Look
Now have you ever felt a spirit transition into another dimension
My older brother put me in that position
I was lookin at a body that‚Äôs stale
Another body that‚Äôs frail
Another wound ‚Äì prolly never gon‚Äô heal
Now this that same brother used to judo-flip me the yard
Same brother showed me really how to really play my cards
Same brother showed hard work from the jump
Can‚Äôt front ‚Äì me and him switchin' places all I want
I remember - December‚Äôs with little heat
So we watching Boondocks in jackets and tube socks
Playing video games every night
Throwing rocks on Webb Street
And now I‚Äôm steady livin' in hell
Now how the fuck I‚Äôm 'sposed to live when my older brother gone
He had his life together ‚Äî I was livin 'wrong
And even when it‚Äôs quiet and I‚Äôm prayin' and I‚Äôm crying for his Presence 9 times outta 9, I‚Äôm alone
Shit, it‚Äôs been a minute since I seen your face
Or heard your voice
Or smelled your scent
And I ain‚Äôt even talk to God cause I can‚Äôt rejoice
I don‚Äôt repent
I make the choice to often sin
I miss my dog, I miss my kin, I miss my boy
I miss my friend, the time we spent ‚Äî Imma never get it
The book of your life came to a close
But I guess another story begins
I gotta take it in stride ‚Äî cause every lesson applies
And every single tear I cried it eventually dried
Reminiscing on the times I was contemplating life
Now my brother is the reason that I‚Äôm staying alive
And that‚Äôs ironic because I probably spent too many hours staring at pills
I‚Äôd probably be a goner is lookin' could really kill
And now I feel ridiculous ‚Äî looking at my sisters and my mother in The eyes thanking God they who I am healing with - uh
But I don‚Äôt fuckin' get it
Man, Tevyn really gone I need fucking with it
Feelin' life was getting harder and I want to quit it
Man I swear to God in that fucking minute
He came to me
My brother came to me
It was almost like he sang to me
Yeah he sang to me
He gave his little brother advice to take the drive and the mental combined
Engineer my blue print, and I can sketch the design
Investigate you inner spirits and the realm of my mind
Before I know it, I can fill a storage unit with finds
Play the game like a coach and I'll never resign
Be a bully in this bitch, ain't no need to be kind
You fuck around and act sweet, you gon end up behind
But play your lucky stars right and you might end up aligned
Cause you can really have it all ‚Äî you gotta get up and grind
But that won‚Äôt take away the pain ‚Äî I'll keep that in mind
Cause hen I call my brothers name I just want a reply
I just really want him back, i ain‚Äôt wanna goodbye
I tell you I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know why

Much better than the life that we love
(It's gotta be better than this)
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this
Than this
(I know, I know)
It's gotta be better than this
Than this, yeah
(Aye)
I know

You know I had to do it again
(I was gonna leave it out)
Better than this
"
14594,"Money, Power",Silky Signs,"[Verse 1: Fabolous]
They call me F-A-Beezy, sometimes Stizzo
The wrist on freezy, neck on glizzo
The coupe move easy at two-double-izzo
Truck look cheezy [?]
And it's jacked up like it sit on stilettos
Can't you see the glit' on the pebbles that sit on the bezel
None of you little scraps couldn't get on my level
Take more than a hot song to try to sit on the devil
Got respect when I killed ""Money, Power"" the first time
When they tried to knock down the towers the first time
And the only reason I'm talking 'bout it
Is so you know the real talk of New York's about it
I'm with a bitch, with a tight ass that shakes
Her suck game will one gulp: White Castle shakes
Got the home right past the lake
When I came home they stop us, this time might blast the jake
I'm the nigga on the couches in clubs
And I stand out from the rest of the slouchers and scrubs
Bottles and bottles with a train of pretty hoes
That look like they could be the mains in videos
We in the caps with the Yankee logos
Blowing on the stanky dro dro, the pinky snow-globe
And you know the link be so ""oh""
Niggas look fast but the blinks be slow-mo
I could spot a kinky ho though
All hood bitch, she just tryna make you think she SoHo
Plus I know the game like the back of my hand
When I'm lazy, you can catch me in the back of sedans
When I'm gone, you can bet I'm coming back with a tan
With the Mickey D signs on the back of my pants
And I act like the man, 'cause this my time
Plus the hood say they miss my dimes, it's young money

[Verse 2: Ransom]
All you see me with is Coogi, dogs and long chains
Fucking with some bougie broads with long brain
Plus now I'm usually calm, the storm came
But still keep a toolie on like John Wayne
Catch me in the kitchen, dope bricks on the fire
Them niggas that be spittin, those pricks is some liars
Never been pitchin, sold clips to them buyers
Me? I hang on the block like broke kicks on the wire
The kid is so nasty with it
Copped a new Benz and only paid half to get it
I'm a gorilla that had to get classy with it
Your dumb bird gave me head because Fab was with us
Could care less who your bitch be feeling
I'm in a loft with nice floors and crispy ceiling
As long as I get it off and get these millions
I retire to smoke weed like Ricky Williams

[Verse 3: Hitchcock]
Now your cake is gone, niggas wanna hate the Storm
Cause they know my team reign surpreme, and I'm Jason Bourne
Catch a case Im gone, just another face to mourn
Stay down 'fore the tre-pound leave your face deformed
Listen pal, you ain't really pitching vials
Just wanna rap back and forth like 'Kiss and Styles
Every other day, you could say I be switching dials
Fourty-grand, fifty-thou, and I got the fifty-cal
It's Hitchcock, Hannibal of rap
You ain't gotta see a show to see an animal attack
Im an animal a warrior in fact
With tre snubs, repping A-dub in the corner with gats
And Im in a fast car, with a crash bar
Built in the dash part sorta like Nascar
Outlast yall because I treat the track like a cell phone
I burn it down to the last bar

[Verse 4: Stack Bundles]
You're welcome
You ain't gotta thank me for what i did to the mixtapes
Make sure the labels get my shit straight
You ain't gotta pat me on the back (back!)
Just pack me in that 'Bach ('Bach!)
With a dime, fine wine and some blinds in the back
Curtains is too extra
Though the silk shirt's fucking with my chest hairs
I'm in love with the texture
The gorgeous one has spoken, clear stones in his hair
Pink in his eyes like Jesus has awoken
It's all in the belt buckle, a mansion in that
And if you call shorty, buckle, just imagine the neck
And the trousers Mugler, the shoes is Maury
These rap niggas startin to bore me
Most MCs square, so the button-up's MC squared
I'm insulted when they offer me ears
The babes want me in [?]
And you know the boys want me in states
I'm retiring pyrex - call me Seymour Cake!

[Verse 5: Joe Budden]
Now niggas say they in the hood like Mister Softee
They in the hood getting treated like Mister Softie
‚ÄúI clap the four-fifth‚Äù, if you believe that
Then you believe Rick James died of natural causes
I'm twisting up trees-chronic to switching up ebonics
Started in the fifth grade, switching up etonics
Know a few dudes that'll spit at your dome
So go see 'em if you really want invisible stones
Try and get at me to hit him
Just type forty acres and a mule in your navi system
My hood‚Äîthey kidnapping your kids
See, we try and Tom Cruise and Jamie what collateral is
Whack dudes in the game is a problem
But they like Maurice Malone jeans, their name will stay on the bottom
Murdering that? Nah, heard him, he's sub-par
Coyote Ugly rappers, keep working at your bars

[Verse 6: Paul Cain]
Cain got the heart of a soldier, mind of a general
Strategy is important, timing is critical
We wear tracks out, lyrically I'm a beast
From Brooklyn's backbone, epitome of the streets
Only the strong survive, if you physically weak
You get gunbutted, stabbed, shot, and critically beat
'Cause listen, ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
Presidential with the matching bullet bracelet, it's a good look, man
Call me whatever, I hustle and I rap a little
You see the color stones chain look like a pack of Skittles
I give 'em anthrax, every bar is that official
I know I'm a gangster, I ain't got to pack a pistol
I don't rap in riddles, I give it to a nigga
Straight, no chaser, I'm like Hen' on the rocks
If it ain't the fifth, it's probably the Glock
I'm the nigga Clue and Duro call when they need the bodies to drop
If it ain't the chain, it's probably the watch
When I ride if it ain't the truck or sedan, it's probably the drop
Play the block, I don't party a lot
I'm the one who sent the goon with the snub to get the jewels from the club
I could never blow all my dough
When I get at least ten people robbed at all my shows
And all I know: money, clothes, birds, and cars
Running from Po's, champagne, furs, and R's
Quite sure you must've heard of the God
If not I'm Cain, Triangle Offense, I'm a third of the squad
I'm the first line of the defense, the star point guard
Is back starting, y'all be used to riding the bench
[?] fuck that ""no women, no kids"" shit
When the shotty blows, everybody goes, business is business
But dig this, fuck a guilty conscience
I'll put a slug in you, really give you something to live with
Fuck street fighting, I pull a hammer in a split second
The kid breathe fire, and speak lightning
These niggas ain't writing
All they did was analyze my flow, and use my style so their liking, nigga

[Outro: Paul Cain]
Now the year's new, I laid my game flat
I want my spot back, take two, motherfucker
"
14589,Kiss Me,Robert Falcon,"[Verse 1]
Kiss me out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You'll wear those shoes and I will wear the dress

[Chorus]
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift you open hand, strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance, steal the moon's sparkling
So kiss me

[Verse 2]
Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me, upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

[Chorus]
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift you open hand, strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance, steal the moon's sparkling
So kiss me

[Outro]
Kiss me out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You'll wear those shoes and I will wear the dress
Kiss me, so kiss me
So kiss me, kiss me
So kiss me, kiss me
So kiss me, kiss me

14598,Sunrise,On June,"[Verse 1]
Monday morning, saw my darling
Out the window, where leaves were falling
Went outside and started talking
'Til the evening, the sun was falling

[Pre-Chorus]
I pulled her towards me in that moment
Yeah, we don't care if the record player's broken

[Chorus]
So groove, groove in the moonlight
Just me and you tonight
Now move your body with mine
And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

[Verse 2]
[?] now we started driving
On the highway, when cars were honking
We pulled over, started walking
People dancing and traffic stopping

[Pre-Chorus]
I pulled her towards me in that moment
Yeah, we don't care if the car radio's broken

[Chorus]
So groove, groove in the moonlight
Just me and you tonight
Now move your body with mine
And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

[Bridge]
So groove, groove in the moonlight
Just me and you tonight
Now move your body with mine
And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

Now move your body with mine
And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

14588,Believe,ROOKIES,"[Intro]

While she lays sleeping
I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all‚ÄÖthe‚ÄÖnights can be‚ÄÖso long
And it's good when I‚ÄÖfinally make it home, all alone

[Verse 1]

I write my songs while she sleeps in my bed
Countless subjects and lyrics created in my head
Me and her are friends with benefits at most
We do a lot of action, but I don't like to boast
She's a woman that's so popular and all that
I'm just a young man who just happens to rap
But we both know our music can a lot of good
I'd spend all my time with her if I could


But whilst the two of us do get lovey and playful
I don't want an attraction, 'cause I know it could be fatal
One day, this girl could accidentally put me under 6 feet
It happened to all her exes before she met me
But I can't help but feel this way about her
Been so long, I can't picture my life without her
Even when I have to leave her behind quick snap
I know she'll wait for me to come running back

[Hook]

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong

But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I will find a way
Find a way

[Verse 2]

Oh my goodness, how I love her so much
She's the one girl that I put in all my trust
She knows what's next in the world like scripted plays
I love it when she takes my hand through her wicked ways
She hugs and kisses me whenever I make an entrance
She holds my heart captive like a prison sentence
There's no more fears, no more tears, no more lies
And there's no worries inside, when I look in her eyes

I love her so much, there's really no pretending
I press hands and pray for us to have a happy ending
When the curtain to our lives close and we take a bow
I hope we die together with no sorrow, pain or feeling down
We're such a cute couple together, yeah I know
I knew ever since I met her, 4 years ago
We hold each other's pain & such like carriers
If I get richer than I am now, maybe I'll marry her

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

With her, life feels a little less awful
My love for her will never die, it's immortal
I want her for life, and I'm being serious
This is a feeling I never thought I'd experience
The love she has for me does nothing but fulfil me
If she leaves me, the heartbreak will surely kill me
She's a work of art to me like something from David Hayes
She always adds a little sunshine to my rainy days

And this is me far from playing
This is my heart and dedication to her that I'm displaying
It feels as though we need each other for survival
If we die inside, there'll always be a revival
To spend my time with her feels rather vital
Until 'the girl of Rootes' becomes her title
With her by my side, I know I'll achieve my dreams
I love you, hip hop, and I know that you believe in me

[Hook 2]

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I will find a way
While she waits
While she waits
For me

14570,Photograph,Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
Mm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""

I keep on dancing, I don't wanna know
The world outside
There is a rhythm beating in our hearts
You can't deny

[Pre-Chorus]
So give your love, let it out
Let it be, I don't mind
Give all you got, don't be shy
Salty wave, cherry taste
Do I feel syncopate?
Give all you got to me now

Getting on a plane with a morning sun
Baby, let's pretend that it's all forgotten
I don't wanna stay where our love went wrong
I just wanna dance, wanna dance
Dance like my feet are haunted
Dance like my feet are haunted
Like my feet are haunted

Bad days are feelings only for tonight
We'll drink 'em all
A sweet illusion tells me this is right
You'll catch my fall

14641,Tale of Rise and Fall,Y.V.E. 48,"[Verse 1]
For every dreamer there's a sky
For every low there is a high
For every dancer there's a floor
For every less we try more

[Chorus]
We build bridges out of walls
And we tear our shelters down
It's up to us if we rise or if we fall
This is our trip we just have to find a road
It's always been
A tale of rise and fall
A tale of rise and fall
A tale of rise and fall

[Verse 2]
For every stranger there's a home
For every king there's a throne
From every nightmare we awake
We won't get caught
In the decisions that we make

[Chorus]
We build bridges out of walls
And we tear our shelters down
It's up to us if we rise or if we fall
This is our trip we just have to find a road
It's always been
A tale of rise and fall
A tale of rise and fall
A tale of rise and fall

14627,Strangers,GAB,"[Verse 1: Zumbi]
I‚Äôm a stranger in a home I own
Been livin‚Äô here twenty long years with my fam like a Corleone
But where did everybody go that I used to know?
I moved in back in ‚ÄòEighty-Four‚Äô
We was very ‚Äòpoor‚Äô -- wasn‚Äôt even sellin‚Äô gold weight
Just movin‚Äô in to the Gold State
I reminisce about the closed gate
That seemed to wrap around
The music that we made
It had a ghetto sound
Most cats was black and brown, in Urban areas
Was so infectious that it spread out like Malaria
New York to Cali, back to the Dirty-Dirty
We used to be sixteen, but now we pushing thirty
I seen it change early, I pulled a Jheri-Curly
On out to dready, but the next phase we wasn‚Äôt ready
It seemed enlightened as the years got longer
From black to white but the sales got stronger
We started going platinum, it was bound happen
We went pop, sleeping in beds of silk and satin
When I woke up from my sleep, pronounced
Saw the whole scene had changed, all my folks had bounced
But I ain‚Äôt leaving, ‚Äòcause I own this block
Been paying off my mortgage steady with my bonds and stock
I be buying property, till I own the block
I love hip-hop, it‚Äôs all I got

[Chorus]
There‚Äôs a stranger in my home
And he‚Äôs watching
Yeah...Yeah...Yeah
There‚Äôs a Stranger in my home
And he‚Äôs watching

[Verse 2: Gift of Gab]
There‚Äôs a stranger in my home, my house has been invaded
Went out for just a second
Came back - it ain‚Äôt the same as it was
At times I felt, could leave the door unlocked
And let all come and go as they please
But knowing that was there
When I had left, was there when I returned
New faces, replications, some styles that they have learned
Like Greeks had did Egyptians - Complex to simplified
I suddenly realized: My cribs been gentrified
And if people don‚Äôt know, then how could people come
Big money - neglect the hood, suburban promotion
From urban emotion to corporation
Who really don‚Äôt have a clue where they got they taste from
There‚Äôs a stranger in my home and my peoples is gone
And I‚Äôm feeling like the outsider standing alone
There‚Äôs a stranger in here, but the strangest thing to see
Is the way it‚Äôs looking right now, the stranger is me

[Chorus]
There‚Äôs a stranger in my home
And he‚Äôs watching
Yeah...Yeah...Yeah
There‚Äôs a Stranger in my home
And he‚Äôs watching

[Verse 3: Zumbi]
There‚Äôs a stranger in my home
Infiltrating my throne
Stop messing with my crib
Won‚Äôt leave me alone
There‚Äôs a stranger, it‚Äôs danger, the call of hip-hop culture
When you‚Äôre feeling hot, when you‚Äôre not she‚Äôs a vulture
Know that we‚Äôre supposed to protect and respect
But it‚Äôs hard to stay righteous when you needing a check
There‚Äôs a stranger in my midst
Now I‚Äôm balling my fist
I never dreamed it would come to this

[Outro Hook]
There is so much to me, so they‚Äôre following me everywhere I go
I don‚Äôt know what to do, but I gotta stay true
There‚Äôs a stranger in my home
There‚Äôs a stranger in my home
And he‚Äôs watching
(Yeah...Yeah...Yeah)
There‚Äôs a Strange...

From the root to the fruit
That‚Äôs where everything started at
This is God‚Äôs Act, we just act possessed

14632,On Your Own,Y.V.E. 48,"[Verse 1]
I thought you could die by loneliness
But my heart is gone, love lost
And I'm feeling blessed

Empty car on a full road
No map, don't know how to get home
Navigate yourself by starlight
Once again I spend a lonely night
Looking up at the sky, dream big but realize
It's really all only in your mind
Every time you're loving blind
So don't be getting confused
You're on your own till love is a loose
Don't last for long, smile kids
Just dyes a face, lost bliss
Before you know, you're on your own again
Looking at pictures all alone again
Past memories float away
[?] in the river not here to say
Shouted past dream and making you pay
Been on the same road for so many days
Blinded by the headlight
It's time to get your head right

[Chorus]
It's time to get your head right
(Get your head right, get your head right)

[Verse 2]
I'm tired all the time
But you know I could never sleep
Lay awake the whole damn night
Memories stuck on repeat
Looking out the window
Thinking about the times I didn't show
Should've cried and let me know
If I ever thought I was letting you go

I rather you tear me apart
And smile and say you need a new start
Sleepless nights with nowhere to go
So much effort when nothing to show
Tell me why I laugh, why I cry
If the next day you don't know why
Why I laugh, why I smile
If the next day your lover's going by

See for me sometimes lately
Think I'm best on my own maybe
Double bed, one pillow no lately
Knows my heart, can feel that you hate me
Please forgive me for all my ignorance
Love lost, I left it in past tense
(In past tense, in past tense)

[Chorus]
It's time to get your head right
(Get your head right, get your head right)

But that's just the general information - here's some other specific things you can look forward to in your workout!

[sung]
You're gonna run a ramp with two buckets of water
Swing off a rope for some reason
At some point you'll drop to your knees when it's raining
And look up into the sky-yai!

You'll sit on a post with your arms out
Hey - these flowers are way out of season!
You'll fly to a swamp planet, meet a little green man
And move big heavy things with your mind!

But I know a way we can make you a warrior
Even though now you're a wuss
It's the way of the platypus

Sat in the backseat
Said you won't leave me
Called me your treasure
Keep me forever

I would walk the other way
Sayin' it ain't about you, yea

But I was only foolish
I made more mistakes
Than I could count
I needed time to
Learn how to love you
But now I do
'Cause I'm older now

Lay on your sofa
Remind me to hold ya
But I just inhale
Put it out in the ashtray
And I'll be on my way

Sayin' it ain't about you, yea

But we can hit the mall sometimes, throw me them digits
So we can floss a little, ride with me in my Bentley
Coorodinatin' clothes, True Religion, True Religion then
Hit up the Hamptons and spend a day in Venice
But we could do this all just as soon as I finish
I know you don't like this but girl, this is the business
As soon as I get some time, then we can start chillin', but
Right now the boy is on a mission for a million, so

Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?

I could build a spaceship for you
But it wouldn't get us anywhere tonight
And you can start a revolution
But we both know it will never end
It won't end this stupid fight

I just wanna laugh with you
Burn our ships and start a new
Don't you wanna try?

I could build a spaceship for you
If you really feel you need to fly away
You would have a hell of a view
Never ever see a cloudy day
But I'm asking you to stay

[Chorus]
I just wanna laugh with you
Burn our ships and start a new
Maybe if we try

[Verse 3]
I will build a spaceship for you
That will take you right up to the stars tonight
It will be a spaceship for two
If you're gonna make it to the moon
I'll be right back by your side
I just wanna laugh with you
Please don't get inside of you
Please gonna try

I could build a spaceship for you
And you can start a revolution

Biggie Smalls
Listen...

Uh yeah baby oooooooh, listen to me, oh yeaaaah

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit

The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or boy-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin ""Ay papi!""
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start

Bitches screamin they want That old thing back
Like B I Double G I E
Wit some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known to bustin in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love and hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to come the ghetto is crazy
How come you ain't, ?? semi your faces
When I come you be cryin like I'm killin ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin I got my swagger back
I'm lookin like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit...

Is my mind playin tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot
But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em
And if I'm caressin em, I'm undressin em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin fantasies without that nigga Mr. Walk
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit

14661,Safe and Sound,WUSA,"(If I only said lame shit about war I'd be OK)
Political Correctness has become a plague
Everyones feelings are hurt all the time
Stop trying to dictate what I do and say
If I'm so bad, go back to mom and dads

Safe and sound
(I'm sick of modern art in a hardcore scene)
I'm not intolerant
I just don't give a fuck!
Tell the message boards how much I suck
""you can't say that, it's too offensive
Even though you know I never meant it
The sensitive youths need a place to hide""
Well sorry dudes, you're not my kind
Complain because you're bored
And senseless offensive
(If you are a wuss.)

There's a place I go to
Where no one knows me
It's not lonely
It's a necessary thing
It's a place I made up
Find out what I'm made of
The nights I've stayed up
Counting stars and fighting sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it wash over me
Ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reveals life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

[Chorus]
Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day
It gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell each other secrets
And remember how to love

(There's a place I go to)
(Find out what I'm made of)

[Verse 2]
There's a place I'm going
No one knows me
If I breathe real slowly
Let it out and let it in
It can be terrifying
To be slowly dying
Also clarifying
The end where we begin

So let it wash over me
I'm ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reveals life's mystery
Steady on down the line

And find how far
To go

Seguramente habr√° un sitio que pueda ponernos al tanto
Dejando atr√°s la forma en que esto un d√≠a termin√≥

[Verso 2: Mon Laferte & El David Aguilar]
Si alguna vez nos volvemos a ver abracemos la suerte
Y si nos toca esa luna menguante nos damos el chance
De contemplarla como aquella vez en la banca de un parque
Para que no quepa duda de que fue un hermoso amor

Tanta cosa buena que viv√≠ te quiero agradecer
Porque hasta en la pena en que me vi la puedo comprender
Si nosotros alg√∫n d√≠a, cuanto no recordar√≠a, todo lo que te dir√≠a

Si alguna vez nos volvemos a ver nos re√≠mos de todo
Y sin contarnos la historia de c√≥mo salimos del hoyo

No looking back to whatever I left behind

Under the burning sun and the blinding light
I didn‚Äôt wave goodbye, I didn‚Äôt even wave goodbye

I slipped out and didn‚Äôt even close the door
Nothing left to close the door for

Me encanta tu boca que dice que sabe
Entiende y perdona los sabios y giles
Que han comido tanto que han agotado su voluntad de querer

Me gusta que uses la palabra amigo
Cuando quiero estar un rato contigo
No hay ning√∫n secreto que guarde conmigo sin preguntar

Me encanta sentir as√≠ tu respiro
Abri√©ndose paso al invierno tan fr√≠o
En un mundo gigante, cambiante y jodido es bueno sentirse as√≠

Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti pa¬¥ siempre
Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti

Me gustan tus ojos azules
Tu mente que acepta las desilusiones
El tiempo que pasa nos va dejando libres para estar mejor

Me encanta la fuerza que tu cuerpo tiene
Para conseguir lo que tuvo y que quiere
Mujer consecuente ahora y siempre hasta la final

Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti pa¬¥ siempre
Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti

Yo s√© que no hay nada tan importante como verte otra vez
Solo s√© que mi mano y boca te aprietan muy fuerte
Que de vez en cuando nos pegamos de frente
No hay nada m√°s que pensar y mirar de cerca y sentir

Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti pa¬¥ siempre
Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti

Me gustan tus ojos azules
Me encanta tu pelo que es como una nube
Que ha llovido tanto que no tiene nada m√°s que ocultar

Me encanta la fuerza que tu cuerpo tiene
Para conseguir lo que tuvo y que quiere
Mujer consecuente ahora y siempre hasta la final

Camino solo a mi destino
Pretendo no buscar cari√±o
Pero tu llegas de repente
Con tus aires inocentes
Y‚ÄÖme‚ÄÖantojas de so√±ar

[Verso 2]
Me‚ÄÖdices qu√©date conmigo
Vamos a amanecer los‚ÄÖdos juntitos
Y luego me hablas de tus planes
De tus miedos incesantes
Y me empiezo a enamorar

Ay me dej√© enredar por ti
Como un idiota
Sub√≠ hasta el cielo y me ca√≠
Ay que dolor
Ya lo que pas√≥ entre los dos
Se fug√≥ en la historia
Porque as√≠ mismo
Como llegaste
Te me fuiste

Porqu√© te me fuiste guapita? (Cesar)
Y Por qu√© me dejaste cuando mas te quer√≠a? (Lunale)

Que voy a hacer estoy perdida
Y yo que estaba tan tranquila
Pero llegaste a ilusionarme
Descarado a engatusarme
Y te vas as√≠ nomas

Ay me dej√© enredar por ti
Como un idiota
Sub√≠ hasta el cielo y me ca√≠
Ay que dolor
Ya lo que pas√≥ entre los dos

It all girl, came through the storm again
Find your joy, let go of the past
Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free

Things got deep, you'd drown with me
If there was heat, I know you'd cock back
Click, clap, spit a round with me
Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me
To all them haters, they can come get and me
It's us against the world, 150 I love Miami

La bandera de paz bajo las s√°banas blancas
Cuando las bocas callan

Las maratones de amor sin descanso
Seguir la huella que va dejando tu tacto
La payasa la loca la amiga

Que siempre combinan con las m√≠as
Escalar tu cuerpo boca abajo
Anclarme contigo en el espacio
Los sue√±os que vienen a visitarnos
Descubrir que el mundo a tu lado se hace un poquito menos raro

Feels like we're on the edge right now

I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it¬¥, my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down

I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, let you down

Still loves us the wing, from my little room
Cause I gotta go back soon

Other people's lives, all the long goodbyes
Watching in the mirror with longing in my eyes

To treat me like you do
When you've your hands upon me
And told me who you are

I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now how do I feel

Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more

And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today

And I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard you speak
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now, how should I feel

I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold
When your heart grows cold
When your heart grows cold

On days of doubt
I would listen to you as a friend
Hope let you down
We'll take the future in our hands and walk it again

I'll be your raincoat, on high tide your sailboat
When the water falls from your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
And when the night comes, I'll be your light house
Save you from waterfalls in your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
Eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes

14781,Super Far,LANY,"[Verse 1]
Up all night on my mind got me thinking
Wanna stay, can you give me a reason?
I don't think so, I don't think so
I'm in love with someone, but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't be mean, if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

[Verse 2]
Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work, know it hurts, but I'll go there
Do the same, can you show me that you care?
God, I hope so, but I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't be mean, if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested, I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

When you're gone or when you're first born
Could you carry me?
Could you carry me?

How we got so far, you and me
Almost like there's oceans between us, us
So I need to know

Remember when we would dance all night
Parking lots and velvet skies
I was there for you
And you were there for me

Every time we would start a fight
We'd make love till the morning light
I was there for you
And you were there for me

So I don't know how we
How we got so far, you and me
Almost like there's oceans between us, us
So I need to know

14779,American Teen,Khalid,"[Verse 1]
Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Verse 2]
Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

[Pre-Chorus]
From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen (American teen)
American teen
Mmm, oh yeah
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American

So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American (American dream)
And we don't always say what we mean
It's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen

I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't play, letting my life get away

I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower

Histoire improbable d'une fantaisie
Proche de l'√©quateur √† un point pr√©cis
Latitude 5.100, longitude 36
Au c≈ìur de la for√™t √† cet interstice
Dans ta tenue d'√àve verdoyante
Tu √©tais d'une beaut√© √©tourdissante
Des oiseaux nous chantaient leur m√©lop√©e
Et nous vivions heureux dans la canop√©e

Jungle sauvage ouvre tes bras
Il en faut peu pour toi et moi
Prenons racine dans les bois
Enfants na√Øfs ou hors-la-loi
Les pieds plant√©s dans un ruisseau

Il nous invite un peu plus haut

Histoire m√©morable d'une r√™verie
Que nous vivions ensemble en Amazonie
Un retour aux sources, vie sans artifices
√Ä deux dans la for√™t loin des mal√©fices
Dans la torpeur moite et luxuriante
D'une jungle aux lianes exub√©rantes
Les arbres mill√©naires nous ont adopt√©s
Et nous vivions heureux dans la canop√©e

14788,Put It On For Me,Don Diablo,"[Verse 1]
City lights, red and gold
Pretty girls on their phones
Other life we live alone
High heels run like dominoes
On SoHo streets to midnight shows
Tryna hide from what we know

[Pre-Chorus]
He's got one shot to turn it around
I need blood rush, so don't let me down

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you put it on for me?
I've been working all myself all week
Baby, won't you play the song, drop the bomb
Won't you put it on for me?
I'm gonna be dancing like a freak
I don't care if everybody sees
Baby, won't you play the song, drop the bomb
Won't you put it on for me?

[Post-Chorus]
I've been working
I've been working
Baby, won't you put it on for me?

Living for the rhythm of it
Moving in the middle of it
There ain't inambitions in this
Oh-oh, I let go of my body
I can't dance, but I don't care
And now I'm going for the last orders
Two, three, four

14754,No S√© Decirte No,Marco Mares,"Letra de No s√© decirte no

[Verso 1]
Qui√©reme otro ratito
Hoy tu mirada me lo grita
Que nuestros cuerpos se derritan
Quiero que se nos pase el d√≠a coraz√≥n
Juntitos
D√≠melo suavecito
Que si en ingl√©s ""I love you mucho""
O en portugu√™s ‚Äúte quero muito‚Äú
Que los idiomas sobran si somos t√∫ y yo
No hay reglas

[Coro]
Te quiero sin puntos ni may√∫sculas
Te veo y no cambio nada en ti, en ti
Te quiero, sin peros ni gram√°tica
Y quiero cien a√±os m√°s de ti
No s√© decirte no

[Verso 2]
H√°blame a besitos
Que sean muy largos, que no hay prisa
Son como aviones y una visa
Toma tu tiempo y disfr√∫talo
Vamos, juguemos
A veces no a besos yo prefiero
Si t√∫ me lo pides yo no me muevo
Que cinco minutos se hagan eternos
Quiero y aunque no debo
Renuncio al mundo y a sus relojes
Paguemos las deudas con muchas flores
Quiero, que aunque sea un juego
Te lo imagines junto a m√≠

[Coro]
Te quiero sin puntos ni may√∫sculas
Te veo y no cambio nada en ti, en ti
Te quiero sin puntos ni may√∫sculas
Te veo y no cambio nada en ti, en ti
Te quiero, sin peros ni gram√°tica
Y quiero cien a√±os m√°s de ti
No s√© decirte no

[Verse 1]
Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, what's going on?
But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hideaway with me some more
Mash it

Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh

[Verse 2]
You send me the shiver and the spine, might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge, I'm letting go
Oh-oh, you're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Pulling my head into the clouds, I'm floating off
When you can be going, I can't find a way to stop
Oh-oh, you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

[Chorus]
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure (Ooh, aah)

14793,These Days,Rudimental,"[Intro: Macklemore]
I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

[Verse 1: Dan Caplen]
Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

[Post-Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days

[Verse 2: Dan Caplen & Jess Glynne]
Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk, remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
To these days, these days, oh

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you‚Äôd end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

[Outro: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

14798,Anywhere,Rita Ora,"[Verse 1]
Time flies by when the night is young
Daylight shines on an undisclosed location, location
Bloodshot eyes looking for the sun
Paradise, we lived it and we called it a vacation, vacation

[Pre-Chorus]
You're painting me a dream that I
Wanna belong in, wanna belong in

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
A million miles from L.A.
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away
Someplace where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Just take me anywhere (Anywhere), take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you

[Post-Chorus]
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me
Oh, fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
Truth comes out when we're blacking out
Looking for connection in a crowd of empty faces, empty faces
Your secrets are the only thing I'm craving now
The good and the bad, let me in
'Cause I could take it, I could take it

[Pre-Chorus]
You're painting me a dream that I
Wanna belong in (Wanna belong in), wanna belong in

Making smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it

On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space

Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever (Yeah)

Takin' long walks how my time spent
Just a kid with that Empire State of mindset
Kickflippin' off a Blind deck
Dippin' from the New York City's finest
Yeah, said l've been up on my New York shit
Walkin' down the block with my New York bitch
I could never leave my city, ain't nothin' like it
Even if I do though, I could never hide it
Top down on the West side when I'm drivin'
East side be the only side that I'm ridin' (Woah)

As a kid, they told me love was made up
But I used to tell em they were wrong
Cause the blue-eyed girl who made me wake up
Will stay right by me in this song
I stood there counting every heartbeat
Thinking about the words to say
Tried not to understand that feeling
But would it ever go away?

[Chorus]
Now those were the days
Before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself
Out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
Will you come dancing next to me?
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me

You told me we would be forever
But maybe we were just too young
I wonder if you still remember
When we were dancing in the sun

Now those were the days
Before you had to go away

Out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold

Glass full 'cause she thirsty
She said, ""don't drink till it's Thursday""
But she'll come out on a workday
When all work and no play could just make Jane go crazy
And it's no fun to worry, goin' home, leaving early
Then she run it up, back it up, when she know you feelin' the work
Turn it up, just a touch, givin' love so good that it hurts
Till she fuck it up, leanin up, even though she still on the up
Leave you shook, turn and looks, make you never want to leave

No, she don't need no one, because the song's still on

When the sunlight sets
We won't go to bed
Til' the night is ours
Take you far away
To a foreign place
If you want, I'll go

Slow it down, watch my step
We will drown, soakin' wet
Not a doubt in our head (We don't need the soul)
Our light inside will be alright
Just take me by the hand

Flying high
Over the world with you
I'll come along
Whereever you want me to
Can't get enough
We're rich in the skies too
All through the night
As long as I'm here with you

Colors fillin' in the lines
Breaking plates to wake my neighbors
Cashing in on all my favors

Take it two by two til we rock the bus

We've been working so hard and we need the rush
Get out of this town like an exodus
Get out of this town like an exodus
Get out of this town like an exodus

Crashing waves and breaking bones

Draw something that can't be found
And learn to walk again somehow

And tears me from a place I know
It helps me to surprise myself
You know you can surprise yourself
So let go and surprise yourself

Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

[Verse 2: Sarah Aarons]
Come on, I know it's way too soon
But I waited for you, I think that's long enough
So long to all those lonely nights, battles and picking fights
It's already been done
I, can't believe my eyes
How on earth did I find myself so far in love?
We could be the perfect match
And what's so wrong with that? Mm

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
Oh, baby, come on and say it now
Just let the words come out
(Tell me you love me)
It's easy, just say what's on your mind
Say it a million times
(Tell me you love me)
Oh, baby, come on and say it now
Just let the words come out
(Tell me you love me)
It's easy, just say what's on your mind
Say it a million times
(Tell me you love me)

[Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

"
14837,Grow Up,Olly Murs,"[Verse 1]
I thought about you the other day
What the hell happened with you and me?
Cause, oh, ain't no lovin' no more
You ain't as cool as you used to be
Closer to the mirror than you are to me
I said, oh, had to show you that door

[Pre-Chorus]
Someday I hope we can fix it, 'cause I ain't too proud to try
Say hi to your friends, and if they ever ask you why
We don't talk...

[Chorus]
Know you gotta grow up
Ain't you sick of being immature?
Talkin' loud 'cause you're insecure
You always turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, c'mon
Why you always gotta show off?
You're so vain, I already know
That when you hear this on the radio
You're gonna turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause it's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Now you said some stuff that you can't take back
How did you think that I would react?
Cause you, you must be out of your mind, no
How did we go straight from love to hate?
Now it's so deep that we can't be mates
I said, oh, we should give it some time

[Pre-Chorus]
Someday I hope we can fix it, 'cause I ain't too proud to try
Say hi to your friends, and if they ever ask you why

Talkin' loud 'cause you're insecure

You're gonna turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Se caen por las escaleras

Y unas gotas de lluvia que guardo en esta maleta
Ruedan por el colch√≥n de mi cama ya desierta

This is what we always aimed for

No me arrepiento
Lo que vivimos
Fue tan sincero
Cu√°nto te quise
Cu√°nto te quiero
Cu√°nto te quiero
Cu√°nto te quiero

14892,La Vida Entera,Camila,"Era una furia
Un rel√°mpago
Una enfermedad sin cura
Un adicto a esa adrenalina oscura
Una rosa negra con espinas

Un espejismo
Un reflejo
Un mal sue√±o
Lo peor de mi mismo
El mejor exponente del ego√≠smo
Una maquina de hacer heridas

Hasta que llegaste y me encendiste con tu luz
Tu mirada poderosa y alma curandera
Tu sonrisa eterna y cuerpo de pantera

Era mi mente
Quien me hac√≠a caer precipitadamente
Yo culpaba al destino
De mi mala suerte
En exceso era de vac√≠o

Hasta que llegaste y me encendiste con tu luz
Tu mirada poderosa y alma curandera
Tu sonrisa eterna y cuerpo de pantera

Me cambio la vida entera
Me cambio la vida entera
Me cambio la vida entera

14880,La fuerza del coraz√≥n,Alejandro Sanz,"[Verse 1]
M√≠rame, en nada me consigo concentrar
Ando despistado, todo lo hago mal
Soy un desastre y no s√© qu√© est√° pasando
Me gustas a rabiar, te deseo
Me llegas a desesperar
Es tan grande lo que siento por ti
Que tenerte no bastar√°
Qu√© es esto que me invita a vivir?
Qu√© me da la ilusi√≥n?
Qu√© ser√° esa fuerza que a todos
Nos une de dos en dos?
Ser√° la fuerza del coraz√≥n?

[Verse 2]
Hace que te abrace
Y los cuerpos lleguen a estorbar
Tiemblo s√≥lo con la idea de rozar
Tus labios llenos de besos nuevos
No puedo dormir, robas mi tranquilidad
Alguien ha bordado tu cuerpo
Con hilos de mi ansiedad
De cintur√≥n tus piernas cruzadas
De mi espalda un reloj
Donde tus dedos son las agujas
Que dan cuerda a este motor
Que es la fuerza del coraz√≥n, no no

[Chorus]
Y es la fuerza que te lleva
Que te empuja y que te llena
Que te arrastra y que te acerca a Dios
Es un sentimiento, casi una obsesi√≥n
Si la fuerza es del coraz√≥n
Es algo que te l√≠a
La descarga de energ√≠a
Que te va quitando la raz√≥n
Te hace tropezar, te crea confusi√≥n
Seguro que es la fuerza del coraz√≥n
Es la fuerza que te lleva, no no, no

[Verse 3]
No puedo pensar, tendr√≠a que cuidarme m√°s
Poco a poco pierdo la vida
Y luego me la das
Qu√© es lo que va cegando al amante
Que va por ah√≠ de se√±or?
Y no es m√°s que un chiquillo travieso, provocador
Ser√° la fuerza del coraz√≥n? No no no

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Que te empuja y que te llena
Que te arrastra y que te acerca a Dios
Es un sentimiento, casi una obsesi√≥n
Si la fuerza es del coraz√≥n
Es algo que te l√≠a
La descarga de energ√≠a
Que te va quitando la raz√≥n
Te hace tropezar, te crea confusi√≥n
Seguro que es la fuerza del coraz√≥n

¬øPor qu√© no te abrac√© la vida cuando la ten√≠a?
Y yo que no me daba cuenta cu√°nto te dol√≠a

C√≥mo es que nunca me fij√© que ya no sonre√≠as
Y que antes de apagar la luz ya nada me dec√≠as
Que a ti el amor se te escap√≥, que hab√≠a llegado el d√≠a
Que ya no me sent√≠as, que ya ni te dol√≠a

Me dediqu√© a no verte
Y me encerr√© en mi mundo y no pudiste detenerme
Y me alej√© mil veces, y cuando regres√© te hab√≠a perdido para siempre
Y quise detenerte
Y entonces descubr√≠ que ya mirabas diferente
Me dediqu√© a perderte, me dediqu√© a perderte

[Verso 3]
¬øPor qu√© no te llen√© de m√≠ cuando a√∫n hab√≠a tiempo?
¬øPor qu√© no pude comprender lo que a esta hora entiendo?
Que fuiste todo para m√≠ y que yo estaba ciego
Te dej√© para luego, este maldito ego

Sin voltear, sin voltear

Y perd√≠ su rastro

Que s√≥lo junto a ella puedo respirar
No hay brillo en las estrellas
Ya ni el sol me calienta
Y estoy muy solo aqu√≠
No s√© a donde fue
Por favor d√≠gale usted

Fueron tantos los momentos que la am√©
Que siento sus caricias y su olor est√° en mi piel
Cada noche la abrazaba junto a mi
La cubr√≠a de besos
Y entre mil caricias
La llevaba a la locura

[Verso 1]
Cuando estabas junto a m√≠
Nuestra luz era celestial
¬øQu√© m√°s pod√≠a pedir?
Encontr√© la felicidad

[Pre-Coro]
Sin aviso nuestro para√≠so nos dej√≥
Y ahora tu recuerdo me hace sombra al coraz√≥n

[Coro]
Hoy se cumple un mes que ya no me ves
Te fuiste nada m√°s
Quisiste renunciar a quererme
Y c√≥mo dueles
Mientras pienso en ti y en lo que perd√≠
Quisiera evitar haberme permitido amarte
Para perderte
Y me dueles, c√≥mo dueles

Los golpes en la piel
Dejan marca y despu√©s se van
Se van, se van, se van
Pero me rompiste en dos
Y no encuentro reparaci√≥n

14850,It's Gotta Be You,Isaiah,"[Verse 1]
I hear a million voices in my head
Telling me the things I should have said
I don't know why I let you go
Oh I learned the hard way
Tell me it's not too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Now my arms are open wide
They're hanging forever, there
Waiting forever, for you
I won't give up on you this time
Cause I ain't holding up, for nobody else

[Chorus]
It's gotta be you
When you walked away my
Heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I could never find it
I don't want to fight it
It's gotta be you

[Verse 2]
I wish I could turn back the time
The power is yours and never mine
Maybe with time you'll see that
I can give you all the things you missed
Oh no no

[Pre-Chorus]
Now my arms are open wide
And I ain't holding now, for nobody else

[Chorus]
It's gotta be you
When you walked away
My heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I could never find it
I don't want to fight it
It's gotta be you

You don't have to answer right now
Baby go and take your time
Cause I'll be here
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you

It's gotta be you
When you walked away my
Heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I can never find it
I don't want to fight it
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
I don't want nobody else
Nobody else but you
You, oh woah
It's gotta be you

Dar√≠a lo que fuera por volverte a ver

Por eso en la trinchera de mi soledad
Tus ojos son mi luz y tu esplendor mi coraz√≥n

What if we could start again?
Would I still be your only man?
Would we try to hide the love that's inside
Keep running till our hearts won't collide
Be sure that we don't
Fall in love again

[Chorus]
And you know that it's too late, now
To find somebody better than me
It's for a reason, and somehow
There's some place I would rather be
And I don't need your pity, babe
And moved to another city, babe
Cause I know one thing, for sure
I don't love you anymore

I don't love you anymore

[Verse]
The final straw, final drive
Kept it all together, trying to survive
We're traveling for ages, but we won't arrive
We're running out of gas, now we need to refill
We need to decide, I'm driving alone
Now keep on walking babe, I'll find you at home
And don't come back, it's the amazon
Let me give it to you straight

And you know that it's too late, now
To find somebody better than me
It's for a reason and somehow

Tengo una flor de bolsillo
Marchita de buscar a una mujer que me quiera
Y reciba su perfume hasta traer la primavera
Y me ense√±e lo que no aprend√≠ de la vida

Porque estoy tan s√≥lo a un paso de ganarme la alegr√≠a
Porque el coraz√≥n levanta una tormenta enfurecida
Desde aquel momento en que te vi

No podras
Talvez te olvides de mi
Talvez me olvide de ti wow oh!
Pero esta vez aprendi
Que no se debe mentir, no.!
De una promesa vivi
Hoy ya no puedo seguir
Creyendo... En ti...
Cada momentoooo!
Voy tropezando en desamor..
Y es que no queda
Nada entre tu y yo
Si estoy llorandooo!
No es que te extrae el corazon
Es que a tu lado
Aprendi el dolor
No podras olvidar
Que te ame
Como yo nunca imagine
Estare en tu piel
Cada momento en donde estes
Siempre habra un lugar
Algun recuerdo que sera
Un eterno suspirar....
Si estoy llorando
No es que te extrae el corazon
Es que a tu lado
Aprendi el dolor
No podras olvidar
Que te ame
Como yo nunca imagine
Estare en tu piel
Cada momento en donde estes
Siempre habra un lugar
Algun recuerdo que sera

No podras, olvidar! Que te Ameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.!!!!!

14867,Fuiste T√∫,Ricardo Arjona,"[Letra de ""Fuiste T√∫""]

[Intro Instrumental]

[Verso 1: Gaby Moreno]
Fuiste t√∫
Tenerte fue una foto tuya puesta en mi cartera
Un beso y verte hacer peque√±o por la carretera
Lo tuyo fue la intermitencia y la melancol√≠a
Lo m√≠o fue aceptarlo todo porque te quer√≠a
Verte llegar fue luz, verte partir un blues

[Verso 2: Ricardo Arjona]
Fuiste t√∫
De m√°s est√° decir que sobra decir tantas cosas
O aprendes a querer la espina o no aceptes rosas
Jam√°s te dije una mentira o te invent√© un chantaje
Las nubes grises tambi√©n forman parte del paisaje

[Pre-Coro: Ricardo Arjona]
Y no me veas as√≠
Si hubo un culpable aqu√≠
Fuiste t√∫

[Coro: Ricardo Arjona & Gaby Moreno]
Qu√© f√°cil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez
Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque
Que encendi√≥ la luz que hoy se desaparece
As√≠ se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia
Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas
Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte

[Post-Coro: Ricardo Arjona & Gaby Moreno, Ricardo Arjona]
Nada m√°s que decir
Solo queda insistir
Dilo

[Verso 3: Gaby Moreno, Ricardo Arjona]
Fuiste t√∫
La luz de ne√≥n del barrio sabe que estoy tan cansada
Me ha visto caminar descalza por la madrugada
Estoy en medio del que soy y del que t√∫ quisieras (Uh)
Queriendo despertar pensando como no quisiera (Uh)

[Pre-Coro: Ricardo Arjona, Gaby Moreno & Ambos]
Y no me veas as√≠ (Uh)
Si hubo un culpable aqu√≠
Fuiste t√∫

Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas

14852,Run For Your Life,Mako,"[Verse 1]
You bought yourself a little freedom
Yeah I know you saved up, yeah you saved up
So make it last
You got some brand new sneakers
Little darling lace up, darling lace up
And make it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They'll try to make you talk
Don't give them nothing
You're up against the wall
Waiting for judgement
Open your prison door
Nobody's watching

[Chorus]
You only get one shot
You better run for your life
You better run for your life

[Verse 2]
Is it everything you dream of?
Now that you've got your eyes up, got your eyes up
Off the ground
You hear me calling out your treason
Little rebel rise up, go and rise up
And make us proud

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They'll feed you sense and doubt
Play on your conscience
But you'd rather risk it all
Fighting for justice
Here's what you waited for
Everyone's watching

[Chorus]
You only get one shot
You better run for your life
You better run for your life

[Pre-Chorus]
They'll try to make you talk
Don't give them nothing
You're up against the wall
Waiting for judgement
Open your prison
Nobody's watching

You better run for your life

You better run for your life
You better run for your life
You better run for your life

14882,Amores extra√±os,Laura Pausini,"Letra de ""Amores extra√±os""
Ya sab√≠¬≠a que no llegar√≠¬≠a
Ya sab√≠¬≠a que era una mentira
Cuanto tiempo que por √©l perd√≠¬≠
Que promesa rota sin cumplir
Son amores problem√°ticos
Como t√∫, como yo
Es la espera en un tel√©fono
La aventura de lo il√≥gico
La locura de lo m√°gico
Un veneno sin ant√≠¬≠doto
La amargura de lo ef√≠¬≠mero
Porque √©l se march√≥
Amores, tan extra√±os que te hacen c√≠¬≠nica
Te hacen sonre√≠¬≠r entre l√°grimas
Cu√°ntas p√°ginas hipot√©ticas, para no escribir las
Aut√©nticas
Son amores que s√≥lo a nuestra edad
Se confunden en nuestros esp√≠¬≠ritus
Te interrogan y nunca te dejan ver
Si ser√°n amor o placer
Y cuantas noches llorar√© por √©l
Cuantas veces volver√© a leer
Aquellas cartas que yo recib√≠¬≠a
Cuando mis penas eran alegr√≠¬≠as
Son amores espor√°dicos
Pero en ti quedar√°n
Amores, tan extra√±os que vienen y se van
Que en tu coraz√≥n sobrevivir√°n
Son historias que siempre contar√°s
Sin saber si son de verdad
Son amores fr√°giles
Prisioneros, c√≥mplices
Son amores problem√°ticos
Como t√∫, como yo
Son amores fr√°giles
Prisioneros, c√≥mplices
Tan extra√±os que viven neg√°ndose
Escondi√©ndose de los dos
Son amores que s√≥lo a nuestra edad
Se confunden en nuestro esp√≠¬≠ritu
Son amores problem√°ticos
Que se esconder√°n de los dos
Son amores que vienen y se van
Son historias que siempre contar√°s
Ya sab√≠¬≠a que no llegar√≠¬≠a
Esta vez me lo prometer√©
Tengo ganas de un amor sincero, ya sin √©l

Y el hotel, ¬øera verdad que es tan rom√°ntico y lujoso

14908,Pasos de cero,Pablo Albor√°n,"Entre tu boca y la m√≠a
Hay un cuento de hadas que siempre acaba bien
Entre las s√°banas fr√≠as
Me pierdo a solas pensando en tu piel

Que curiosa la vida
Que de pronto sorprende con este loco amor
Y es que todo se acaba
Y termina si dejo de ser lo que soy

B√©same no dudes ni un segundo de mi alma
Alteras mis sentidos, liberas mis alas
No cabe tanto amor en esta cama
Si me dejaras...

Qu√© bueno es sentir que suspiro de nuevo
Que tu roce y mi roce juntos forman fuego
Delicada llama que nunca se apaga

Sin ti yo me pierdo
Sin ti me vuelvo veneno
No entiendo el despertar sin un beso de esos
Sin tu aliento en mi cuello (x2)

Qu√© futuro m√°s bello
Qu√© plan m√°s perfecto presiento
No tendremos que estar batallando
Buscando siempre el momento

Por dar pasos de cero y un camino certero de sue√±os
Liberamos el llanto vac√≠o que tanto provocan los miedos

B√©same no dudes ni un segundo de mi alma
Alteras mis sentidos, liberas mis alas
No cabe tanto amor en esta cama, si me dejaras...

Qu√© bueno es sentir que suspiro de nuevo

Delicada llama que nunca se apaga

Sin ti me vuelvo veneno
No entiendo el despertar sin un beso de esos
Sin tu aliento en mi cuello (x2)

14922,Amor,Cristian Castro,"D√≥nde est√° el amor?
Alguien lo ha encontrado por favor o no?
D√≥nde puede ir?
Puede estar herido, pero no morir
Puede estar cansado
Puede estar encadenado

A la sombra de un olvido

Amor, amor
Que te pintas de cualquier color
Tan profundo como el viento
Tan lejano como el tiempo
Y tan cierto como el sol

Si me escuchas si me puedes ver
No me cierres tu guarida
Llena un poco de mi vida
Llena un poco de mi ser

D√≥nde puede estar
El amor que un d√≠a se llebo la mar
Cuando volver√°?
Puede que no vuelva nunca m√°s, quiz√°s
Puede estar herido
Puede estar desfallecido
Quiz√°s est√© sentado
A la puerta del pasado

Cuando todos los amigos se han largado

Sintiendo morbo por primera vez
Y por primera vez tocandonos

Entre las sombras de los arboles
Nos desvestimos para amarnos bien
Para amarnos bien(4)

Matados de tanta risa
Con la luna resbalando por la espalda
Tu te pones mi camisa yo tu falda
Felices

Para callar los demonios que

Thal√≠a
Maluma

[Pre-Chorus: Thal√≠a & Maluma]
Desde esa noche te extra√±o en mi habitaci√≥n
Creo que puedo caer en una adicci√≥n contigo
No me esperaba jam√°s una historia as√≠
Siento mil cosas por ti, siento mil cosas

[Chorus: Thal√≠a & Maluma]
Entiende que desde esa noche, solamente pienso en ti
Desde esa noche, muero por tenerte aqu√≠
¬øQue es lo que te pasa que no quieres, amor?
Entiende que desde esa noche, solamente pienso en ti
Desde esa noche, muero por tenerte aqu√≠
Pero me da miedo enamorarme, de ti

[Post-Chorus: Thal√≠a, Maluma & Ambos]
Y yo de ti, y yo de ti
T√∫ no de m√≠, t√∫ no de m√≠
Y yo de ti
Pero me da miedo enamorarme, de ti
Y yo de ti, y yo de ti
T√∫ no de m√≠, t√∫ no de m√≠
Y yo de ti
Pero me da miedo enamorarme, amor

[Verse 2: Thal√≠a & Maluma]
Quiero llenarte de mil cosas y rosas de mil colores
Quiero darte las canciones, que s√≥lo te hablen de amores
Y que pienses en m√≠, quiero que seas feliz
Ya sufr√≠ lo que deb√≠a sufrir, casi no logro creer en m√≠
Tom√©moslo lento, aunque no sea lo que siento

Entonces dices que me quieres, me dices que me adoras
Que entre todos los hombres soy yo quien la enamora
Baby, por que no te decides a entregarme
Tu corazoncito voy a cuidarte

[Verse 3: Thal√≠a & Maluma]
Quiero llenarte de mil cosas y rosas de mil colores
Quiero darte las canciones, que s√≥lo te hablen de amores

Y esta canci√≥n quiero que la canten conmigo
Es el √©xito de mi carrera, es m√°s‚ÄÖimportante

[Verso 1]
Amanecer‚ÄÖcon √©l
A mi‚ÄÖcostado no es igual que estar‚ÄÖcontigo
No es que est√© mal, ni hablar
Pero le falta madurar, es casi un ni√±o

[Verso 2]
Blanco como el yogur
Sin ese toro que t√∫ llevas en el pecho
Fragilidad de flor
Nada que ver con mi perverso favorito

[Pre-Coro 1]
Sin tus u√±as ara√±√°ndome la espalda
Sin tus manos que me estrujan, todo cambia
Sin tu lengua envenenando mi garganta
Sin tus dientes que torturan y endulzan, yo no siento nada

[Coro]
Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no
No es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa
No destilan los poros del cuerpo
Ambros√≠a salpicada de te quieros
Hacer el amor con otro no, no, no
Es como no hacer nada, falta fuego en la mirada
Falta dar el ama en cada beso
Y sentir que puedes alcanzar el cielo

[Verso 3]
Quise olvidarte con √©l
Quise vengar todas tus infidelidades
Y me sali√≥ tan mal
Que hasta me cuesta respirar su mismo aire

[Pre-Coro 2]
Los mechones de tu pelo negro crespo
Tus caderas afiladas y escurridas
Esa barba que raspaba como lija
Y tu sonrisa retorcida son lo mejor que hay en mi vida

[Coro]
Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no
No es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa
No destilan los poros del cuerpo
Ambros√≠a salpicada de te quieros
Hacer el amor con otro no, no, no
Es como no hacer nada falta fuego en la mirada
Falta dar el ama en cada beso
Y sentir que puedes alcanzar el cielo

Quise olvidarte con √©l

Ay, ay ,ay, ay, ay c√≥mo me duele

T√∫, llegaste a mi vida para ense√±arme
T√∫, supiste encenderme y luego apagarme

Y, y, y con los ojos cerrados te segu√≠
Si yo busqu√© dolor, lo consegu√≠
No eres la persona que pens√©
Que cre√≠, que ped√≠

Mientes, me haces da√±o y luego te arrepientes
Ya no tiene caso que lo intentes
No me quedan ganas de sentir
Llegas cuando estoy a punto de olvidarte
Busca tu camino en otra parte
Mientras busco el tiempo que perd√≠
Y hoy estoy mejor sin ti

[Verso 2]
Voy, de nuevo recordando lo que soy
Sabiendo lo que das y lo que doy
En m√≠ no queda espacio para ti
Y, y, y, y, y el tiempo hizo lo suyo y comprend√≠
Las cosas no suceden porque s√≠
No eres la persona que pens√©

Y hoy estoy mejor sin ti
Y hoy estoy mejor sin ti
Llegas cuando estoy a punto de olvidarte
Busca tu camino en otra parte
Mientras busco el tiempo que perd√≠
Y hoy estoy mejor sin ti
Que hoy estoy mejor sin ti
Que hoy estoy mejor sin ti

14927,Bajo El Agua,Manuel Medrano,"Letra de ""Bajo el Agua""

Quiero volar contigo, muy alto en alg√∫n lugar
Quisiera estar contigo viendo las estrellas sobre el mar
Quiero encontrar otro camino ponerme mi vestido y salir a caminar contigo
Quiero decirle al mundo que no somos amigos, decirle a la tristeza
Que no se cruce en mi camino

Quiero volar contigo, muy alto en alg√∫n lugar
Quisiera estar contigo viendo las estrellas sobre el mar
Quiero encontrar otro camino ponerme mi vestido y salir a caminar contigo
Quiero decirle al mundo que no somos amigos, decirle a la tristeza
Que no se cruce en mi camino

Hoy porque voy
Contra la fuerza de un submarino
A conquistar a esa dama que tanto juega conmigo
Voy por el mundo solo y sin amigos
Voy dando tantas vueltas sin ning√∫n sentido
Pero tu ayer cambiaste mi destino
Me diste vida, mucha m√°s vida que el vino
Me diste fuerza en los d√≠as fr√≠os
Me diste ganas de extra√±arte sin ning√∫n motivo

Quiero encontrar otro camino ponerme mi vestido y salir a caminar contigo
Quiero decirle al mundo que no somos amigos, decirle a la tristeza
Que no se cruce en tu camino
Que no se cruce, no
Que no se cruce, no
Que no se cruce, no

14912,Desnuda,Ricardo Arjona,"[Letra de ""Desnuda""]

[Verso 1]
No es ninguna aberraci√≥n sexual
Pero me gusta verte andar en cueros
El comp√°s de tus pechos aventureros
V√≠ctimas de la gravedad
¬øSer√° porque no me gusta la tapicer√≠a?
Que creo que tu desnudez es tu mejor lencer√≠a
Por eso es que me gustas tal y como eres
Incluso ese par de libras de m√°s
Si te viese tu jefe desnuda y detr√°s
No dudar√≠a en promover tu cintura
Deja llenarme de tu desnudez
Para afrontar los disfraces de afuera
De una mejor manera

[Coro]
Desnuda que no habr√° dise√±o que te quede mejor
Que el de tu piel ajustada a tu figura
Desnuda que no hay un ingenuo que vista una flor
Ser√≠a como taparle la hermosura
Desnuda que la naturaleza no se equivoca
Y si te hubiese querido con ropa, con ropa hubieses nacido
Deja llenarme de tu desnudez
Para vestirme por dentro
Aunque sea un momento

[Verso 2]
Y ahora que por fin te tengo as√≠
Desnuda y precisamente enfrente
Desnuda tambi√©n un poquito la mente
Pon tus complejos juntos de tu ropa
Y si te sientes un poquito loca
Ponte loca completa
Que verte ser√° solo el inicio
Antes de perder el juicio

[Coro]
Desnuda que no habr√° dise√±o que te quede mejor
Que el de tu piel ajustada a tu figura
Desnuda que no hay un ingenuo que vista una flor
Ser√≠a como taparle la hermosura
Desnuda que la naturaleza no se equivoca
Y si te hubiese querido con ropa, con ropa hubieses nacido

Completamente unidos sin mirar atr√°s
Perdidamente am√°ndonos al viento
Sin nudos en la mente y con la cara al mar
La rueda del tim√≥n abrazaremos
Con rumbo a aquella estrella que te promete
Volando en un velero por la espuma
Flotando entre la brisa del azul cristal

Pero, ¬øa d√≥nde vas? ¬øMe est√°s escuchando?
¬øQu√© hay de tu orgullo? ¬øQu√© hab√≠amos quedado?

Hay mentiras en los labios
Hay mentiras en la piel, que dolor
Hay mentiras, hay amantes
Que por instantes de placer
Ponen su vida a temblar

[Shakira]
Hay mentiras compasivas
Hay mentiras por piedad
Que no quieren lastimar
Hay mentiras que nos hieren de verdad
Ay, ay, ay

Hay enga√±os que por a√±os
Ocultaron la verdad
Haciendo mucho da√±o
Ay, yo me voy a refugiar
A la tierra de tu amor (mi verdad)

T√∫ eres mi amor, mi alegr√≠a
La verdad de mi vida
Mi bebe que me salta a los brazos de prisa
T√∫ eres mi refugio y mi verdad

Oye, t√∫ eres mi amor, mi alegr√≠a

Mi bebe que me calma el alma con risas
T√∫ eres mi refugio y mi verdad

Hay mentira en la mirada
Hay mentiras en la piel, dibujadas
Hay mentiras, hay amantes
Que por instantes de placer
Ponen su vida a temblar

Hay doctrinas y oradores
Dictadores sin piedad
Que gobiernan sin verdad
Y hay mentiras en los diarios, en las redes
Y en el mar, ay, ay, ay

Hay enga√±os que por a√±os
Ocultaron la verdad
Hiriendo de dolor
Ay, yo me voy a refugiar
Al oasis de tu amor

T√∫ eres mi amor, mi alegr√≠a
La verdad de mi vida

T√∫ eres mi refugio y mi verdad

Oye, t√∫ eres mi amor, mi alegr√≠a

No s√© qu√© creer

T√∫ eres la luz que me gu√≠a
T√∫ eres la voz que me calma
T√∫ eres la lluvia de mi alma

Cada vez que se aparece frente a m√≠ tu anatom√≠a
Porque este amor ya no entiende de consejos, ni razones
Se alimenta de pretextos y le faltan pantalones

14946,Ley De Newton,Beatriz Luengo,"[Letra de ""Ley De Newton"" ft. Jes√∫s Navarro]

Preciosa, ahora que estamos los dos
Acompa√±ando al silencio
Que vino a este encuentro entre tu voz y mi voz

Quisiera no equivocar la ocasi√≥n
Busco palabras perfectas entre mi conciencia
Y lo que est√° en mi raz√≥n

Y cuanto m√°s y m√°s y m√°s intento romper el hielo
Miro tus ojos frente a m√≠ brillando como un caramelo
Y quiero dejar de ser, de estar y pido a dios que se pare el tiempo
Entonces suspiras, te toco, y muero

S√≥lo quiero mirarte y olvidar el pasado
Reducir el espacio entre tu piel y mis manos
No digas lo siento
No existe lamento
Lo quiero todo, todo para m√≠
Te confieso que quise y no pude olvidarme
De tu dulce sonrisa y tus peque√±os detalles
Llegado el momento
No existe lamento
Y quiero todo, todo para m√≠

Propongo una tregua entre t√∫ y yo
Dejemos atr√°s la batalla, colguemos las armas
Y bandera blanca pa' el coraz√≥n

Seguro [seguro] que no saldr√° bien la ecuaci√≥n
Porque el amor no es perfecto
Y es que lo perfecto no le agrada a la pasi√≥n

Y cuanto m√°s y m√°s y m√°s intento romper el hielo
Pierdo la gravedad y siento por segundos que me caigo al suelo
Y siento que es verdad y que la ley de newton no se equivoca [no se equivoca]
Porque suspiras, te toco y muero

S√≥lo quiero mirarte y olvidar el pasado
Reducir el espacio entre tu piel y mis manos
No digas lo siento
No existe lamento
Lo quiero todo, todo para m√≠
Te confieso que quise y no pude olvidarme
De tu dulce sonrisa y tus peque√±os detalles
Llegado el momento
No existe lamento
Y quiero todo, todo para m√≠

Todo, todo, todo
Todo, todo, todo

Lo quiero todo, todo para m√≠

Quiz√°s sea mi‚ÄÖculpa‚ÄÖy no haya‚ÄÖsido solo mala suerte
El no poder‚ÄÖtenerte, el no poder tenerte
Y aqu√≠ estoy desesperado
Por todos esos besos que nunca te he dado
Esperando mi turno para defenderme
Sentado en el banquillo de los acusados
Me quedan tantas lunas llenas hoy vac√≠as
Se√±oras y se√±ores; les doy mi jurado

Pero siempre me equivoco y llego tarde
Vestido de valiente cuando yo soy un cobarde
El dulce de tus besos me hace falta, me quema y me arde
Recuerdo cada cosa que perd√≠ esa tarde cuando me dejaste solo
Te tuve a mi lado y ahora estoy solo
Rompiendo por fuera y por dentro lloro
Si muero de amor s√© que en otra vida de ti vuelvo y me enamoro

Sin ver que te perd√≠a, me alej√© de ti
Yo estaba ciego, amor
Tan solo con volver a verte todo cambiar√≠a

Yo s√©‚ÄÖque vamos por los 20
Pero date‚ÄÖcuenta lo dif√≠cil que ha sido tenerte a lado m√≠o

Si te dije que: ""Yo tambi√©n te puedo herir""
No s√© si haces lo que haces por hacerte sentir
Si esa foto no dice la verdad de ti

El veneno dulce de tu encanto
O es la llama que me va quemando
Es la miel de tu ternura
La raz√≥n de mi locura

Sin la luz de tu mirada
Sin el eco de tu risa

Eres due√±o del calor
Sobre mi almohada
De mis noches de nostalgia
De mis sue√±os y esperanzas

Dulce fruta que me embriaga
Que se lleva mis tristezas
Y devuelve al fin la calma

Que se quedan en el alma

Si‚ÄÖpor m√≠ fuera, si por m√≠ fuera

Que si por m√≠ fuera inventar√≠a un camino solo a tus caderas

[Verso 1]
Yo le dije: ""arr√©glate"", sin referirme a la ropa
Y ella me dijo: ""no s√©, tampoco me veo tan rota""
Yo era tan poco y como ella hab√≠an tan pocas
Lo m√°s normal que ten√≠a es que parec√≠a tan loca
Yo era el cantante y ella daba la nota
Me contaba mil historias, pero yo nunca era el prota
Ella amaba la lluvia y yo que iba a cuentagotas
Ella ya cambi√≥ por otro y yo no la cambio por otra

Ella quer√≠a cambiarme todo lo que yo no pude antes
Y me robaba el tiempo como si me sobraran instantes
Por m√°s que me quitase, si me llamaba nunca iba tarde
Era como un veneno, pero lo bebo para saciarme
Y parece buena, incluso estando a malas
Y yo la llamo ""cielo"", porque con ella me salen alas
Y algo en m√≠ se me para cuando ella se separa
S√© que la necesito y eso no es bueno, pero me calma
Normal que frene y que frene si ella acelera y me puede
Despu√©s me da la vida y se va, se va
Sabe lo que debe y no quiere, ya que quererme no debe
Ella pregunta y yo le respondo ""ya qu√©""

Ella va caminando desnuda en una cama de estrella
Mi conciencia que se pierda en aquella‚ÄÖbotella
Y‚ÄÖSu sonrisa va‚ÄÖenvolviendo una magia tan bella

Ella esta‚ÄÖcaliente como sol que arde en la arena
Y aunque no quiera y me esconda su pasi√≥n me quema
Con ese fuego que le pertenece solo a ella

Me gusta as√≠ as√≠ as√≠ as√≠ asi
Locos dementes y as√≠ as√≠ me gusta a mi
Tan natural como las olas en el mar
Ya nos queremos enamorar

Si de casualidad te doy un beso imprudente
Y damos rienda suelta a lo que estaba pendiente
Ay que vas a hacer conmigo , que voy a hacer contigo

Porque de amor estamos de locos dementes

Caminando entre la gente por la calle yo te vi
No pude detenerte y los pasos te segui
Despacio, nos fuimos acercando
Con tus ojos yo me encontr√© y tu estabas mirandome

Me gusta as√≠ as√≠ as√≠ as√≠ asi
Locos dementes y as√≠ as√≠ me gusta a mi
Tan natural como las olas en el mar
Ya nos queremos enamorar

Si de casualidad te doy un beso imprudente
Y damos rienda suelta a lo que estaba pendiente
Ay que vas a hacer conmigo , que voy a hacer contigo
Porque de amor estamos Locos dementes

Ella si me quiere y se me suben los niveles y tiene claro que me gusta asi
No hay quien la supere
Y Tiene en regla los papeles
Y siempre baila pegadita al bip

Ella me tiene volando
Ella me esta enamorando

Dice que no espere, que ya no frene
Que por su boca yo me perdi

Me tiene llevado y demas sobre girao
Estoy loquito loco de emoci√≥n
Y esa boquita de melao
Ella me tiene condenado a entregarle mi coraz√≥n
Y siento que le calma mi vaina mi vaina mi vaina
Me gusta como me baila me baila me baila
Con sabor Me vuelvo loco por su amor

Ay ay ay te tengo cerca pero quiero mas
Me tiene en una nube
Que sube sube sube
Ando en una locura que no puedo parar..


Si de casualidad te doy un beso imprudente
Y damos rienda suelta a lo que estaba pendiente
Ay que vas a hacer conmigo , que voy a hacer contigo

Porque de amor estamos de locos dementes

Me gusta as√≠ as√≠ as√≠ as√≠ asi

No me busques pleito, as√≠ que olv√≠dalo
Puedes jugar con otras, pero conmigo no
Si te‚ÄÖpasas‚ÄÖde la raya‚ÄÖes mejor que corras
Y mejor r√©zale‚ÄÖa Dios, adi√≥s

Ten cuidao' si t√∫ tiene' otra falda
Te descubro esa, y las que salgan
La mirada siempre te delata
No me gusta la gente barata

As√≠ que no vengas con tu palabreo
Mucha inmadurez en ti es lo que veo
Yo por ti met√≠ las manos en el fuego
Y te equivocaste feo

Yo siempre estuve ah√≠ pa' ti

Vete pa' la
Vete pa' la
Vete pa' la

[Verso 3]
Tengo una amiga bruja, y otra esp√≠a
La otra trabaja en la CIA
Cuidao' con quien salgas en la foto

Te sale castigo, t√∫ lo mereces
T√∫ no puedes con una a la vez
S√≥lo un est√∫pido hace esa estupidez

Quedamos en nunca volver a hablar
S√© que no debo molestarte
Tal vez parece que estoy bien,‚ÄÖpero‚ÄÖno es cierto

Por encima del sol, por debajo del mar
Sin saber si te llevo o me dejo llevar

Tiempo de vals, tiempo para abrazar
La pasi√≥n que prefieres y hacerla girar
Y elevarse violenta como un hurac√°n

Con tres pasos de baile, una historia de amor
Es tiempo y es en fin

Si t√∫ me quieres y yo te quiero
Si t√∫ me quieres y yo te quiero

[Coro]
No importa lo que digan
Lo que piensen no me molesta
Yo no escucho tonter√≠as
Si est√°n en contra no me interesa
Estamos en las nubes
Les guste o no les guste
No importa lo que digan
(Esc√∫chame papi)

14955,Tab√∫,Pablo Albor√°n,"[Letra de ""Tab√∫ (Versi√≥n piano y voz)""]

[Verso 1]
¬øDe qu√© est√° hecho tu coraz√≥n?
Dime que no est√° vac√≠o
Que yo tengo el m√≠o lleno‚ÄÖde‚ÄÖilusiones contigo
Tic-tac, suena‚ÄÖel reloj, llega el adi√≥s
Socorro, no‚ÄÖtengo bengalas
Si no queda amor, ¬ødime qu√© siento entre el pecho y las alas?

[Pre-Coro]
Si no puedo borrar las estrellas
No me pidas que olvide tu huella

[Coro]
Te busco en cada amanecer
Y en el √∫ltimo rayo de luz
Desarmo mi cuerpo otra vez
Me invento un nuevo tab√∫
Te busco en cada amanecer
Y en el √∫ltimo rayo de luz
Desarmo mi cuerpo otra vez
Me invento un nuevo tab√∫
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verso 2]
¬øDe qu√© manera puedo salvar todo el futuro que fuimos?
¬øEn qu√© momento borraste mi nombre de cada suspiro?
Tic-tac, suena el reloj, llega el adi√≥s
Socorro, no tengo bengalas
Si no queda amor, ¬ødime qu√© siento entre el pecho y las alas?

[Pre-Coro]
Si no puedo borrar las estrellas
No me pidas que olvide tu huella

[Coro]
Te busco en cada amanecer
Y en el √∫ltimo rayo de luz
Desarmo mi cuerpo otra vez
Me invento un nuevo tab√∫
Te busco en cada amanecer
Y en el √∫ltimo rayo de luz
Desarmo mi cuerpo otra vez
Me invento un nuevo tab√∫
Mmm, mmm, uuh, uuh

[Coro]
Te busco en cada amanecer
Y en el √∫ltimo rayo de luz
Desarmo mi cuerpo otra vez
Me invento un nuevo tab√∫
Te busco en cada amanecer
Y en el √∫ltimo rayo de luz
Desarmo mi cuerpo otra vez
Me invento un nuevo tab√∫
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Outro]
Me invento un nuevo tab√∫

Montana
Posty (Hahaha)
Okurr
(La-la-la-la, uhh)
Ayy, uh huh

[Verse 1: French Montana]
From the block, now we're snipin' on the opps like Somalians (Uh-huh)
Egyptian cloth on my body, diamonds like 6ix9ine hair (Hair)
Now we comin' through the back, we don't go to the concierge (Yeah, hey-hey)
Now that boy run fashion, Cardi in that Fashion Nova gear (Ha)
We started the wave, now everybody lookin' the same
Tell me how you want it (Woah)
Shorty buss it down, give us the money, keep the crown
Tell me how you want it
I been around the globe in the Global Express
Ten O's in my net worth, yeah (Huh)
Neck work, then the leg work (Work)
We're the stars like the network (Work, Montana)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
You see the writing on the wall
Hold onto me and I'ma hold ya
You see the writing on the wall
I'll bring it back, bring it back, yeah

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Got a lil' mama in my telephone, she jumpin' out the barrio (Ayy)
Hoes all in my section, I don't want 'em, kick them bitches out like vamanos (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
We can work it out, lil' mama, all we need is just a little cardio (Ayy)
Yeah, she the type of woman if we cannot do it, I will catch a body for (Ooh yeah, yeah)
Call my accountant, bought my bitch new Bimmer, she whip 7-Series, yeah (Ooh yeah, yeah)
I spend whatever, girl, I do whatever to show you I'm serious (Ooh yeah, yeah)
That sound familiar, they just talkin' shit because they feel inferior
Ooh yeah, that's just how we go

[Chorus: Post Malone]
You see the writing on the wall
Hold onto me and I'ma hold ya
You see the writing on the wall
I'll bring it back, bring it back, yeah

[Verse 3: Cardi B & French Montana]
All the millions make 'em horny, Montana
Cardi, we the hottest out the South Bronx, yeah
Made me holla' for a dollar, got my makeup on your collar
You'll be callin' me tomorrow, yeah
And my diamonds like water, you'll be callin' me tomorrow
Then them dress gettin' shorter (Uh huh)
Make you push a little harder, little faster, little deeper (Skrr skrr)
'Fore I promise I be keepin' ya
Said, ""It's all about the level up"", booty like a Jell-O Cup
Bitches hella jealous, wishin' it was them instead of us
I done got hot, dawg, relish, you ain't catchin' up
Gucci, Fendi, Prada, Balenciaga, Margiela, ah
Standin' ovation, the broad of the nation
Me and babe racin the Wraiths, we're adjacent
Wish that we could take the rumors to the bank (To the bank)
We don't have no more room inside the safe (Woo, woo)
But I'ma ball it like a napkin, tap it like it's Jazz-feet
Hold the door for me, then pop me on the ass cheek
Ain't too rich to get it poppin' in the backseat
Next time you want another bitch, you better ask me, ah
Ike and Tina that ass, you better take a bitch you know
Show my name and this pass
And now we're rollin' down the freeway, talkin' 'bout a threeway
Startin' workin' out, but he gon' eat me on his cheat-day off

[Chorus: Post Malone & Cardi B]
You see the writing on the wall
Hold onto me and I'ma hold ya
You see the writing on the wall
I'll bring it back, bring it back, yeah

[Outro: Post Malone & Cardi B]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la (Okurr), ohh
La-la-la (What you want from me?), la-la-la
La-la-la, ohh
