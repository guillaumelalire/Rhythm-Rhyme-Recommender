And twisting me around

Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say

12044,Coffee and TV,Blur,"[Verse 1]
Do you feel like a chainstore?
Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around, bored
Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are

[Chorus]
So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big, bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

[Verse 2]
Do you go to the country?
It isn't very far
There's people there who will hurt you
Because of who you are
Your ears are full of the language
There's wisdom there, you're sure
Until the words start slurring
And you can't find the door

[Chorus]
So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually

12003,Angels,Robbie Williams,"[Verse 1]
I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate?
And do they know the places where we go
When we're grey and old?
'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Verse 2]
When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one-way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

Inventing what you say
Stand at your side
Divided

Said that everything’s for sale
I don’t want in

Ready for autumn, gonna hibernate
Sending at thought up for September rain
To wash the waste away

Come rain
I’m best in autumn, come rain
Won’t be forgotten, come rain

Competing to be sold
As seasons change I've had it

So spend your days
Keeping predators engaged
I don’t want in
Don’t ask

I’m far away
Ready for autumn, gonna hibernate
Sending a thought up for September rain
To wash the waste away

It’s getting late
Me and my pride are gonna hibernate
Staying inside I’m gonna watch and wait
Keep everything away

[Verse 1: $LICK $LOTH]
I'm sinking to unknown levels, the devil with no brake pedal
Stop all this murder, mo' murder, drugs got me cockin' the burner
Run up in your house, duct tape on your mouth
Evil shit, hittin' licks, never a drought
$uicide Grey*59, future is now
Lucifer in the flesh, you'd hear the sound
$ui, $ui-cide, $uicide!
Poppin' these pills, and I'm poppin' these shells
Oxy and heron crushed up in a bill
Feel like I'm watched by the eyes in the hill
$carecrow the menace, but $carecrow don't panic
I called on JGRXXN, and they ready to kill
Lil Uzi cocked, and he ready to drill
Smokin' out, locin' out in a DeVille

[Verse 2: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Roaches swarm around me as I rise and levitate
I be the snake of Genesis leading the Exodus to an unknown place
And claim it's safe, uh!
Gathering sheep to the slaughter, I show 'em the blade
Let them pray to the father and sneak up behind them
And open their veins, the devil in wolf's clothing
Yung Plague attends them demon masquerades
But I ain't mask my face
I pass the blade and ask to trade their soul for cash and fame
I scratch these names off of my list
I trash the place and dip back to my pit of ash and bones and hibernate
My sack of souls ain't gon' escape

Watch me hypnotize you niggas 'cause JGRXXN got that phonk
I'm ridin' in a steamer with some bodies in the trunk
Jug mane, jug mane, you not the jug, mane
False flaggin' niggas, come and catch a blast, mane
These Schema-icide niggas always burning up the trunk
We runnin' down yo lane, I don't pull up I always dunk
I never gave a fuck about these niggas wanna play
And if you with the shit, please believe we on the way

Hustle the maniac
Quick attack, you can't relax, you can't relax
So on your back, you even know I'd bust your ass
Be like fuck the cash but need the cash
Hustle passion for the love of bands
I kill a man; I rob a man, I be fiendin' bad
But damn if I tell you that
You be lurkin' in my business fast
Like “The fuck boy, how you doin' that?”
Before you know it I be at your neck
Like the dead, he vanish to a mist (Hustle!)
He see the noose that come up out the group
In the trunk we let bodies sit
Suicide the way we slittin' wrists
Roll the blunt then put it to my lips
Torch a car just for the love of chips
It's Hustle!

G-G-G*59 talking to the devil plot another 'nother crime
Elevate above the clouds, looking for the sun
When I fell from the heavens was losin' my mind
Rip off my wings, and I take off my halo
I'm looking for god but didn't find shit
So I slept with the devil, I sold my soul quick
I was fucking and then-then I made it my bitch
Murder suicidal, grippin' the rifle, hand on the Bible
Believe in false idols you living in dreams, but I'm stuck in reality thinking of schemes
Loss in the darkness where I become heartless
I creep through the night, and I keep my blade sharp
And I'm stuck in my wave
'Cause I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm throwing my elbows, I'm gettin' too buck

Fill the home that I live in

12001,Last Resort,Papa Roach,"[Intro]
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort

[Verse 1]
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort – suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

[Verse 2]
I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself, and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm runnin' and I'm cryin'
I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
I can't go on living this way

[Verse 3]
Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm runnin' and I'm cryin'
I can't go on living this way

Nothing's alright

12023,When You Were Young,The Killers,"[Verse 1]
You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

[Chorus 1]
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young

[Verse 2]
Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

[Chorus 2]
We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young

[Interlude]
And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But more than you'll ever know

12000,In the End,Linkin Park,"[Intro: Chester Bennington]
It starts with one

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Chorus]
I'm not in love, no, no

Faith, you're driving me away
You do it every day
You don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung

Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you

Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door

I'll never be as great as
I want to be
Everyone that I run into
The ones you always seem so into
What's wrong with me?

They all seem to know exactly
What it is they want, they pass me
They smile as they go
So I work at staying patient
Good things come to those that wait
Or so they say

I'm so empty
You're all I'm thinking about
About, oh oh
About, about, oh oh oh
About, about, oh oh oh
About, about

I get tired of trying
Ideas die on the vine and
I feel like a fake
I lie awake believing
That somehow I keep failing
I rail and I ache
At the monsters and the demons
I've wrestled with for eons
And I want to destroy

I'm so empty
You're all I talk about
Oh oh out
You're all I talk about

Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice

[Verse 2]
And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
He called Alice
When she was just small

[Verse 3]
When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the White Knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's off with her head
Remember what the Dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your head

You know we're friends till we die

But either way you turn, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard

Who's got the loneliest feeling

12071,Cargo Cult,Mick Harvey,"I know of the sorcerers who summon the jets
From the jungles of New Guinea
They survey the skies coveting the money
That pillaging would bring them from that freight

On the Coral Sea, in the wake of that
Machine, those creatures who have no need
Of reason, those Papuans wait to see
The wreck of an Airbus and of a Comet

And because their totem hasn't ever been able to bring down
Either a Boeing or even a Fokker to the ground
They dream of hijacks and of collisions with gulls

Those naive ship-wreckers armed now
With blowguns who make sacrifice to the cargo cult
As towards the sky and the airplanes their poison darts are bound

Where are you Melody and your lost frame
Is it haunting the archipelago where the sirens are becalmed?
Or is it clinging to the plane whose alarm
Siren has gone silent, did you remain?

Floating on the currents, have you already found
Those luminous corals of the Guinean coasts and sailed
Where those indigenous sorcerers still hope in vain
For planes to be brought to the ground?

Having nothing to lose nor a God to believe in
And so that they might return my trivial passions
I, like them, I call to the night cargo planes

And I hold onto that hope of an aviation disaster
That would bring Melody back again
A child taken captive by the lure of the stars there

What was your name?
Melody
Melody what?
Melody Nelson

When they made him, they broke the mold
If he heads this way, when the moon is slow
Come over and pray, they'll turn the buffalo
They'll turn the buffalo

There's a need to sleep in the shag of his stomach
Slide around his eye with your love in tow
If he heads this way, don't you say hello
Get out of the way, they'll turn the buffalo
They'll turn the buffalo

Our town, our town, do love a stampede
Stampede by my old jacket in the park

Into the road of sadness
I'm walking without you

I'm falling in sorrow
Dead to the world you left me
In footsteps I follow

12076,My Death,Scott Walker,"My death is like
A swinging door
A patient girl who knows the score
Whistle for her
And the passing time

My death waits like
A bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
Weep loud for that
And the passing time

My death waits like
A witch at night
And surely as our love is bright
Let's laugh for us
And the passing time

But whatever is behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I don't care
For in front of that door
There is you

My death waits like
A beggar blind
Who sees the world with an unlit mind
Throw him a dime
For the passing time

My death waits
To allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
Let's drink to that
And the passing time

My death waits in
Your arms, your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not talk about
The passing time

But whatever is behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I don't care
For in front of that door
There is you

My death waits
Among the falling leaves
In magicians, mysterious sleeves
Rabbits, dogs
And the passing time

My death waits
Among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow cowers
Let's pick lilacs
For the passing time

My death waits in
A double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
Pull up the sheets
Against the passing time

But whatever is behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I don't care
For in front of that door
There is you

12085,Chocolate Jesus,Tom Waits,"Well, I don't go to church on Sunday
Don't get on my knees to pray
Don't memorize the books of the Bible
I got my own special way

I know Jesus loves me
Maybe just a little bit more
I fall on down on my knees every Sunday
At Zerelda Lee's candy store

Well, it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Makes me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied

Well, I don't want no Abba Zabba
Don't want no Almond Joy
There ain't nothing better
Suitable for this boy

Well, it's the only thing that can pick me up
Better than a cup of gold
See only a chocolate Jesus
Can satisfy my soul

When the weather gets rough and it's whiskey in the shade
It's best to wrap your savior up in cellophane
He flows like the big muddy, but that's okay
Pour him over ice cream for a nice parfait

Well, it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Good enough for me
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
It's good enough for me

Well, it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel so good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied

12067,Red Right Hand,Arctic Monkeys,"[Verse 1]
Take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires and the humming wires
Well, you know you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks

[Chorus]
On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

[Verse 2]
He'll wrap you in his arms and tell ya that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all of those dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
And there won't be a single thing that you can do
He's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru

[Chorus]
They're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand

[Verse 3]
You don't have no money? He'll get you some
If you haven't got no car, he'll get you one
You've got no self-respect, you feel like an insect
Well, don't you worry, buddy, 'cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrows
And the Bowery and the slums

[Chorus]
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
You'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems
You'll see him in your head and on the TV screen
Hey, buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru

[Chorus]
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by his red right hand

What is this horror, mama, flooding over me
They return, the Nazis, every 70 years
Bombs explode in Paris, the future is here
There's no brave England, no brave Russia, no America
(Ah-hah!)
Their sins come home to haunt us
From the wrong side of the gun

Who is that creepin' up the stairs in black?
It's a murderer Mama, knife you in the back
They come at night, and the world goes blind with fear
Terror in Paris, the future is here
Cry for them, cry for us, playing the game of death
(Ah hah!)
It's not a game when you are
Down to taking your last breath
(Whoah oh!)

They come at night Mama, just like before
Turn the streets to blood red rivers
Turn your eyes no more
They come at night, and the world goes blind with fear
Iron bars in Europe, the future is here
Those who survived that night are still completely traumatized
(Whoah oh!)
But the other souls unlucky
Shot like dogs between the eyes

There's no brave England, no brave Russia, no America
Their sins come home to haunt us
From the wrong side of the gun

12062,My Way,Sid Vicious,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
You cunt, I'm not a queer
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that´s full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did, what I had to do
And saw it through with out exemption
I planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

There were times, I'm sure you knew
When there was fuck fuck fuck-all else to do
But through it all, when there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced the wall and the world
And did it my way

I've laughed and been a snide
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think, I killed a cat
And may I say, not in a gay way
Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a prat, what has he got
When he wears hats and he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words, of one who kneels
The record shows, I fucked a bloke
And did it my way

I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, Joe
You were standing in the middle of an open road
I had a dream, Joe
Your hands were raised up to the sky
And your mouth was covered in foam
I had a dream, Joe
A shadowy Jesus, he flitted from tree to tree
I had a dream, Joe
The society of whores stuck needles in an image of me
I had a dream, Joe
It was Autumn time and thickly fell the leaves
And in that dream, Joe
A pimp in seersucker suit sucked a toothpick
And pointed his finger at me

[Chorus]
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe

[Verse 2]
I opened my eyes, Joe
The night had been a giant, a-dribbling and pacing the boards
I opened my eyes, Joe
All your letters and cards all stacked up against the door
I opened my eyes, Joe
The morning light came slowly tumbling through the crack
In the window, Joe
And I thought of you, man
And I felt like I was lugging a body on my back

I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream, Joe

Where did you go, Joe?
On that endless, on that senseless, on that demented drift
Where did you go, Joe?
It was into the woods, it was into the trees
Where you move and shift
Where did you go, Joe?
All dressed up in your ridiculous seersucker suit
Where did you go, Joe?
With that strew of wreckage
Forever at the heel of your boot

12087,Bells & Circles,Underworld,"If I had wings
I wouldn't do anything beautiful and transcendent
No
I'd get my finger into everything I wanted
I'd do all the beautiful things
Those things you can't do
Because nobody wants you to be able to do
The things that make you feel good
Like you can't smoke on the airplane
I remember smoking on the airplane
I used to love to smoke on the airplane
Those were the golden days of air travel
They would just open the door at the airport
And you'd walk right out the tarmac
And up those stairs and light a big cigarette
And stick it in the ashtray
And the stewardess would come along
And if she was hot, you can try to pick her up
Once I was flying
From New York to DC
I didn't have much time
And the stewardess was smoking
She was a dusky tall
American beauty
And I put down my tray table
Snorted a gram of cocaine
Till I got up my courage to say
""Can I have your phone number?""
And she gave me the number
That was the good news
The bad news was I got too stoned and I'd lost the number
The stewardess would've been better than the cocaine
I made an error in judgement
But still I remember smoking on the airplane

Smoking on the airplane
Smoking on the airplane, everybody did it
They'd gather at the back on the way to Australia
And all puff up at once outside the bathroom
And that's why if I had wings
That would be a bad idea, hahahahaha, I guess
According to everything I've been taught about the laws of
Ethics and karma and good behavior, hahahahaha
If I had wings, I'd go, yum, yum, yum-yum, yum-yum, yum, ow!
I'd have fun
If I had wings, I'd have fun

Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren
Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday
Found it in the street
At first, I did not see
Lying at my feet a trampled rose

Passing the hat in church
It never stops going round
You never pay just once to get the job done
What I done to me
I done to you
So what happened to the trampled rose?

In the muddy street, with the fireworks and leaves
A blind man with a cup I asked
If he would sing ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine""
I know this rose like I know my name
The one I gave my love
It was the same
Now I find it in the street, a trampled rose

On Jubilee Street there was a girl named Bea
She had a history, but she had no past
When they shut her down, the Russians moved in
Now I'm too scared, I'm too scared to even walk on past
She used to say:
All those good people down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
Here they ought to practice just what they preach
Those good people on Jubilee Street
And here I come up the hill
I'm pushing my own wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain
And I'm pushing my wheel of love on Jubilee Street
Ah, look at me now

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well, a girl’s gotta make ends meet
Even down on Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time, and over the hill, and out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to practice what I preach
These days I go downtown in my tie and tails
I got a fetus on a leash
I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations
The curtains are shut, the furniture is gone
I’m transforming, I’m vibrating, I’m glowing
I’m flying, look at me now
I’m flying, look at me now

12092,Fire Is Coming,Flying Lotus,"[Spoken Word: David Lynch]
The yellow phone on the wall started ringing. Tommy jumped, then ran across the kitchen and picked up the receiver. ""Hello?"" he said, a little out of breath. Tommy's father was downstairs in the basement wood shop cutting a piece of clear pine on the table saw. The sound of the saw was screechingly loud, and a big plume of agitated sawdust was forming in the air. Tommy's mother was outside on the front lawn tending to a small flower garden. She was visibly upset about her flowers' condition. She was observing a black film on the stems and leaves, then trying to wipe this black substance away while running hose water on it, but it was too greasy, and the water wasn't washing it away. The front door opened and Tommy appeared behind his mother. ""Mom, there's a phone call for you."" Tommy's mom stood up and turned, the garden hose in her right hand shooting water. ""Who is it?"" she asked. ""I don't know. It's a man. He said you would know what it's about."" Tommy's mom stood frozen for a moment, and Tommy saw lines of worry racing across her face. Something else scrambled into Tommy's awareness. He saw that the sky was noticeably darker than usual, and he saw a huge, red-orange glow moving on the horizon. Just then, a man appeared running frantically in the street, the man yelling, ""Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming!""

[Chorus]
There's a fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move your feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move your feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet

12090,Romeo Had Juliette,Lou Reed,"[Verse 1]
Caught between the twisted stars
The plotted lines the faulty map
That brought Columbus to New York
Betwixt between the East and West
He calls on her wearing a leather vest
The earth squeals and shudders to a halt
A diamond crucifix in his ear
Is used to help ward off the fear
That he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Inside his pants he hides a mop
To clean the mess that he has dropped
Into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell

[Chorus]
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo

[Verse 2]
Romeo Rodriguez squares
His shoulders and curses Jesus
Runs a comb through his black pony-tail
He's thinking of his lonely room
The sink that by his bed gives off a stink
Then smells her perfume in his eyes
And her voice was like a bell

[Verse 3]
Outside the streets were steaming
The crack dealers were dreaming
Of an Uzi someone had just scored
I betcha I could hit that light
With my one good arm behind my back
Says little Joey Diaz
Brother give me another toke
Those downtown hoods are no damn good
Those Italians need a lesson to be taught
This cop who died in Harlem
You think they'd get the warnin'
I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street

[Chorus]
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo

[Verse 4]
I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag
With Latin written on it that says
""it's hard to give a shit these days""
Manhattan's sinking like a rock
Into the filthy Hudson what a shock
They wrote a book about it
They said it was like ancient Rome
The perfume burned his eyes
Holding tightly to her thighs
And something flickered for a minute
And then it vanished and was gone
"
12095,Octopus,Syd Barrett,"[Verse 1]
Trip to heave and ho
Up down, to and fro'
You have no word
Trip, trip to a dream dragon
Hide your wings in a ghost tower
Sails cackling at every plate we break
Cracked by scattered needles
The little minute gong coughs and clears his throat
Madam you see before you stand
Hey ho, never be still
The old original favorite grand
Grasshoppers green Herbarian band
And the tune they play is ""In Us Confide""
So trip to heave and ho
Up down, to and fro'
You have no word

[Chorus]
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

[Verse 2]
Isn't it good to be lost in the wood
Isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood
Meant even less to me than I thought
With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed ...
Well, the madcat laughed
At the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the Talbot
""Cheat"" he cried shouting kangaroo
It's true in their tree they cried

[Chorus]
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

[Verse 3]
The madcat laughed
At the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the Talbot
The winds they blew and the leaves did wag
They'll never put me in their bag
The seas will reach and always seep
So high you go, so low you creep
The wind it blows in tropical heat
The drones they throng on mossy seats
The squeaking door will always creak
Two up, two down we'll never meet
So merrily trip forgo my side

[Chorus]
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

I'll give you 21, 21, 21

This night you are mistaken
I'm a farmer in the city
Dark farm houses 'gainst the sky
Every night I must wonder why
Harness on the left nail
Keeps wrinkling, wrinkling
Then higher above me
Esau, Esau
Can't go by a man  from Rio
Go by a man from Vigo
Can't go by a man  from Ostia
Hey, Ninetto
Remember that dream?
We talked about it so many times

Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21
Do I hear 21, 21, 21?

And if I'm not mistaken
We can search from farm to farm
Dark farm houses 'gainst our eyes
Every night I must realize
Harness on the left nail
Keeps withering and withering
Then higher above me
Esau, Esau
Can't go by a man in this shirt
Go by a man in that shirt
Can't go by a man with brain grass
Go by his long long eye gas
And I used to be a citizen
And I never felt the pressure
I knew nothing of the horses
Nothing of the thresher
Paolo, take me with you?
It was the journey of a life

[Chorus]
Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21
Do I hear 21, 21, 21?
I'll give you 21, 21, 21

Stop makin' the eyes at me
I'll stop makin' the eyes at you
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to

[Pre-Chorus]
And your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're lookin' for romance or

Well, from 1984

I wish you'd stop ignorin' me
Because it's sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair

Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand

Well, from 1984

And no, there in't no love, no
Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness

Well, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're lookin' for romance or
I don't know what you're lookin' for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancin' to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Said, from 1984

12081,Grace,Jeff Buckley,"[Verse 1]
There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die
My fading voice sings of love
But she cries to the clicking of time, oh, time

[Chorus]
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire

[Verse 2]
And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow, oh my love
And the rain is falling and I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain I might leave, leave behind

[Chorus]
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire

(It reminds me of the pain)
I might leave, leave behind
And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow

Wait, wait, wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait ah uh unh ah

I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now

Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

12053,The Black Angel's Death Song,The Velvet Underground,"[Verse 1]
The myriad choices of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
What had he to lose?
Not a ghost bloodied country all covered with sleep
Where the Black Angel did weep not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

[Verse 2]
And wandering's brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull
Shrill yell
Shining brightly red-rimmed and redlined with the time
Effused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

[Verse 3]
Cut mouth bleeding razors
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains coo goodbye
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gonna choose, choose again

[Verse 4]
Sacrificials remain make it hard to forget
Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize pain
Choose again
And Robermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
With the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

[Verse 5]
And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
And if the stone glances off, split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose
If you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
Start the game

I che che, che che I
Che che che, ka tah koh
Choose to choose
Choose to choose, choose to go

Can you feel it coming in the air tonight? Oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 1]
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord

Well, I remember, I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time
The last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
Well, the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

Something in the sky, sky
Waiting there for me

The outer lock rolled slowly back

Lafawnduh's going to take us to the place
Where we can stand and stare out into space
Cardboard goggles propped before our eyes
Sunburned faces gazing to the skies
Pops says it's like watching drying paint
We're impressed but obviously he ain't
Not really his idea of fun
Waiting for the moon to shield the sun

South of the path
Of totality

When Shiner was just a mini boy
His science teacher thought he might enjoy
A shadowbox of empty Captain Crunch
So he could watch the eclipse after lunch
Standing out on the Snake Canyon rim
He's staring up and she's staring at him
Wondering where his mind has run
Waiting for the moon to shield the sun

South of the path
Of totality
South of the path
Of totality

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's getting dimmer, a chill is in the air
Baffled flies are buzzing everywhere
Armed with his plastic swatter sword
Pops battles so he won't be bored
The Cheshire Cat dodges behind the moon
An eerie haze glooms the afternoon
Lafawnduh's primed and ready for her run
As the moon chases away the sun

[Chorus]
South of the path
Of totality

12126,Axolotl,The Veils,"[Verse]
I'm glowing bright, obsidian
Axolotl amphibian
Un-elemental chemical
Got me growing six black tentacles
A little nightmarish, a little maudlin
Good golly go get that kid some laudanum
Salvation's more than I can afford
Who needs the Devil when you've got the Lord?

[Chorus]
Oh my soul
Losing control
Who built this heart?
Oh my God

[Verse]
Now sister Maggie's coming in fleet-foot
Baby's got a belly full of black soot
I got the feeling I better just stay put
And she'll love you better than any real man could
An accidental amphibian
I'm growing giddy as a Gideon
Another head for the chopping board
Who needs the Devil when you've got the Lord?

[Chorus]
Oh my soul
Losing control
Who built this heart?
Oh my God
"
12100,Red Right Hand,PJ Harvey,"[Verse 1]
Take a little walk to the edge of town
Go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand

[Verse 2]
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand
"
12120,Snake Eyes,Trouble,
12130,Paper Tiger,Beck,"[Verse 1]
Just like a paper tiger
Torn apart by idle hands
Through the helter skelter morning
Fix yourself while you still can
No more ashes to ashes
No more cinders from the sky
Let all the laws of creation
Tell a dead man how to die

[Chorus]
Oh, deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

[Verse 2]
Looking through a broken diamond
To make the past what it should be
Through the ruins and the weather
Capsized boats in the sea

[Chorus]
Oh, deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

[Bridge]
We're just holding on to nothing
To see how long nothing lasts

[Chorus]
Oh, deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

[Outro]
There's one road to the morning
There's one road to the truth
There's one road back to civilization
But there's no road back to you
"
12128,Dawn Chorus,Thom Yorke,"Back up the cul-de-sac
Come on, do your worst
You quit your job again
And your train of thought
If you could do it all again
A little fairy dust
A thousand tiny birds singing
If you must, you must
Please let me know
When you’ve had enough
Of the white light
Of the dawn chorus
If you could do it all again
You don't know how much
Pronto pronto, moshi mosh
Come on, chop chop

If you could do it all again
Yeah, without a second thought
I don't like leaving
The door shut
I think I missed something
But I'm not sure what
In the middle of the vortex
The wind picked up
Shook up the soot
From the chimney pot
Into spiral patterns
Of you, my love

You take a little piece
Then you break it off
It's a bloody racket
It’s the dawn chorus
If you could do it all again
Big deal, so what?
Please let me know
When you've had enough
It's the last chance
O.K. Corral
If you could do it all again
This time with style

12110,Rides Through The Morning,Michael Nau,"[Verse 1]
Farm away hose sad eyes
I swim for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Your light to touch the song back to my soul
Go by the breeze, I'm bound to pine
You will always come to mine
And rescue my dream down this marvelous stream
Where holy waters overflow

[Chorus]
For good the ship rides through the morning
When the darkness drowns all
Beyond the shell somebody’s burning
You know it's calling, you know it's calling me back home
Put down your sorrows and dance with me
That worried mind in a trance to me
The stars that swim across your brows
Waiting through this night I scout
We made a real romance
Put down your sorrows and dance with me

[Verse 1]
Beside your shadow there’s a painting
That died, ooh you're a lovely flower
Here comes the spring
Let it touch the song back in my soul
And if by this bridge I piss and pine
This feeling always, always, always, always comes to mind
Every time that your song goes back into my soul

[Chorus]
Alas the ship rides through the morning
When the darkness aptly grows
Now every bit of the, bit of the, bit of the, bit of the sun is shining
I feel it calling, feel it calling me back home
Put down your sorrows and dance with me
That worried mind in a trance to me
The stars that swim across your brows
Waiting through this night I scout
We made a real romance with me
Put down your sorrows and dance with me
Oh put down your sorrows and dance with me
Oh put down your sorrows and dance with me
Oh put down your sorrows and dance with me

12127,A Real Indication,Thought Gang,"So I'm goin' down this street
And I'm tryin' not to smile
'Cause the street is where I'm goin'
And the curb is at the side
By the sewer
Where the rain goes down

Like this girl I once knew
'Cause the sewer is so hollow
And the yell
Could last forever

Like the night my girl went away
Gone off in a world filled with stuff
Lights start changin'
And there's wires in the air
And the asphalt man
Is all around me

And I look down
And my shoes are so far away from me, man
I can't believe it

I got a real indication
Of a laugh comin' on
I got a real indication
Of a laugh comin' on

That old wind
Is howling like a cold steel train
Girl has left me
Not comin' back again

Got rusted bullet holes in the Dodge
And a heartburn like a solar flare
The grass by the house is dry, man

And a horsefly
Buzzes, buzzes, buzzes
By the big mistake In the distance, man
I see myself, I see myself start to smile

I got a real indication (He-ha, he-ha, he-ha-ha-ha)
Of a laugh comin' on

So I'm going down this street
And I'm trying not to smile

Could last forever

Like the night my girl went away
Gone off in a world filled with stuff
Lights start changin'

And you can't sleep

You're sitting down to dress, and you're a mess
You look in the mirror

You look in your eyes
Say you realize

Everybody goes, leaving those
Who fall behind

Everybody goes, as far as they can
They don't just care

They stood on the stairs
Laughing at your airs

Your mother's dead, she said
""Don't be afraid""

Your mother's dead, you're on your own
She's in her bed

Everybody goes, leaving those
Who fall behind

Everybody goes, as far as they can
They don't just care

You're a wasted face, you're a sad-eyed lie
You're a holocaust

Am I who you think about in bed

12129,Jigsaw Falling Into Place,Radiohead,"[Verse 1]
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

[Verse 2]
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
A jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, and you look back
Not just once, and not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place

Appealing only 'cause they're just that unappealing
Any practiced Catholic would cross themselves upon entering
The rooms have a hint of asbestos
And maybe just a dash of formaldehyde
And the habit of decomposing
Right before your very, la-la-la-la, eyes

[Chorus]
Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

[Post-Chorus]
Tonight's tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday
The missus will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money
A wonderful caricature of intimacy
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
And not to mention the constable
And his proposition for that ""virgin""
Yes, the one the lawyer met with on ""strictly business""
As he said to the missus
Well, only hours before, after he had left
She was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a ""purse"" of a different kind

[Chorus]
Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

[Bridge]
There are no
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

[Chorus]
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

[Cello Solo]

[Bridge]
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and the girls in white dresses
And the sleeping with the roaches and the taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

12119,Lords of the Backstage,Marillion,"A love song with no validity
Pretend you never meant that much to me
Numb, a vallium child, bored by meaningless collisions
A lonely stretch of headlight, diamonds trapped in black ice
A mirror cracked along the white lines
I just wanted you to be the first one
I just wanted you to be the first one
Ashes are burning, burning
Ashes are burning, burning
A lifestyle with no simplicities
But I'm not asking for your sympathies
Talk, we never could talk, distanced by all that was between us
A lord of the backstage, a creature of language
I'm so far out and I'm too far in
I just wanted you to be the first one
I just wanted you to be the first one
Bridges are burning, burning
Bridges are burning, burning
Now, now, now, now

And something's breakin' up (Breakin' up)
I feel like givin' up (Like givin' up)
I won't walk out until you know

Leave a note for you, my only one
And I know you can see right through me
So let me go, and you will find someone

You are my only one

Well, if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way

For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay, I'm not okay, hey hey, hey
I'm not okay, hey, hey
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)

To be a joke and, look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

[Verse 1]
How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror
So how do you choose?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

[Verse 2]
Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this every day and all day?
Now how did we wind up this way
Watching our mouths for the words that we say?
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes or the soles that we choose
How do we get there today
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her

And while she looks so sad and lonely there

A grown man walking in my garden
I find it strange, find it so alarming
I've got my blade, gonna put it where his heart is

First of all, there is no god
Cause I went out and killed my god
And laid his body in the dirt
I killed him clean, so it did not hurt

And now the moon is full
The moon is wide
The moon it makes, waters rise

And weave the waves, in the deep
The kind of calm, I hope to keep

There's a grown man walking in my garden
A grown man walking in my garden
I find it strange, find it so alarming
I've got my blade, gonna put it where his heart is

Always see it on T.V.​
Or read in the magazines
Celebrities who want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talking about how hard life can be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall, they would fall, fall...

[Chorus]
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

[Verse 2]
Well, did you know if you were famous you could
Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were
Smoking crack, McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.​

As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never goin', never showin' up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearin' ""act your age""

[Chorus]
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

[Verse 2]
Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense, and
Cuttin' people down is just a minor offense, then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Don't count on me

Well, I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothin'
You be standin' on the corner talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffin'
'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringin' off the hook
You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion

I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

[Pre-Chorus]
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Bridge]
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

[Chorus]
And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Outro]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
In the place we used to start our lives

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

12137,My Own Worst Enemy,Lit,"[Verse 1]
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me
Please tell me

[Chorus]
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard, and I'm
Sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone

[Verse 2]
It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going off, and there's a cigarette
Still burning

Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard, and I'm
Sleeping with my clothes on
Came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone

My car is in the front yard, and I'm

Hanging around, downtown by myself
And I had so much time to sit and think about myself
And then there she was, like double cherry pie
Yeah, there she was, like disco super-fly

I smell sex and candy here, mmm
Who's that lounging in my chair? Mmm
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
Momma this surely is a dream, yeah

Tied to me tight, tie me up again

Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock, and sweet you roll

12160,Drops of Jupiter,Train,"[Verse 1]
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracin' her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, yeah
Now that she's back in the atmosphere, I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Chorus]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (Light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star?

12173,Walkin' On The Sun,Smash Mouth,"[Verse 1]
It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack, I know it went out but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it
Just to stay in the clique

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

[Verse 2]
Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression, and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened?
Then some were spellbound, some were hell-bound, some, they fell down
And some got back up and fought back against the meltdown
And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

[Organ Solo]

[Verse 3]
It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

[Outro]
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies while the slaves are all workin'

12156,Photograph,Nickelback,"[Verse 1]
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

[Verse 2]
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
Every time I do, it makes me

12193,Numb,Linkin Park,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

12176,The Way,Fastball,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They made up their minds and they started packing
And left before the sun came up that day
An exit to eternal summer slacking
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Verse 2]
They drank up the wine and they got to talking
But now had more important things to say
And when the car broke down, they started walking
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
They'll never get hungry
They'll never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home, but they really don't care
They wanted the highway
They're happier there today, today

[Verse 3]
The children woke up, and they couldn't find them
They left before the sun came up that day
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em (Leavin' it all behind)
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold

12151,Tounge Tied,Faber Drive,"Bright cold silver moon
Tonight alone in my room
You were here just yesterday
Slight turn of a head
Eyes down when you said
I guess I need my life to change
Seems like some things just aren't the same
What could I say

I need a little more luck than a little bit
Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit
And every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by
I need a little more help than a little bit
Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet
Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by this time

I stare up at the stars
I wonder just where you are
You feel a million miles away
(I wonder just where you are)
Was it something I said
Or something I never did
Or was I always in the way
(Was it something I did)
Can someone tell me what to say
To just make you stay

I need a little more luck than a little bit
Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit
And every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by
I need a little more help than a little bit
Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet
Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by this time

Now it feels like the end
Don't wanna be here again
And we could help each other
Off the ground so we never fall down again
And what it takes I don't care
We're gonna make it I swear
And we could help each other
Off the ground so we never fall down again
Again

I need a little more luck than a little bit
Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit
But every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by
I need a little more help than a little bit
Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet
Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied
I need a little good luck to get me by this time

Now it feels like the end
Don't wanna be here again
And we could help each other
Off the ground so we never fall down again
And what it takes I don't care
We're gonna make it I swear

12182,It's Not Over,Daughtry,"[Verse 1]
I was blown away
What could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything
And I can't deal with that
I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
We'll blow it away, blow it away

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

[Chorus]
Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

[Verse 2]
I've taken all I could take
And I cannot wait
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on
Can't let it bring us down
My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
I'll blow it away, blow it away

Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

We can't let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself
Let it out

12181,Hey Leonardo,Blessid Union Of Souls,"[Verse 1]
She don't care about my car
And she don't care about my money
And that's real good 'cause I don't got a lot to spend
But if I did, it wouldn't mean nothing

[Chorus]
She likes me for me
Not because I look like Tyson Beckford
With the charm of Robert Redford
Oozing out my ears
But what she sees
Are my faults and indecisions
My insecure conditions
And the tears upon the pillow that I shed

[Verse 2]
She don't care about my big screen
Or my collection of DVD's
Things like that just never mattered much to her
Plus she don't watch too much TV
And she don't care that I can fly her
To places she ain't never been
But if she really wants to go
I think deep down she knows that
All she has to say is when

[Chorus]
She likes me for me
Not because I hang with Leonardo
Or that guy who played in ""Fargo""
I think his name is Steve
She's the one for me
And I just can't live without her
My arms belong around her
And I'm so glad I found her once again
And I'm so glad I found her once again
Yeah, I'm so glad I found her once again (Come on)

[Bridge]
Gazing at the ceiling
As we entertain our feelings in the dark
The things that we're afraid of
Are gonna show us what we're made of in the end

[Chorus 2]
She likes me for me
Not because I sing like Pavarotti
Or because I'm such a hottie
I like her for her
Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford
She has got so much to offer
Why does she waste all her time with me?
There must be something there that I don't see
I don't see

[Chorus]
She likes me for me
Not because I'm tough like Dirty Harry
Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey
Unlike the ""Cable Guy""
But what she sees
Is that I can't live without her
My arms belong around her
And I'm so glad I found her once again
(She likes me for me)
Found her once again (She likes me for me)
Once again (She likes me for me)
Yeah, I'm so glad I found her once again

I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather
Cause lately all we do is fight
And every time it cuts me deeper
Cause somethin’s changed
You been actin’ so strange
And it’s taken its toll on me
It’s safe to say that I’m ready to let you leave

[Chorus]
Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I’m seein’ myself so differently
I didn’t wanna believe it then
But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I’d say I’m fine
Without you

Called you up cause it’s been long enough
And you said that you were so much better
We have done a lot of growing up
We were never meant to be together

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause somethin changed
You were actin’ so strange
And it’s taken its toll on me
It’s safe to say that I’m ready to let you leave

[Chorus]
Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I’m seein’ myself so differently
I didn’t wanna believe it then
But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I’d say I’m fine
Without you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause somethin changed
You were actin’ so strange
And it’s taken its toll on me
It’s safe to say that I’m ready to let you leave

[Chorus]
Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I’m seein’ myself so differently
I didn’t wanna believe it then
But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I’d say I’m fine
Without you

[Outro]
Without you
Without you
Without you

I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather

12158,Better Days,The Goo Goo Dolls,"[Verse 1]
And you ask me what I want this year
And I try to make this kind and clear
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
'Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
And designer love and empty things
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

[Chorus]
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

[Verse 2]
I need someplace simple where we could live
And something only you can give
And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child who saved this world
And there's 10 million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them

[Chorus]
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

[Bridge]
I wish everyone was loved tonight
And somehow stop this endless fight
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

[Chorus]
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

[Outro]
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

12150,Jenny,The Click Five,"[Verse 1]
She calls me ""Baby""
Then she won't call me
Says she adores me
And then ignores me
Jenny, what's the problem?
She keeps her distance
And sits on fences
Puts up resistance
And builds defenses
Jenny, what's the problem?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You leave me hangin' on the line
Every time you change your mind

[Chorus]
First you say you won't
Then you say you will
You keep me hangin' on
And we're not movin' on
Or standin' still
Jenny, you've got me on my knees
Jenny, it's killin' me

She needs her own space
She's playin' mind games
Ends up at my place
Sayin' that she's changed
Jenny, what's the problem?

I'm trying to read between the lines
You got me goin' out of my mind

She lays down on the fresh lawn
She can make everything magical
But she tied one on big time

12175,One Headlight,The Wallflowers,"[Verse 1]
So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

[Verse 2]
I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

[Bridge]
Hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

[Verse 4]
She said, ""It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade""
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

[Verse 5]
And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

[Bridge]
Hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 6]
Well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
What smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

[Verse 7]
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home

12192,Scars,Papa Roach,"[Intro]
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 1]
I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just want to be alone
I'm pissed 'cause you came around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause I've channeled all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is:

I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
Tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you goin' down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
And I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real

And I just want to be alone
You should've never come around
Why don’t you just go home?

And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn’t understand
(But you didn’t understand)
Go fix yourself!

[Bridge]
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life

[Chorus]
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

Sometimes I wish she was you

12199,Higher,Creed,"[Verse 1]
When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high, I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Set up high, I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be

I told myself I won’t miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While lookin’ through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were lookin’ for
If there’s one memory I don’t wanna lose

Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
""I wanna get out of this""
I wonder is there anything
I'm gonna miss

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there?
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to?
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around?
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

And how's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore?
And how's it going to be?
Wanna get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I wanna taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion (Oblivion)

How's it going to be?
When you don't know me anymore?
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

And emeralds from mountains that thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth

12177,Barely Breathing,Duncan Sheik,"[Verse 1]
I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care

You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take

Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied, without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

[Verse 2]
You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared

12165,Every Morning,Sugar Ray,"[Verse 1]
Every mornin' there's a halo hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again, as predicted, left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reelin', stopped me from believin'
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it, you know I wanna do it again

[Chorus]
(Sugar Ray say) Oh
(Every mornin') Oh (Every mornin' when I wake up)
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Oh (She always rights the wrong)
Oh (She always rights, she always rights)
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)

[Verse 2]
Every mornin' there's a heartache hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Somethin' so deceiving, when you stop believin'
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it, you know I wanna do it again

Oh

12167,Inside Out,Eve 6,"[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Wanna put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

[Verse 1]
I burn, burn like a wicker cabinet
Chalk white and oh-so-frail
I see our time has gotten stale
The tick-tock of the clock is painful
All sane and logical
I wanna tear it off the wall
I hear words in clips and phrases
I think sick like ginger ale
My stomach turns and I exhale

[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Wanna put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

[Verse 2]
So-Cal is where my mind states
But it's not my state of mind
I'm not as ugly, sad as you
Or am I origami
Folded up and just pretend
Demented as the motives in your head

[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Wanna put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you
(Rendezvous)

[Bridge]
I alone am the one you don't know you need
Take heed, feed your ego
Make me blind when your eyes close
Sink when you get close, tie me to the bedpost
I alone am the one you don't know you need
You don't know you need me
Make me blind when your eyes close
Tie me to the bedpost

[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
The lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothing but faith in nothing
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through, now I'm through with you

[Outro]
Through with you
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

It's not what it was before
All these feelings I've shared
And these are my dreams
That I'd never lived before
Somebody shake me, 'cause I
I must be sleeping

[Chorus]
And now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
And all the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

And these are my words
That I've never said before
I think I'm doing okay
And this is the smile
That I've never shown before
Somebody shake me 'cause I
I must be sleeping

Now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
And all the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

I'm so afraid of waking
Please don't shake me
Afraid of waking
Please don't shake me

Now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
All the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

Well, she said, ""It's cold outside"" and she hands me my raincoat
She's always worried 'bout things like that
Well, she said, ""It's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault""

And she only sleeps when it's rainin'
And she screams and her voice is strainin'

Well, she believes that life isn't made up of all that you're used to
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway, yeah
But outside, it's stopped rainin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, but she says, ""Baby
Well, it's 3 AM, I must be lonely""
Yeah, when she says, ""Baby,"" ah yeah, yeah
""Well, I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this
Well, it's 3 AM, I must be lonely"" (I must be lonely)

Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me

12155,Over You,Daughtry,"[Verse 1]
Now that it's all said and done
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up, then tear me down
Like an old abandoned house
And what you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath
I fell too far, was in way too deep
Guess I let you get the best of me

[Chorus]
Well, I never saw it coming
I shoulda started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally getting better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you

[Verse 2]
You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags and walked away
There was nothing I could say
And when you slammed the front door shut
A lot of others opened up
So did my eyes so I could see
That you never were the best for me

Well, I never saw it coming
I shoulda started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you

(Oh no)

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She was sitting at the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

[Break]
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by, you've been struck by a smooth criminal

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, but a black day
I could make a salutation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by, you've been struck by a smooth criminal

Annie, are you okay (oh no)
Will you tell us that you're okay (oh no)

He came into your apartment (oh no)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet (oh no)
And then you ran into the bedroom (oh no)
You were struck down
It was your doom

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
It's not sane

You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it made)

Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me

Life's gotta always be messin' with me (You wanna see the light)

12179,Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,"[Verse 1]
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

[Pre-Chorus]
You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonderland (I'll use my hands)

So send the pain below, where I need it
You used to beg me to take care of things
And smile at the thought of me failing
But long before having hurt
I'd send the pain below

How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?

I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?

Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more

To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting…

While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?

From others who care for themselves
A blindness that touches perfection
But hurts just like anything else

These things I could never describe

To the centre of the city where all roads meet
Waiting for you
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank
Searching for you
I was moving through the silence without motion
Waiting for you
In a room with a window in the corner
I found truth

[Verse 2]
In the shadowplay, acting out your own death
Knowing no more
As the assassins all grouped in four lines
Dancing on the floor
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies
Made a move to connect
But I could only stare in disbelief
As the crowds all left

[Outro]
I did everything, everything I wanted to
I let them use you for their own ends
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you

And furthermore, Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that all four of them habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes... Reefers

I smoke two joints in the morning
I smoke two joints at night
I smoke two joints in the afternoon, it makes me feel alright
I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of war
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more

Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!

Abandoned too soon, set down with due care

12228,Ghost,Motorama,"[Verse 1]
My hopes, my will
Were never a part of you
Those days were sad and cold
I'll never want them back again

[Chorus]
But in this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillow

[Verse 2]
Your voice is pure and soft
It's throwing me back to my hopes
My ears were deaf and cold
Please hold me tight in your arms again

[Chorus]
But in this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillow

[Chorus]
But in this moment we are close to each other again

12212,Take Care of You,Cherokee,"[Intro:]
Damn!
What's this, baby?
I thought this was a summer thing
Me and you? You and me?
You messin' up my stroll!
Don't you know they call me Miss Cherry?

[Verse 1:]
It started in June
Just when I thought that I had washed my hands
Gave up on love
Then here you come and now here's where you stand
Yo, where the fuck you come from, babe?
And who said I needed a man?
This supposed to be my time to be alone
But I'm with you instead

[Chorus:]
I swear you better treat me right, love me good
Never break my heart
Oh, baby, I swear
I swear, darling, if you do I'll hurt you bad
Tear your world apart
Oh, baby, I swear
I swear you better treat me right, love me good
Never break my heart
Oh, baby, I swear
I swear, darling, if you do I'll hurt you bad
Tear your world apart
Oh, baby, I swear

[Verse 2:]
Was having the time of my prime
My little black book was starting to glow
But there you go saying how you love me so
Done interrupted my pimp flow!
And I've contradicted everything I ever said
About falling in love again
Oh, baby, it's a threat I see, tell you honestly
That you better make sure you take good care of me

I swear, darlin'
Ooh, I swear, oh...

Say it to me
Love me all night

Hoo...hoo...hoo...hoo..

And since we're here, you better treat me right

Said it now, since we're here, you better take good care of me

Forever alone, forever alone

She scares them all
She’s far too pretty
For that dancing hall

It shook the stage
A cannonball
Dave almost fell
But she took the fall

For him
For him

Ann wants to dance
I do recall
Her freckled face
Glowing down the hall

Between her legs
A waterfall
Ann wants to yell
She can only moan

For him
For him

Ann wants to dance
She scares them all
She’s far too pretty
For that dancing hall

It shook the stage
A cannonball
Dave almost fell
But she took the fall

For him
For him

12225,Different State of Mind,Kid Bloom,"Sinking right into the crimson clouds
Waiting for this thing to spin me out
I'm swimming in my head
Mouth so dry, I could crack my tongue
Jaw hanging like an accordion
Let's hope nobody stares

It was a different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind

Give me a reason and I will hold your
Strawberry-flavored lightning bolt
Like everybody else
I can't reach the counter, but I feel tall
You're standing naked in your overalls, tonight
I'm someone else

It was a different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind

She knows what I bring
She tells me to say it
She knows what I bring
And that's where I'll find

A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind

Ah, it was a different state of mind
It was a different state of mind

J'attendrai là
En bas de chez toi
Jusqu'à ce qu'on voit le monde

I've been thinking about you, my love
And all the crazy things that you put me through
Now I'm coming around, throwing it back to you
Were you thinking of me when you kissed him?
Could you taste me when you licked his skin?
All the while I showered you with trust and promises

What I'm needing now is some sweet revenge
To get back all that I lost then
I gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you

Adrienne, I should have left you
Long before you used me, used me up

But in my sky all burnt out you are
And I'll have the last laugh
When I see you walking with some other guy
'Cause I know you're gonna end up all alone

So take these words, some good advice
All you've done's gonna come back twice
You never cared how much it hurt, I really need to tell you

12210,Wrong Way,Sublime,"[Verse 1]
Annie's twelve years old, in two more, she'll be a whore
Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way
Don't be afraid with the quickness you get laid
For your family, get paid, it's the wrong way

[Hook 1]
I gave her all that I had to give
I'm gonna make it hard to live
Salty tears running down to her chin
And it ruins up her makeup and never wan' give

[Verse 2]
A cigarette pressed between her lips
But I'm staring at her tits, it's the wrong way
Strong if I can, but I am only a man
So I take her to the can, it's the wrong way

[Hook 2]
The only family that she's ever had
Is her seven horny brothers and a drunk-ass dad
He needed money, so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine, until the day she met me

[Verse 3]
Happy are you sad, wanna shoot your dad?
I'll do anything I can, the wrong way
We talk all night, tried to make it right
Believe me, shit was tight, it was the wrong way

[Hook 3]
Don't run away, if you wanna stay
'Cause I ain't here to make you, oh, no
It's up to you what you really want to do
Spend some time in America
Dub style!

[Trombone Solo]

[Hook 1]
She'll give you all that she's got to give
But I'm gonna make it hard to live
Big, salty tears rolling down to her chin
And it smears up her makeup an' never wan' give

[Verse 4]
So, we ran away and I'm sorry when I say
That straight to this very day it was the wrong way
She did the hike, don't matter if I like it, or not
Because she only wants the wrong way

[Hook 4]
I gave her all that I had to give
She still wouldn't take it, whoa, no
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve
And it still ruins her makeup, and never wan' give

12243,Leave Me Alone,New Order,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
On a thousand islands in the sea
I see a thousand people just like me
A hundred unions in the snow
I watch them walking, falling in a row
We live always underground
It's going to be so quiet in here tonight
There's a thousand islands in the sea
It's a shame

[Verse 2]
And a hundred years ago
A sailor trod this ground I stood upon
Take me away everyone
When it hurts thou

[Chorus 1]
From my head to my toes
From the words in the book
I see a vision that would bring me luck
From my head to my toes
To my teeth, through my nose
You get these words wrong
You get these words wrong
Every time
You get these words wrong
I just smile

[Chorus 2]
But from my head to my toes
From my knees to my eyes
Every time I watch the sky
For these last few days leave me alone
But for these last few days leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

My promise could be your fiend
A given end to your dreams
A simple movement or rhyme
Could be the smallest of signs
We'll never know what they are or care
In its escapable view
There's no escape, so few in fear
Give in a changing value

[Verse 2]
To be given your sight
Hid in a long peaceful night
A nervous bride for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A love that's wrong from your life and soul
A savage mine had begun
A long farewell to your love and soul
A long farewell to your soul

[Chorus]
Now I know what those hands would do
No looking back now, we're pushing through
We'll change these feelings, we'll taste, we'll see
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream

Yeah, Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart

There's too many kings
Wanna hold you down
And a world at the window
Gone underground

There's a hole in the sky
Where the sun don't shine
And a clock on the wall
And it counts my time

And Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart

[Guitar solo]

There's a song on the air
With a 'love you' line
And a face in a glass
And it looks like mine

And I'm standing on ice when I say
That I don't hear planes
And I scream at the fools
Wanna jump my train

And Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart

Yeah, Heaven
Ah, Heaven
Yeah, Heaven

Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your— Hey, oh
Now listen what I say, oh
(Oh)

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
Come back and— Hey, oh
Look at what I say, oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, oh! Whoa-whoa

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
Ho!

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

Take my hand, and I'll take it for a ride
You hit me yesterday, because I made you cry
So before we die, I'd like to do something nice

I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money

I want to buy you something

Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you know
You know, you know

12205,Here Without You,3 Doors Down,"[Verse 1]
A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

[Chorus]
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

[Verse 2]
The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby

And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah

Everything I know, and anywhere I go (Yeah)
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

12203,Snuff,Slipknot,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

[Chorus 1]
So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

[Verse 2]
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

[Chorus 2]
So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

[Guitar solo]

Oh, oh

[Chorus 3]
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know

"
12232,Disorder,Joy Division,"[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
Lose sensation, spare the insults, leave them for another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away

[Verse 2]
It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, into no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow

[Verse 3]
What means to you, what means to me and we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from your friends
Who is right, who can tell and who gives a damn right now?
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know

[Outro]
I've got the spirit
But lose the feeling
I've got the spirit
But lose the feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling

She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar, lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight

It's a fashion with a gun, my love
In a room without a door
A kiss is not enough

[Chorus]
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

[Verse 2]
They'd put us on a railroad
They'd dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces and making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes
There's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all and take us all apart, but not

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes
Love my way, it's a new road

Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me around
I feel numb, born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it, the better
We'll make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground, head in the sky
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing

[Chorus 1]
Hi-yeah, I got plenty of time
Hi-yeah, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money, always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

[Verse 2]
Home is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from another
Did I find you or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be

[Chorus 2]
Hi-yeah, we drift in and out
Hi-yeah, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home and
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me 'til my heart stops
Love me 'til I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head, I go
Ooh

Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, ""It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care""

Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, ""Return the ring""
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

Need special handling

Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

[Verse 3]
Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again

12295,April Skies,The Jesus and Mary Chain,"[Verse 1]
Hey, honey, what you trying to say?
As I stand here, don't you walk away
And the world comes tumbling down
Hand in hand in a violent life
Making love on the edge of a knife
And the world comes tumbling down

[Chorus 1]
And it's hard for me to say
And it's hard for me to stay
I'm going down to be by myself
I'm going back for the good of my health
And there's one thing I couldn't do
Sacrifice myself to you
Sacrifice

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, I just can't see
Just what you mean to me
I take my aim and I fake my words
I'm just your longtime curse
And if you walk away
I can't take it

[Chorus 2]
But that's the way that you are
And that's the things that you say
But now you've gone too far
With all the things you say
Get back to where you come from
I can't help it, under the April skies
Under the April skies
Under the April sun
Under the April skies

[Bridge]
Under the April sun
Under the April sun
Under the April skies
Under the April sun

The sun grows cold, the sky gets black
And you broke me up and now you won't come back
Shaking hand, life is dead
And a broken heart and a screaming head
Hey, hey

Into someone else's pocket, then make a slip

Ooh, the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down
Oh-oh-oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you and you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once so alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise

For making us part

When I'm away from home
When I step out the door
The jungle is alive
I do not trust my ears
I don't believe my eyes

I will not fall in love
I cannot risk the bet
'Cause hearts are fragile toys
So easy to forget

It drags me when I walk
I smell it everywhere
It's just another day
Where people cling to light
To drive away the fear
That comes with every night

The world was set on fire
And everywhere I ran
There wasn't any water
The temperature increased
The sky was crimson red
The clouds turned into smoke
And everyone was dead

(But) There's a smile on my face...
For everyone
There's a golden coin...
That reflects the sun
There's a lonely place...
That's always cold
There's a place in the stars...
For when you get old

Oooh
Oh, oh,…
Ahhhh

There's razors in my bed
That come out late at night
They always disappear
Before the morning light
I'm dreaming again
Of life underground
It doesn't ever move
It doesn't make a sound

And just when I think
That things are in their place
The heavens are secure
The whole thing explodes in my face

There's a lonely place... (It's just another day)

But you know, I would hate anything
To happen to her
No, I don't want to see her

Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
My, my, my, my, my
My baby, goodbye

There were times
When I could have strangled her
But you know, I would hate anything
To happen to her
Would you please let me see her?

Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do

Let me whisper my last goodbyes
I know, it's serious

12261,A Question of Lust,Depeche Mode,"[Verse 1]
Fragile, like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me, I'd never willingly do you harm
Apologies are all you seem to get from me
But just like a child, you make me smile when you care for me
And you know

[Chorus]
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

[Verse 2]
Independence is still important for us though
(We realise)
It's easy to make the stupid mistake of letting go
(Do you know what I mean?)
My weaknesses, you know each and every one
(It frightens me)
But I need to drink more than you seem to think before I'm anyone's
And you know

[Chorus]
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

[Bridge]
Kiss me goodbye when I'm on my own
But you know that I'd rather be home

[Chorus]
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

12270,Cities In Dust,Siouxsie and the Banshees,"[Verse 1]
Water was running, children were running
You were running out of time
Under the mountain, a golden fountain
Were you praying at the Lares shrine?

[Chorus]
But, oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

We found you hiding, we found you lying
Choking on the dirt and sand
Your former glories, and all the stories
Dragged and washed with eager hands

Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Your city lies in dust

Hot and burning in your nostrils
Pouring down your gaping mouth
Your molten bodies, blanket of cinders
Caught in the throes, and

Woah oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh-uh-oh, oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

Electric blue for me
Never more to be free

Carbon fuels from the sea
Wasted electricity

A gift for man to throw away
The chance to change has nearly gone
The alternative is only one
The final source of energy

Save your breath

Just close your eyes
I was so impressed by you
I was running blind
I would fall for every trick
Every twist of mind

Don't say your prayers, don't build your hopes

I know it's out of fashion
And a trifle uncool
But I can't help it
I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine
To watch the sun go down
On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down

[Chorus]
From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday

On a silent summer evening
The sky's alive with lights
A building in the distance
Surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach
Waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach
There's not a soul around

From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday

It's filling me up with new life
The stars in the sky bring tears to my eyes
They're lighting my way tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And I haven't felt so alive
In years

Just for a day on a day like today
I'll get away from this constant debauchery
The wind in my hair makes me so aware
How good it is to live tonight

The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
But they're not like tonight

My pleasure at being so wet
Here on my own, all on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight

The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
When my eyes had been so red
I'd been mistaken for dead
But not tonight

12272,Head Over Heels,Tears For Fears,"[Verse 1: Roland Orzabal]
I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time

[Chorus: Roland Orzabal]
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

[Post-Chorus: Roland Orzabal]
Throw it away
Throw it away

[Verse 2: Roland Orzabal & Curt Smith]
I made a fire and watching it burn
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past, now just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?
My mother and my brother's used to breathing clean air
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
And dreaming I'm a doctor
Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby
It’s hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age
Oh, I feel so

[Chorus: Roland Orzabal]
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

I’m on the line, one open mind

12275,Pictures Of You,The Cure,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

[Verse 3]
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

[Verse 4]
Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

[Verse 5]
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels, so much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 6]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
And always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you

12285,Are 'Friends' Electric?,Tubeway Army,"[Verse 1]
It's cold outside
And the paint's peeling off of my walls
There's a man outside
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette

[Verse 2]
Now the light fades out
And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this
There's a knock on the door
And just for a second, I thought I remembered you

[Chorus]
So now I'm alone
Now I can think for myself
About little deals and S.U's
And things that I just don't understand
Like a white lie at night
Or a sly touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you

[Verse 3]
So I open the door
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway
""Please sit down""
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed

[Verse 4]
You know I hate to ask
But are 'friends' electric?
Only mine's broke down
And now I've no one to love

[Chorus]
So I found out your reasons for the phone calls and smiles
And it hurts and I'm lonely
And I should never have tried
And I missed you tonight
So it's time to leave
You see, it meant everything to me

12276,Strangelove,Depeche Mode,"[Verse 1]
There'll be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough from your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

[Chorus]
Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?

[Post-Chorus]
Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again and will you return it?

[Verse 2]
There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach
Oh, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

[Bridge]
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I won't say it again

It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth

I tried to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies

And beg forgiveness, plead with you
But I know that it's too late

So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it

I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
And you've already gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I can't believe the things you say
They echo what I fear
Twisting the bones until they snap
I scream but no one knows
You say I'm familiar, cold to touch
And then you turn and go

[Chorus]
Feels like Heaven
Feels like Heaven

[Verse 2]
See how we planned for saddened eyes
And tears to pave the way
I fought the fever as I knew
My hair returned to gray
Study your face and fade the frame
Too close for comfort now
We can recall the harmony
That lingered but turned sour

[Chorus]
Feels like Heaven
Feels like Heaven

12269,Mad World,Tears For Fears,"[Verse 1]
All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, 'cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world

[Verse 2]
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

[Chorus]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, 'cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles, it's a very very
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad

12300,Lucretia My Reflection,Sisters of Mercy,"I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down...
I hear empire down...

I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Love lost, fire at will
Dum-dum bullets and shoot to kill, I hear
Dive, bombers, and
Empire down...
Empire down...

I hear the sons of the city and dispossessed
Get down, get undressed
Get pretty but you and me
We got the kingdom, we got the key
We got the empire, now as then
We don't doubt, we don't take direction
Lucretia, my reflection, dance the ghost with me...

We look hard
We look through
We look hard
To see for real
Such things I hear, they don't make sense
I don't see much evidence
I don't feel
I don't feel
I don't feel

A long train held up by page on page
A hard reign held up by rage
Once a railroad
Now it's done...

I hear the roar of the big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down...

We got the empire, now as then
We don't doubt, we don't take reflection
Lucretia, my direction, dance the ghost with me...

12340,Romeo And Juliet,Dire Straits,"[Verse 1]
A lovestruck Romeo sings a streetsuss serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, ""You and me babe, how about it?""
Juliet says, ""Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gimme a heart attack""
He's underneath the window
She's singing, ""Hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?""

[Chorus 1]
""Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, when you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget
The movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet""

[Bridge]
Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?

[Verse 2]
Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything
You promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, ""Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him""

[Chorus 2]
""Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us
(You know the movie song)
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet""

[Verse 3]
""I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and the bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time""

[Chorus 2]
""Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die

12323,Have A Nice Day,Bon Jovi,"[Verse 1]
Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away

[Chorus]
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

[Verse 2]
Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?

[Chorus]
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

Goddamn you half-Japanese girls
Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of public enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me

I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them (How cool is that?)
How cool is that? So I went to your room
And read your diary
""Watching Grunge leg drop New Jack through a press table""
And then my heart stopped, ""Listening to Cio-Cio San
Fall in love all over again"" (Ow)

How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute?
Just come up to me and say hello to my heart
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say
""I'm falling for you""

[Verse 3]
I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes
Without shaking and I ain't faking
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon

[Chorus]
I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting (Waiting, oh)
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me (Oh-hoo)

And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert

Oh yeah, yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah

[Verse 3]
Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

Oh, yeah, the boy can play
The dedication, devotion
Turning all the nighttime into the day

Mmm, they do the walk of life

I can't get there on my own
You can't leave me here alone
I’m just trying to do what’s right
Oh a man ain't a man 'less he's fought the fight
I could never point you out
Waste of space in a faceless crowd
Tell me what I have to say
If you know what’s right, then you’ll walk away

When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

And the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

When the walls come down
When the walls come down

Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there’s nothing in the way

Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

12302,Happy When It Rains,The Jesus and Mary Chain,"[Verse 1]
Step back and watch the sweet thing
Breaking everything she sees
She can take my darkest feeling
Tear it up till I'm on my knees
Plug into her electric cool
Where things bend and break and shake to the rule
Talking fast couldn't tell me something
I would shed my skin for you
Talking fast on the edge of nothing
I would break my back for you
Don't know why, don't know why
Things vaporise and rise to the sky

[Chorus 1]
And we tried so hard
And we looked so good
And we lived our lives in black
But something about you felt like pain
You were my sunny day rain
You were the clouds in the sky
You were the darkest sky
But your lips spoke gold and honey
And that's why I'm happy when it rains
I'm happy when it pours

[Bridge]
Look at me enjoying something
That feels like, feels like pain
To my brain

[Verse 2]
And if I tell you something
You take me back to nothing
I'm on the edge of something
You take me back

And I'm happy when it rains

And I'm happy now

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

I know we said that we'd always be honest
So now I went out and messed up, our nest
It finally seems like we've turned into strangers
Its gotten so bad there's just no more anger
So now it seems like we can't get no further
I can't believe I'll be bright for another

Under the moon and with the girl that's in your place
And even Edison has no idea
Of all the blackouts I've caused you and me

Hold out your hand

This is the promised land?
With bright lights shining, it seems so right
Don't you know that
Things go nice with spice?

When the door broke open and let in
The light
So we ran to an empty space and felt so free
You know we’ve never felt like this
Before

Hold out your hand
Don't you know that
This is the promised land?
With bright lights shining, it seems so right
Don't you know that
Things go nice with spice?

Now I think the time has come to open the box
Let into the world what's been hidden
From inside
Not covering what the day brings, it seems so right
Don't you know that this is the promised land?
Alright

12316,Out The Window,Violent Femmes,"Life was fun
Life was great
Til I made my big mistake
Oh no it'll never happen to me
Life was short
And life was sweet
I was thinking as I hit the street
I could hardly believe
I could scarcely conceive
But I had gone out the window
I had gone out the window
I had gone out the window
She was fine
She looked great
And so we made our big mistake
I swear I swear I swear
It'd never happen to her
But the pavement knocked her head around
When she hit the solid concrete ground
From thirty flights above
And she was thirty something loving nothing
Gone out the window
She had gone out the window
She had gone out the window
Oh, catch me if I'm falling
Catch me if I'm calling
He was smart he was wise
He'd profoundly philosophize
Empathy for all humanity
'til one day by an open window
There's a note that read
I've gone out the window - I'm dead
He said yes to life for all of his life
But then one day he said no
I gotta go out the window
We all go out the window
Catch me i am falling
Catch me I am calling
Catch me we are falling
Catch me we are calling

Down on the corner of 14th and U
They took your soul and they took you for fools
Took all the windows from prisons and schools
Now, what's a poor man left to do?
One heart now broken in two
You start untyin' the hand of the youth
New kids hear the sound of the drummin'
Mother nature, your summer is coming
Yesterday and today
Revolution on its way

Amen, it was the feast and the famine
Amen, it was the feast and the famine
It was the feast and the famine

[Verse 2]
Crossroads with nothing to lose
Out of the basement and into the news
Come change, now shit gettin' heavy
Salvation at the ready
You look when I walked by
Still screamin', ""'Til I die!""
You can't find peace if you can't find a home
You can't survive as an island alone
Black heart with a gaping wound
Put back together by a troubled groove
Check yourself, wrack your brains
Where is that P.M.A.?

Amen, it was the feast and the famine
Amen, it was the feast and the famine

12325,Something from Nothing,Foo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
Give me the flammable life
I'm cold as a match, ready to strike
So here I go
Here lies a city on fire
Singin' along, the arsonist choir
Now here I go
It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now here I go
There is a river I found
Into the wild, under the ground
So here I go
A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now here I go, well

[Bridge]
Oh, sweet ignition, be my fuse
You have no choice, you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye, I'm on my way
But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go, well
Oh, sweet ignition, be my fuse
You had no choice, you had to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye, I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry, I could lie
You took my word, I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Lookin' for a dime and found a quarter

[Chorus]
But you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now ain't that's something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
It goes oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It goes oh, oh, oh

Her placenta falls to the floor
The angel opens her eyes,  the confusion sets in
Before the doctor can even close the door

Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes, the confusion that was hers

Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again

The angel opens her eyes, pale blue colored iris
Presents the circle, puts the glory out to hide, hide

Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Gettin' good at startin' over
Every time that I return

Where do I begin?
Learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?

Do you remember the days
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn?
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growin' stronger?
Little conquerors

I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learnin' to talk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?

Now
For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free, again
To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside, a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice, but knowin' to survive
The first to climb another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die
I never wanna die, I never wanna die!
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die!
I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die!
I never wanna leave, I'll never say goodbye!
Forever! Whenever! Forever! Whenever!

Learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

Sometimes, when this place gets kind of empty
Sound of their breath fades with the light
I think about the loveless fascination

Lower the curtain down on Memphis
Lower the curtain down, all right
I got no time for private consultation
Under the Milky Way tonight

Something shimmering and white
It leads you here, despite your destination
Under the Milky Way tonight

Might have known what you would find

It's not a case of doing what's right

Tell me I'm wrong, I don't really care
It's not a case of share and share alike
I take what I require
I don't understand, you say it's not fair

[Chorus]
You expect me to act like a lover
Consider my moves and deserve the reward
To hold you in my arms and wait, and wait
And wait for something to happen

It's not a case of telling the truth
Some lines just fit the situation
You call me a liar, you would anyway
It's not a case of aiming to please
You know you're always crying
It's just your part in the play for today

They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

[Outro]
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench (Fall in, fall out)
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench (Fall in, fall out)
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench (Fall in, fall out)
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
"
12343,Adam's Song,blink-182,"[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone

12344,Drive,Incubus,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel the fear of
Uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh

[Verse 2]
So if I decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Ohh-oh-ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that
When I drive myself my light is found

[Chorus]
And whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Would you choose the water over wine
Hold the wheel and drive?

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there

That's enough for excitements today
Prostrated faded, it's pay-to-play

Come and see me, yeah, maybe you'll try
I've been holding these pyros til they could fly

12352,When I Come Around,Green Day,"[Verse 1]
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you been thinking about ditching me

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

[Verse 2]
Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around

When I come around

12350,I Want You,Kings of Leon,"[Verse 1]
Get back on track, pick me up some bottles of booze
Fickle freshman, probably thinks she's cooler than you
A hay ride at 5, everybody's coming around
So go press your skirt, word is there's a new girl in town
I call shotgun, you can play your R&B tunes
The fellowship time, it always comes a little too soon
The land of the creeps, freshened up from baby-faced shave
Put your eyes on me and I know a place where we can get away

[Chorus]
Just say, I want you
Just 'xactly like I used to
'Cause baby, this is only bringing me down

[Verse 2]
Homeboy's so proud, he finally got the video proof
The night vision shows she was only ducking the truth
It's heavy, I know, the black cat with the gift down below
A choke and a gag, she spit up and came back for more

[Chorus]
She said, I want you
Just 'xactly like I used to
And baby, this is only bringing me down
She said, I want you

And I've made hallways scenes for things to regret
My friends they come
And the lines they go by

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

I live my life filled with no pain
Just some rage and three kinds of yes

What are we gonna do?

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky

12355,Butterfly,Weezer,"[Verse 1]
Yesterday, I went outside
With my mama's mason jar
Caught a lovely butterfly
When I woke up today
Looked in on my fairy pet
She had withered all away
No more sighing in her breast

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away

[Verse 2]
Smell you on my hand for days
I can't wash away your scent
If I'm a dog, then you're a bitch
I guess you're as real as me
Maybe I can live with that
Maybe I need fantasy
Life of chasing butterfly

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away

When the robin makes his nest
But I ain't never coming back

Claim-making that nothing else will change

You go stabbing yourself in the neck
But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this place again
And you go stabbing yourself in the neck

[Bridge]
It's in the way that she posed
It's in the things that she puts in my head
Her stories are boring and stuff
She's always calling my bluff
She puts the, she puts the weights into my little heart
And she gets in my room and she takes it apart
She puts the weights into my little heart
I said she puts the weights into my little heart

She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away

It's in the way that she walks
Her heaven is never enough

It's a dead Russian, the papers say
But it would be nice if they realised
That she thought 'he is mine'

This town has got you down and I know
I was helping you out
While your hope died under northern skies and it shows
I was helping you to realise
The reason why, it was no surprise
No way

The act will pass by no-one
And I'm sad to say it's no different today
Be comforted by we share the same skies
And for once pay no mind

I have decided it's best that you know
I'm still thinking about
Old lies as north-west skies grow cold
No point in denying
Anxiety was my favourite feeling after jealousy
Yeah, I'll concede

That I could not
Be as nervous as I was
I could not
No way

This town has got you down and I know
I was helping you out
While your hope died under northern skies
And it shows
I was helping you to realise
The reason why, it was no surprise
No way

Playing ping pong over oceans, messing with emotions
Messing with my head

And I don't care what you say
To get me out of the way
I got to get my message through to you

Baby,baby,baby,baby,baby,baby,baby

Fast times in Tahoe
Playing in the Snow
Who oh oh oh
Fast times in Tahoe
Playing in the Snow
Who oh oh oh

They say, makes the, grow , but I, I really , playing, over
Messing with
Messing with

Fast times in Tahoe
Playing in the Snow

12370,Plastic Machinery,The Charlatans,"I too feel the plastic machinery
I know it's hard to be accepted
Our life is just like a dream to me
At times it's good to be rejected

So, let's just run
Even if
Only in our heads
Leave all of this behind
Unless we could stand still

It's not that we have no interest
It's not that we don't think it's worth it
Oh wait I am such an idiot
My shoulders find this hard to take it

You can tell me, tonight
If not this time
Your thoughts don't need
Don't need to be confined

I feel it too
This broken world
There is no second chance
Our flags unfold

Don't be part of the machinery
I know it's hard to be accepted
Our life is just like a dream to me
At times it's good to be rejected

So, let's just run
Even if
Only in our heads
Leave all of this behind
Unless we could stand still

On this machine still working in our heads
On this machine still working in our heads

Rosemary
Heaven restores you in life
You're coming with me
Through the aging, the fearing, the strife
It's the smiling on the package
It's the faces in the sand
It's the thought that moves you upwards
Embracing me with two hands
Right will take you places
Yeah, maybe to the beach
When your friends, they do come crying
Tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

It took a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?

[Verse 2]
He speaks about travel
Yeah, we think about the land
We smart like all peoples
Feeling real tan
I could take you places
Do you need a new man?
Wipe the pollen from the faces
Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

[Chorus]
It took a life span with no cell mate
By the long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, you are exotic
You need something for which to care
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?

[Verse 3]
Leave some shards under the belly
Lay some grease inside my hand
It's a sentimental jury
And the makings of a good plan
You've come to love me lightly
Yeah, you come to hold me tight
Is this motion everlasting
Or do shudders pass in the night?
Rosemary
Oh, heaven restores you in life

[Chorus]
I spent a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, semi-erotic
You need someone to take you there
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
Why can't we just play the other game?
Why can't we just look the other way?

You sat down i moved over
Pretty people but all I saw was you

I know what you're thinkin'
We were goin' down
I can feel the sinkin'
But then I came around
And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothin' mattered anymore
I looked into the sky

And I wanted somethin' beautiful
I wish for somethin' true
Been lookin' for a reason, man
Somethin' to lose

Broken hearts will mend

12373,There Are Too Many Of Us,Blur,"[Verse 1]
There are too many of us
That's plain to see
We all believe in praying
For our immortality
We've posed these questions to our children
That calls them all to stray
And live in tiny houses
Of the same mistakes we made

[Chorus]
'Cause there are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
Passing out of somewhere
But you won't care

[Verse 2]
There are too many of us
That's plain to see
And we all believe in praying
For our own immortality
For a moment, I was dislocated
My terror on a loop elsewhere
The flashing lights part vacated
On the big screens everywhere

[Chorus]
'Cause there are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
Just passing out of somewhere
But you won't care

There are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
All looking through the windows
On everything we share

Strolling through the opening scene
Where’d you want it? It’s your decision, honey
My planet or yours? Sectoral heterochromia

Aviation in the evening, I can feel it coming on
Mama told me, you should start as you mean to go wrong
Or else you’re never gonna get it right

[Verse 2: Miles Kane]
Señorita, well you need not come coke-head close to me
'Cause I can hear you perfectly clear from here

[Chorus: Miles Kane & Alex Turner]
Aviation in the evening, I can feel it coming on
Mama told me, you should start as you mean to go wrong
Or else you’re never gonna get it right

Aviation in the evening, I just can’t leave it alone
I reckon I just might have broke the ice

December's tragic drive
When time is poetry

And brave songs disappear
To the secret voice of dawn
This last time raise my eyes

The mirrors lie, those aren't my eyes
Destroy them, raise my hand
Reflected in savage shards
A new face, a soul reborn

By your friends from New York and London

A man's needs, man's needs
Are lost on me

Are found on greed, are found on greed

I'm not bothered, what you say or how you dress
I'm a mess, so you've always seemed inviting
But really, this all seems quite meaningless
And I remember that you never seem to see...

The fact that man's needs, man's needs
Are found on greed, are found on greed

Are lost on me

She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a drivin' ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and starin' at the ground

What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feelin' in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

Isn't he Mr. Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say owt

Pullin' in and givin' her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezin'
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
It don't stop in the winter, no

In the dust of the deed of time

It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone

You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game

A stupid mission and a lethal fight
I should've seen it when my hope was new

Libraries gave us power
Then work came and made us free
What price now
For a shallow piece of dignity

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a bottle
Right here in my dirty face
To wear the scars
To show from where I came

[Chorus]
We don't talk about love
We only want to get drunk
And we are not allowed to spend
As we are told that this is the end
A design for life
A design for life
A design for life
A design for life

I wish I had a bottle
Right here in my pretty face
To wear the scars
To show from where I came

We only want to get drunk
And we are not allowed to spend
As we are told that this is the end
A design for life

How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were gettin' high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were gettin' high?

Someday you will find me caught beneath the landslide

A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye

One, take control of me?
You're messing with the enemy
Said it's two, it's another trick
Messing with my mind, I wake up
Chase down an empty street
Blindly snap the broken beats
Said it's gone, with the dirty trick
It's taken all these days to find ya

All these pills got to operate
The colour quits and all invade us
There it goes again
Take me to the edge again
All I got, is a dirty trick

Outside the frame is what we're leaving out

It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
Something sweet to throw away
I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live
I want a new mistake
Lose is more than hesitate
Do you believe it in your head?

I can go with the flow
Don't say it doesn't matter (With the flow)

Itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles
Organise your safe tribal war
Hurt, maim, kill, and enslave the ghetto
Each day living out a lie
Life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever

Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness

Orthodox dreams and symbolic myths
From feudal serf to spender
This wonderful world of purchase power
Just like lungs sucking on air
Survival's natural as sorrow, sorrow, sorrow

Under neon loneliness

Living life like a comatose
Ego, loaded and swallow, swallow, swallow

Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness
Everlasting nothingness

Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh, oh, oh
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say ""oh""
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say ""oh""

His Honor drove southward, seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh, oh
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say ""oh""

I sat by the ocean
And drank a potion, baby, to erase you
Face down in the boulevard, yet I couldn't face you

It doesn't change anything, so, baby, what good does it do?
Your friends, they all sympathize, maybe I don't need them to

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead, I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie

There's nowhere to run away
Said, ""Boy, if you want love, you'll have to go and find it with someone new
Do you know who you really are, are you sure it's really you?""
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night
Into the light, left with nowhere to hide

Closer and closer, we're crashing ships in the night

So we're different colours and we're different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me, though I've done nothing wrong

What makes a man
Hate another man

12444,Lessons In Love,Level 42,"[Verse 1]
I'm not proud, I was wrong
And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

[Chorus 1]
All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

[Verse 2]
For restless eyes, egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard
Heavy hearts, token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

[Chorus 2]
All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
Lessons in love

[Bridge]
Lost without love
Lessons in love
When will you ever learn
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn
Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait 'till you return

All the dreams that we were building
We never lived them
We could use it, we should use it, yeah (Lessons in love)

Could be better, should be better

12409,Do I Wanna Know?,Arctic Monkeys,"[Verse 1]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

Let me love and steal
I have danced inside your eyes
How can I be real?

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?

Choose my colour, find a star
Precious people always tell me
That's a step, a step too far

Do you really want to make me cry?

Wrapped in sorrow, words are token
Come inside and catch my tears
You've been talking, but believe me
If it's true, you do not know
This boy loves without a reason
I'm prepared to let you go

If it's love you want from me
Then take it away
Everything's not what you see
It's over again

But with building bricks of trust and love
Mountains can be moved

Love come, down upon us 'til you flow like water
Burning, with the hope of insight
Feathered, look they're covered with a bright elation
Stolen, in the sight of love

We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

Birds fly, in the eye of the faithless daughter
Broken, at the bitter end
Wasted, sacrifice for a new nirvana
Night time, sends us on our way

We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

I've been looking for a way
For to long now
Seems like everything
Must come to an end

[Chorus]
Now I don't want to see you anymore
Don't want to be the one to play your game
Not even if you smile your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me, darling, please
Now I don't want to see you anymore
Don't want to be the one to play your game
Not even if you smile your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me, darling, please

[Bridge]
Time after time
Nothing that I can do
Knowing your ways
And loving your ways
But not getting through at all
Day after day
Leaving the past behind
Coming to terms
With stitches and burns
And learning to fly again

[Chorus]
Now I don't want to see you anymore
Don't want to be the one to play your game
Not even if you smile your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me, darling, please
Now I don't want to see you anymore
Don't want to be the one to play your game
Not even if you smile your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me, darling, please

12414,The Ghost in You,The Psychedelic Furs,"[Verse 1]
A man in my shoes runs a light
And all the papers lied tonight
But falling over you
Is the news of the day
Angels fall like rain
And love, love, love, love is all of heaven away (Love, love, love)

[Chorus]
Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)
Inside you the time moves (It's coming down)
And she don't fade (To losing it in you)

[Verse 2]
A race is on, I'm on your side
And hearing you, my engines die
I'm in a mood for you
For running away
Stars come down in you
And love, love, love, you can't give it away (Love, love, love, love)

[Chorus]
Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)
Inside you the time moves (It's coming down)
And she don't fade (To losing it in you)

[Bridge]
Don't you go
It makes no sense
When all your talking supermen
Just take away the time
And get in the way
Ain't it just like rain?
And love, love, love, love is only heaven away (Love, love, love, love)

[Chorus]
Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)

[Chorus]
Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)

And she don't fade (In you and I)

One way or the other
Nobody wins without once giving in
So don't cry now
Don't cry now""

Love is just a game you play in high school
Girls know how to be cruel
Most of the time, girls are cruel to be kind
So don't cry now
Ooh, don't cry now

And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day, making love to a paper moon

And she said
""Boys do fall in love
They make time
They get love on a Saturday night""
And she said
""Hearts beat as they dance in the street to a radio
Oh, oh, oh
B-b-b-boys fall in love""

Baby knows I like to get excited
No one wants to fight it
It's getting late, so I'll just demonstrate
Don't cry now
Ooh, don't cry now

And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day, making love to a paper moon

And she said

12427,Head Over Heels,The Go-Go's,"[Verse 1]
Been running so long
I've nearly lost all track of time
In every direction
I couldn't see the warning signs
I must be losin' it
'Cause my mind plays tricks on me
It looked so easy
But you know, looks sometimes deceive
Been running so fast
Right from the starting line
No more connections
I don't need any more advice
One hand's just reaching out
And one's just hangin' on
It seems my weaknesses
Just keep going strong

[Chorus]
Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync

[Verse 2]
Been running so hard
When what I need is to unwind
The voice of reason
Is one I left so far behind
I've waited so long
So long to play this part
And just remembered
That I'd forgotten about my heart

[Chorus]
Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync

Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync
Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync

12421,State Of The Nation,Industry,"[Verse 1]
I see them marching off to war
They're looking so heroic
I'm told they won't be gone for long
But that's a lie and they know it
Ten thousand gone they won't return
Never to be seen again
Strategic games is all we learn in the end
But they say

[Chorus]
Don't you worry about the situation
A message from the telephone
They out there fighting for the state of the nation
I'm waiting a chance to come home
They always have to fight the alienation
And realize I'm fighting alone

[Verse 2]
When nightmares memories fades to dust
We'll get back on our feet again
This war has nothing to do with us
But somehow we're still involved in it

[Chorus]
Well, don't you worry about the situation
A message from the telephone
They out there fighting for the state of the nation
I'm waiting a chance to come home
Well, don't you worry about the situation

They always have to fight the alienation
And realize I'm fighting alone

12431,Burning Flame,Vitamin Z,"Walking out tonight in the street lights I can see you
Arm in arm with just another guy
You look at me and wave hello-how friendly
I look at you and the cars go passing by

I understand that you used to love me
Nothing much but it made you cry
So here we are making pleasant gestures
And I just can't see the reason why

Me and you we never made it far girl
Now I laugh at the promises we made
And something went the first time that I hurt you
The lights went out and the memories start to fade

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

I felt the earth fall apart and crumble
All my dreams down they fell
And would an angel show mercy to the devil
But you're under my skin and you know darn well

Walking out tonight in the street lights I can see you
Arm in arm with just another guy
You look at me and wave hello-how friendly
I look at you and the cars go passing by

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when i first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

And all along on my trip to nowhere
You annoyed me with your foolish games
And how you teased when I first made love
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame
Burning flame, burning flame

There's no secrets kept in here
Forgive me for asking
Now wipe away your tears

And if I wish to stop it all
And if I wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking

I sat on the roof
And watched the day go by
I see the likeness in his smile and the way he stands
Makes it all worthwhile

And if I wish to stop it all
And if I wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking

It's time we should talk about it
There's no secrets kept in here

And I still can't sleep
Remembering my yesterdays
I begin to weep
If I could have it over

Of a boy I still resemble
But I no longer understand

Life was so good
I'd go back if I could

And here is a red balloon
I think of you, and let it go...

12471,Television / So Far So Good,Rex Orange County,"[Part I: Television]

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm not afraid, I can be myself and I
Hope you can be yourself as well, 'cause I can make you feel alright
And there was so much happiness that we were still yet to find
I said that you can call me Alex, baby, welcome to my life

[Bridge]
(But don't you worry, don't you, don't worry girl)
No, I'm not sure if I'm into you
The last time that you checked, I was probably so sad and confused
(I don't know, no, I don't know what you like)
But if you're looking for something new
I know somebody that you could choose

[Chorus]
What about me?
What about me?
What about me and you together?
Something that could really last forever
What about me?
What about me?
What about me and you together?
Something that could really last forever

[Verse 2]
If all my friends wanna be in her bed
And I begin to wonder why
I guess that I'd be lying to myself
'Cause who the fuck would be dumb enough
To reject an offer? Oh, what an offer
Now two-two-ten-one-five
Couple hours can change your life
Frankie saying ""Oh, what a night!""
What a night?
What the fuck is a girlfriend? I'ma need advice
Maybe I should go outside so I could get a fucking life
I made a friend and she spent the night, and now

[Bridge]
(I'm in love and she remains in my life)
Back when we spoke in Europe
I need insurance on my emotions
I can't get hurt again
(Fuck the past, fuck them, they all made me sad)
And I had no time to prepare to face my fears
I guess that it's time that I dried these tears

[Outro]
But if I could just be happy by the end of this song
But if by the time you hear it, you are already gone
And it didn't go to plan
Then why should I continue in this life
When there's no one around to be the one who makes me smile?

[Part II: So Far So Good]

[Verse]
But so far, everything's good (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-wow, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Said, so far, everything's good (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, no, no (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
No-no, no, no-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
I want the crowd in tears when they hear this
Is that so wrong?
"
12468,Reflections After Jane,The Clientele,"[Verse 1]
Butterflies with gilded wings this morning
Touched the red sun and the rain
On the bridge, the workers pass in threes and fours and fives
To my sleeplessness, reflections after Jane

[Verse 2]
How I long to live inside a window
By the sighing motorway
Feel the city searching for my loneliness
In all the dust and glass, reflections after Jane

[Bridge]
And I see her all on a golden Sunday
With her hair so dark in the rain

[Verse 3]
Who is in the newspapers this month or week or year?
My silent friend
I can starve my life into a deeper sleep
Remembering reflections after Jane
"
12454,Whirlpool Heart,The Wild Swans,"These are our humble days
We had a high ideal
But the family strays

Once, I thought the world was blue
Now it's raining colors
A paralyzing hue

I am never grieving
The wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

Come to a place I know, where the air is clean
And we're both alone
Maybe, we could capture there
Some of all we lost
In that nether world

I am never grieving
The wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

Days forever dreaming the wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

I am never grieving
The wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

Days forever dreaming the wicked things we've done
Let's walk into the whirlpool's heart
And die while we're still young

12451,Beauty and Madness,Fra Lippo Lippi,"[Verse 1]
Over there, just beneath the moon
There's a man with a burden to keep
Now, sleep will fall washout rags and paper bags
Homes and lives passing by

[Chorus]
Who will see the beauty in your life?
And who will be there to hear you when you call?
Who will see the madness in your life?
And who will be there to catch you if you fall?

[Verse 2]
Now dreams run wild, as lovers find their way
Through the night, not a care in the world
And over there, over the twinkling of the lights
Harbor lights, say goodnight one more time

[Chorus]
Who will see the beauty in you life?
And who will be there to hear you when you call?
Who will see the madness in your life?
And who will be there to catch you if you fall?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Who will see the beauty in you life?
And who will be there to hear you when you call?
Who will see the madness in your life?
And who will be there to catch you if you fall?
"
12489,Edition,Rex Orange County,"[Verse 1]
Baby you braved it
I understand you had a bad day and shit
So I say something dumb as fuck
And luckily it gives you a facelift
But really I couldn't take it
Especially when the volume is raising
(Like) she came in the room
Chicane in the road
Now my mind is racing
You care too
Where to?
Three days in a row my plans fell through
Crying in a hotel room
You listen
If I could I'd be staying at the Edition
(For real?)
For real
I would meet you at a certain time
And take my time to make my decision
For real

[Chorus]
I'm only ever trying to help you (love)
It's only ev​er love (in a hotel room)
It's only ever love, baby
I'm only ever trying to help you (love)
It's only ever love, baby (in a hotel room)
It's only ever love
It's only ever trying to be loved in a hotel room
"
12484,Social Sites,Cosmo Pyke,"[Verse 1]
There's nothing to do
There's nothing to say
This love's sweet like tooth decay
I spent it on that godforsaken monday
I should cook brekky at home and do what my momma say
I'm sitting alone, sipping a latte
Heartache every single time I wake up
The girl got me shake up
Friend wound her waist up on me
Now I found there's nothing to say...

[Chorus]
Why, does she cry?
Cuz' these social sites
This bliss is crystallized, like dolomite
I need a place to sink, my aura stinks
And if you'd realize

[Verse 2]
I have a girl, she's the best
She used to get the train, from southwest
But when she hit Clapham, it happened that I wasn't in ends
As friends we tend to lend funds
But she knows its not just girls who want to have fun
That's why....

[Chorus]
Why, does she cry?
Cuz' these social sites
This spliff is really nice, but I need a light
I need a place to sink, my aura stinks
And if you'd realize

[Verse 3]
There's nothing to do
It was as slimy day
I lost my baby, now I'm fading away
There's nothing ruthless, I just seem to be useless
And truth gets something inside of the way
I'm sitting alone, sipping a latte
With heartache every single time I wake up
Girl got me shake
A friend round her waist
Now I found there's nothing to say...

[Chorus]
Why, does she cry?
Cuz' these social sites
This bliss is crystallized, like dolomite
I need a place to sink, my aura stinks

[Outro]
And if you realize
And if you realize
And if you realize
And if you realize

12481,Drowsy,Banes World,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, you're cold, about it
Now that you know, about it
Will it show?
I don't doubt it
Antidote, I found it
Feeling low, about it
On the go, without it
Want to go home, should I shout it?
I miss my home

[Verse 2]
Now you know, that I'm not all that you thought I would be
Grateful I showed the real me
Yeah, it shows
When you look in my eyes, it breaks all my bones
"
12476,Winter's Ballad,Cuco,"[Verse]
Due to my frustration
I waited way too long to say a thing
Sure I accept that I was sad, so I guess now it's not so bad
I lost the memories deep inside my head
Show me that tonight I'm only yours and no one else's
Too blind to see sometimes that you're the one
Now I see you're everything, or just maybe my nothing
They say that nothing lasts forever
My bed was meant for two and now I'm missing only you
Or was this spot reserved for no one more?
My lonely days are here, I don't think I see you here
I wish that I could sleep until forever
I don't think it's hard just to tell me that you love me
But you're far away from here and have my heart
So shoot me with the bow that cupid's quiver has one more
The last time I might get to fall in love

12453,I Go Crazy,Flesh For Lulu,"[Intro]
I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you

[Verse 1]
What have I done today
Just sat and watched the jets fly over
A car goes by and the sun goes down we talk about the town

This city's mad in the head and sick in the soul
All the stars flew away a long time ago
Isn't that nice like Miami Vice

[Chorus]
I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you

[Verse 2]
Well your life is like an infants dream it's like everything's on TV
You see your face in the mirror could it be your place in the mirror
And so we turn on the TV one more time
And see that everything is fine

[Pre-Chorus]
But what have I done today
I go crazy
What have I done today
I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you
What have I done today What have I done today

Sue-Ellen looks so upset
This isn't the first time and it won't be the last
Things going on behind her back oh they give you a heart attack

[Chorus 2]
I go crazy when I'm without you, go crazy
I go crazy when I'm without you, go crazy

[Outro]
I go crazy when I'm without you
But what have I done today
I go crazy
But what have I done today
I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you
Go crazy
I go crazy when I'm without you
But what have I done today

12493,Kids,Current Joys,"[Verse 1]
Oh I'm just a kid
I never use my brain
I only use my heart
And my imagination

[Verse 2]
Oh I'm just a kid
I always make mistakes
And I never say I'm sorry
'Cause they're mistakes that I made
(Get ready, now)

[Verse 3]
Oh I'm just a kid
I've never seen the world
And I haven't quite decided
If I'm a boy or a girl

[Verse 4]
Oh I'm just a kid
I'm afraid of the dark
But I'm obsessed with ideas
One day I'll go far

[Verse 5]
Oh I'm no longer a kid
And everything has changed
There's nothing in my heart
And lightning in my brain

[Verse 6]
So listen up you kids
And hear what I say
Don't listen to your brain
And follow your dreams

12486,Pretty Girls,Michael Seyer,"[Verse 1]
Pretty girls
They never notice ugly boys like me
Even if I wear my heart on sleeves
They always seem to put me down

[Verse 2]
Pretty girls
They always seem to bite so hard
Even when I say don’t play
Insists that I will stay till dark

[Hook]
Its okay, I don’t much care
For the kempt hair, that’s just all looks
And if you say, that you do care
What people stare, then that’s how you look

[Verse 3]
Pretty girls
They always want to be alone
But every time they're by themselves
They always tell me help yourself

[Verse 4]
Pretty girls
They never deal with sadness well
And never think about their joys
That’s why they need ugly boys

[Hook]
Its okay, I don’t much care
For the kempt hair, that’s just all looks
And if you say, that you do care
What people stare, then that’s how you look

[Bridge] (Spoken)
Hey there baby I just wanted to let you know that
Its pretty hard being so damn pretty
And whenever you feel sad and blue
Just know that I am the one watching you while you sleep
The one that feels your tears drip down to your pillow
And hears all your dreams, nightmares and inhibitions
You pretty pretty girl

Did the girls go? Oh

12452,Love Vigilantes,New Order,"[Verse 1]
Oh I've just come
From the land of the sun
From a war that must be won
In the name of truth
With our soldiers so brave
Your freedom we will save
With our rifles and grenades
And some help from God

[Chorus]
I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

[Verse 2]
You just can't believe
The joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave
And I was going home
Oh I flew through the sky
My convictions could not lie
For my country I would die
And I will see it soon

[Chorus]
I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

[Verse 3]
When I walked through the door
My wife she lay upon the floor
And with tears her eyes were sore
I did not know why
Then I looked into her hand
And I saw the telegram
That said that I was a brave, brave man
But that I was dead

[Chorus]
I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home

12497,Dancing,Mellow Fellow,"[Verse 1]
Years ago when I had a chance
I could've held your hand
But I was young and then I blew every circumstance
Yet I still think
I dream of

[Chorus 1]
Dancin', dancin'
Oh, with you, with you
And maybe even share a drink or two
While I tell you the truth
That I don't even care what this is for
As long as I get to share the floor
Oh, with you, with you
With you

[Verse 2]
In my thoughts and dreams
I do a little swayin' away
Swayin' away with you
Even if I know it'll never realize
Maybe one day I'll wake up
Maybe someday it'll be true
Maybe that day I'll be
I will be

[Chorus 2]
Dancin', dancin'
Oh, with you, with you
And maybe even love you a little more
While we tango across the floor
And I don't even know when I'll see you again
I'll just keep living this dream 'till the end
Oh, with you, with you
With you

12479,Nice Boys,TEMPOREX,"[Verse 1]
Ain't it just so easy to say
You don't feel the same way
As that Nice Boy does, bae?
He misses you, he wants you, but
You just don't feel the same
Why don't you tell him today?
Yeah, huh-huh-huh

[Verse 2]
She doesn't want him because he cares too much
But now he's gone and she's alone again
Maybe if she tried a little harder to find
The gem within his heart that was there this whole time
(Bitch!)

Baby, what can I do?
Baby, come through
To me
Baby, I think it's you
Never was me

12475,Four Portraits,Vansire,"There's Arnold
With his back to me
Wandering down through an ill-lit street
I'm curious
And would like to entreat
Is this inspiration or self-defeat?

And from the corner, his figure fades
And should I follow or retrograde?

There's Anton
With a furrowed brow
A crooked finger and non-plussed scowl
There's symmetry
He will soon endow
Crafting tone rows with his head faced down

If I take pleasure in melodies
Have I betrayed best tendencies?

Oh Alban
We part our hair the same
Posing next to a drawer and frame
At 23 and two years of age
Your work is tasteful, your life's urbane

As for the despots who bring you down
A century later, they're still around

And so I sit by the windowsill
Feeling sad, the questions linger still
I'm trying to decide if it's fake or real

I'm all alone
In a noisy throng
Nameless and ageless, all strung along
Nobody else can name this song
Mispronunciations and words spelled wrong

At times like these, I think I'm on my own
A new self-portrait of my own

12492,Do You Feel It?,Chaos Chaos,"[Verse 1]
Lay it, lay it down, let me see your hand
Show me what you got
You're always talking, but you're not playing
It doesn't match your face
Gotta find my way, away from this place
Can you take me now?
I-I want it, I want it real
Are you afraid of me now?
Are you afraid of me now?

[Chorus]
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel that I can see your soul?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel the beat in your heart?
I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now
I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now

Some days I'm built of metal, I can't be broken
But not when I'm with you
You love me real, we have it all
Can't leave me now
I love the way you are today
Run away with me now
Wind in my hair 'cause I don't care
Baby, run away with me now
Run away with me now

Drinking in the summer, I'm good at running
I beat you in the race again
Are you afraid when I look your way?

We have no control

The kind that makes us young
The kind
That makes us young

Would it show on my face?
And remind you
I don’t mind you

Then honestly I’m fine
With keeping my trust in you

But if I did all that I had to do
Would you be here in my room?

And honestly, I’m fine
With keeping my own advice
And making up if we tried
I'm hardly unsatisfied
You’re not heels over head
But darlin'

Doing alright

Should be waiting for the sun

Going back to where the skies are blue
Going home to find the world

Should be waiting for the sun

To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want but I can't deal with all your lovers
You're saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another

I was raging, it was late
In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once
Yes, I'm changing, yes, I'm gone
Yes, I'm older, yes, I'm moving on
And if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along with me
Life is moving, can't you see?
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby, now there's nothing left that

[Chorus]
I can do
So don't be blue
There is another future waiting there for you

[Verse 2]
I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change but that's bullshit, they do
Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted, I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there and it's calling my name
And it's calling yours, girl, it's calling

[Chorus]
Yours too
It's calling yours too
It's calling yours too
It's calling yours too

[Outro]
It's callin' out for you
Arise and walk on through (Time rolls on)
The world beyond that door
Is callin' out for you (Time rolls on)
Arise and walk on through
It's callin' out for you (Listen to it call)
Arise and walk, come through
The world beyond that door (Listen to it call)
Is callin' out for you

12461,If I Ever Lose My Faith In You,Sting,"[Verse 1]
You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You would say I lost my sense of direction
Yes, you could say all of this and worse but

[Chorus]
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

[Verse 2]
Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You would say I lost my belief in our politicians
They all seem like game show hosts to me

[Chorus]
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

[Bridge]
I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face

I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a - a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first

12463,If You Were Here,Thompson Twins,"If you were here
I could deceive you
And if you were here
You would believe
But would you suspect
My emotion wandering, yeah
Do not want a part of this anymore

The rain water drips
Through a crack in the ceiling
And I'll have to spend
My time on repair
But just like the rain
I'll be always falling, yeah
Only to rise and fall again

If you were here
I could deceive you
And if you were here
You would believe
But would you suspect
My emotion wandering, yeah
Do not want a part of this anymore

12487,Falling for U,Peachy!,"[Verse 1]
I was hanging with you and then I realized
I didn't think it was true, I was surprised
When I found out I'd fallen for you (Da-da)
I didn't wanna believe my feelings for you
I didn't wanna believe that I could lose you
If I told you just how I felt

[Verse 2]
But I can't help it, I'm falling for you
And I can't quit it 'cause I'm stuck on you
And it might be pathetic and you might be skeptical
But I just want to be with you
Please tell me, boy, can you get a clue or come through?
'Cause I just want to be with you

[Bridge]
I'm scared
Of telling you how I feel
Maybe it's better
If I just try to conceal the truth
For me and for you

[Outro]
But I'm still stuck on you
I, I, I'm still falling for you (For you)
For you
Mm, mm
Mm, mm-mm, mm

Secret
Secret

[Verse 1]
I've got a secret and I can't explain
All the time I've waited for this day
All along I was never in doubt
I always knew it would never get out
There are things that I cannot tell
And there are things that you know damn well
This is getting very hard for me
I guess you'd better just wait and see

[Chorus]
This is all
This is all, oh
Secret

[Verse 2]
You heard a message and the message was clear
All the time you wipe away that tear
All I want is to hold your hand
To see the sun and walk the sand
You make me sad and you make me glad
And now you see all my secret is, is love
Is love, is love
My secret is this love

[Bridge]
Every day you're always there
You comfort me and make me feel it's worth my while
And then I look around and you're not there
And every day you say you care and I'll beware
Secret

This is all
This is all, oh

I've got a secret and I can't explain (This is all)

12485,Peach Pit,Peach Pit,"[Verse 1]
Oh peach pit where'd the hours go
When your orange skin began to glow
From a hanging branch in gardens home
Not much is hidden underneath
A rocky heart for breaking teeth
And apple cores cyanide seed

[Chorus]
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you

[Verse 2]
Lift back and see the darkness hid
Swallowed up and angled in
Looking back at sweetness dim
Ripe June had leaf and shady friend
The cool air is gone again

[Chorus]
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you

Oh peach pit where'd the hours go
When your orange skin began to glow
From a hanging branch in gardens home

All this rotting fruit with you

This rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you

We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
Say you'll stay, never be severed

You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

Heard you say things could be better

Hold my hand, feel my love
But understand it's all just luck
No such thing as true love
It's all just luck, lucky love

[Chorus]
But that don't make love weak; it's unique
The chances that we'd meet and just speak
A million ways they get just to live
And I'm just lucky this is it
This is it

Plant your feet, take a stand
In the grand scheme, it's all just chance
No such thing as true love
It's all just luck, lucky love

"
12464,I Beg Your Pardon,Kon Kan,"Here we go

There once was a time and there once was a way
We had something going and to my dismay
Attention to me seemed to drift, though I don't know where

And when we're alone, seems there's nothing to say
I bring up a topic and you push it away
You say that you do, but I think it's just you don't care
Why do I feel you're using me?

Are we an item or are we just two?
I need some commitments, all I ask of you
Your lifestyle can change
Don't be 'fraid what you think's in store

I know what's on your mind, you've got lots to lose
Your shallow acquaintances, what's there to choose?
You won't get too deep even though I'm worth so much more

So think about it carefully

Smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

Do you want to hustle?
Do you want to salsa?

Do you want to hustle?
Do you want to salsa?

If that's how you want it, that's how it'll be
There's no use in trying or making you see
That love don't come easy, you don't know what it's about

To get things together won't take any pain
Don't need to see/hear from you ever again
From this day on, listen but no more
Please count me out, and you know what I'm talkin' about

Smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I know now's the time that I went to find something new
You know it's your crime that I'm out to find someone too

12450,When She Cries,Restless Heart,"[Verse 1]
The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

[Verse 2]
When all of my hopes were dyin'
Her love kept me tryin'
But she does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

[Chorus]
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fears she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

[Verse 3]
She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

[Verse 4]
I don't know how she takes it
Just once, I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her lovin' eyes

[Chorus]
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

[Chorus]
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

12499,Sick Feeling,boy pablo,"[Verse 1]
I had to catch the bus
Alarm was shaking, oh
Almost landed on the floor
So ready for you then
To leave was a mistake
What was I waiting for?

[Chorus]
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go

[Verse 2]
I used to turn you on
I used to be by your side
And now the rest is leaving me behind

[Pre-Chorus]
I miss the way you sound
I miss to be around you
Just let me have another chance

[Chorus]
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go

What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go

12467,Stuck on the puzzle,Alex Turner,"[Verse 1]
I'm not the kind of fool who's gonna sit and sing to you
About stars, girl
But last night I looked up into the dark half of the blue
And they'd gone backwards

[Pre-Chorus]
Something in your magnetism must have pissed them off
Forcing them to get an early night
I have been searching from the bottom to the top
For such a sight as the one I caught when I saw your

[Chorus]
Fingers dimming the lights
Like you're used to being told that you're trouble
And I spent all night
Stuck on the puzzle

[Verse 2]
Nobody I asked knew how he came to be the one to whom
You surrendered
Any man who wasn't led away into the other room
Stood pretending

[Pre-Chorus]
That something in your magnetism hadn't just made him drop
Whoever's hand it was that he was holding
I have been searching from the bottom to the top
For such a sight as the one I caught when I saw your

[Chorus]
Fingers dimming the lights
Like you're used to being told that you're trouble
And I spent all night
Stuck on the puzzle

[Outro]
I tried to swim to the side
But my feet got caught in the middle
And I thought I'd seen the light
But oh, no
I was just stuck on the puzzle
Stuck on the puzzle

12494,"Call It Fate, Call It Karma",The Strokes,"[Verse 1]
Close the door
Not all the way
He don't understand
We don't understand
So don't you wanna remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

[Chorus]
Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around to wait in a room
Having a hard time watching you

[Verse 2]
You got it down now, don't you?
I wanted to understand your face
So don't you wanna remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around to wait in a room
Having a hard time watchin' you (Watchin' you)

12474,Lover Is a Day,Cuco,"[Chorus]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

[Verse 1]
Straight up ahead, you'll find a sign
That says you can't get by with a lie
But if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path
And made my life harder lying 'bout the stupid shit I say
Then you wouldn't know a single thing about
How I feel about you and those really dumb things people feel
I'll take the bumpy road, it'll probably break my legs
As long as I don't show you what's ruining my head
Funny thing about you is you read me pretty well
But you haven't found me yet at the bottom of the well
Annoying you with smoke signals, asking you for help
'Cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from Hell
Me and Mr. Heart, we say the cutest things about you
How you seem unreal and we'd probably die so quick without you
Suffocated from the radiated air around us
Full of happiness we don't have, brightness gone
So dark without you, girl

[Chorus]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

[Verse 2]
Family calls me crazy and my friends say I'm degenerate
But you tell me I'm so generous and my self-worth isn't hideous
This psychedelic canvas of the person I'm becoming
Went from horror movie on TV to happy-ending-princess me
Processing the information transferred from your mind to me
At light speed like the Falcon from the original Star Wars trilogy
Feeling like a free ol' me when I was six and no worries
Would stop me from reaching the stars
A million miles away from me
Sick in the head for you and no cure has been discovered
Like a plague hitting my body except if I fall, I'm just fallin' for you
Conscious beyond knowledge, alterations are acknowledged
And the beauty you've inflicted is always in its action
Lovely day today, perfect time to open up to you
But I know that you're having fun
Wouldn't wanna mess this up for you
But I'm happy that you're happy, at least I do that much for you
Always glad you're with me
This emotion will be gone before you know

[Chorus]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy, girl
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

It's not the first time
That I've watched you
Passing by
I've tried too hard
To get back there
But, you’re not on time
Anymore

Tried to get in with you
For a second time
You said the world's closed in
But you crawled in
Back inside

[Chorus]
So please
Run away
So please
Run away

[Verse 2]
I tried to believe in fate
For a second try
It's there in the safe
Why don't you
Close the blinds
For the night

Run away
So please
Run away

12465,Somebody,Depeche Mode,"[Verse 1]
I want somebody to share, share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts, know my intimate details
Someone who'll stand by my side and give me support
And in return, she'll get my support
She will listen to me when I want to speak
About the world we live in and life in general
Though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted
She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking, in fact, she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all, she will understand me

[Verse 2]
I want somebody who cares for me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things in a different light
All the things I detest I will almost like
I don't want to be tied to anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things
But when I'm asleep I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly
Though things like this make me sick
In a case like this, I'll get away with it

She lives in the place in the side of our lives
Where nothing is ever put straight

“This is it, that's the end of the joke”
And loses herself in her dreaming and sleep
And her lovers walk through in their coats

She's pretty in pink

All of her lovers all talk of her notes
And the flowers that they never sent
And wasn't she easy?

Is the last to remember her name
He's walking around in this dress that she wore
She is gone, but the joke's the same

Caroline talks to you softly sometimes
She says, “I love you” and “too much”
She doesn't have anything you want to steal
Well, nothing you can touch
She waves
She buttons your shirt
The traffic is waiting outside, she hands you this coat
She gives you her clothes, these cars collide

Confidence is in the sea
And all their favorite rags are worn
And other kinds of uniform
They kid you
You're really free
And you know what you want to be
Case of individuality
Until tomorrow
And everything you are
You'll see
In pure shiny buttons
They put you in this gear
And driveways broken
Doorbell sings in chimes
It plays 'Anything Goes'
Bells toll in rhyme

Mine immaculate dream
Made breath and skin, I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you
(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces)
Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

[Pre-Chorus: Simon Le Bon]
We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into crime

Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?

[Verse 2: Simon Le Bon & Tessa Niles]
Words, playing me déjà vu
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before
Chills, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
(Can not forgive from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces)
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into crime

[Verse 1]
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave, but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hair's alright
Hey, babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[Chorus]
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so

[Bridge]

[Outro]
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chi, chi-chi
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like I've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooh, your face is a mess
Ooh, ooh, so how could they know?
Ah, ah, how could they know?
Ah, ah

12544,Starman,David Bowie,"[Intro]
Hey, now now
Goodbye love

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll
""Lotta soul,"" he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
""Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie""

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
""Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie""
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky

'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile

Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie""

We can beat them, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

[Chorus]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we can be heroes, just for one day

[Bridge]
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes

We are nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day

12502,Believe In Me,Lenny Kravitz,"[Verse 1]
Where's the love we had?
When did it go bad?
Or am I just insecure?
I give all I can
Baby I'm your man
Tell me what you're in this for
Remind me

[Chorus]
I can't go on
I know not what to do
My heart is worn
I feel as If I'm through
Please believe in me
'Cause what I need is for you
To believe in me

Countless sleepless nights
Never ending fights
I'm trying to make your dreams come true
I will sacrifice to find paradise
But I need to know that you're behind me

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine
Oh, my Lola

Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh, my Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, ""Little boy, won't you come home with me?""

And I'd never, ever kissed a woman before

Ran away from me and to move brings me up
And relieves my stress whenever you're around
I hate everything less, don't let me see you blue
I'd lose my voice for you
And all the color schemes in this world
Don't have a thing on this girl
Cause you're-

No te preocupes, mi amor; es verdad, la voy a ver

Probé de tu droga, fue un frenesí
Mi vicio, me ahoga, no quiero salir
No quiero salir

Y si preguntas por mi te dirán
Que ando con muchas, pero no es verdad
Yo por ti estoy loco, me volviste loco, yeah

[Verso 2]
Me pregunto dónde estás
Te escribo, te llamo y no contestas
Dime si es que junto a mi tú no ves paz
O si crees lo que dicen los demás, los demás
Solo estoy pensando en ti mientras enrolo
Si me prendo uno me controlo
Solo pienso en el futuro ma'
Y espero que tú pienses igual
Tú y yo estamos locos
Confiamos en pocos, tenemos el corazón roto
Pero podemos curarnos lo que hicieron otros
Solo pienso en el futuro ma'
Y espero que tú pienses igual

Y si preguntas por mi te dirán
Que ando con muchas, pero no es verdad

[Verso 3]
Yo no miento, te lo juro
Me hace daño la distancia entre los dos
Un loco con razón
Veo en cada mujer tu cara
Me hiciste brujería, cosas raras
Me tienes bebiendo solo en mi sala
Me tienes fumando como en La Habana
Como en La Habana
Soy adicto a lo que haces
Cuando muere la distancia entre los dos
Un loco con razón

Sé que está en algún lugar mejor
Donde no hay abuso, fuera de este mundo
Quiero encontrar el medio para yo
Poder hablar con ella, poder decirle a ella

[Coro]
Que aquí todo está peor
Que al igual que ella, mi voluntad también murió
Le quiero platicar que todo sale mal
Que yo la alcanzaría, teniendo la oportunidad

[Verso 2]
Sé que ella se siente mejor
Allá no hay suplicio, sería muy impulsivo
El utilizar el medio y llegar a lo desconocido
Sentirla al lado mío, y decir

[Coro]
Que todo está peor
Que al igual que ella, mi esperanza se murió
La quiero abrazar, que todo sea igual
Mi vida ya es tan gris que el dolor jamás se marchará

[Puente]
Me debería de acordar, debo yo recordar y sentirse mejor
Es mejor no creer en el amor, así como le hago yo
La debería de odiar por dejarme aquí, pero ella no escogió
Soy un simple amante loco y yo, he aprendido mi lección

Sé que está en algún lugar mejor
Donde no hay abuso, fuera de este mundo
Quiero encontrar el medio para yo

We don't have to know
Anyone at all
Anyone at all
Draw the blinds back slow
Sun fades in our room
Two begin to bloom
Silk skin lovers danced
With diamonds in their hands
Diamonds in their hands
We could feel like them
Rarely would we ask
Of things we used to have

[Chorus]
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that news to you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call

[Verse 2]
We don't have to go
Anywhere at all
Anywhere at all
Bless our garden's growth
Ivy climbs the wall
Heather in the fall
Smoke-screen those who stand
So righteous in our path
That never thought to ask
We'll define what's fair
Oh baby they prefer
Illusion to despair

[Chorus]
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that news to you?
That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call

[Bridge]
I see their heads against the windows
Breathing on the glass
Dreaming of the day that they can finally relax
If only this normality
Belonged to more than fantasy
It's too much

[Verse 3]
Well they're hoping and faking
They're curled in disdain
The flowers too tall for the table again
But it's alright, they called it faith

That I wanna call your name
Is that cool with you?
That I wanna call your name

But the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes

12531,Pensando en Ti,Canserbero,"[Letra de ""Pensando en Ti""]

[Intro]
¡Yaoh!
Pensando en ti
Sí, sí
Ninguna herida sana sin cicatriz
Así se derrumbó este amor

[Verso 1]
Como cientos de dominoes en fila
Cuando algún dedo al primero derriba
Como una casa hecha con cartas alta
Hasta que una tormenta sopla su puerta de forma agresiva
Como empujar a un niño de un año y medio de vida sin una maldita razón
Como un paracaidista que olvidó el paracaídas, así se derrumbó este amor
Y ni siquiera porque alguno de los dos quería
Sino por no tener un buen detector de mentiras
Porque de esa manera, en mi memoria vieras
La causa del problema, también la solución
Quizás me comprendieras, a menos que creyeras
Que no tengo defectos o soy el nuevo Dios, eoh
De nada sirve recordarte los besos de ojos cerrados
Los abrazos y sonrisas del pasado, los sueños trazados
Las veces que hemos llorado
Por cosas que han pasado y hemos superado
Los juegos, los secretos, los momentos contentos
Los sobrenombres tiernos
Que serían cursis de no ser por esto que sentimos
Que nos mantuvo siempre unidos
Y en sus tiempos libres hace que el mundo tenga sentido
Estoy tan confundido, no sé si llorar
Molestarme, o sentarme a pensar, buscarte o solamente esperar
Sigo dudando que en algo sirva rezar
Y he llegado a pensar que o Dios no existe o Dios es bipolar
Y aquí estaré, con tus fotos en mi memoria
Quizás con una nueva novia, pensando en ti
El tiempo sana heridas de manera obvia
Aunque ninguna herida sana sin dejar cicatriz
Quisiera tanto tener la voz de un cantante
Para no solo recitar, sino cantarte
Pues mi única defensa es explicarte este malentendido
Dame otra oportunidad y juro querrás envejecer conmigo
Esto es como caminar en círculos por horas
Como ver a un gato perseguir su cola
Es algo ilógico estar con otra persona y preguntarnos
Cómo hubiese sido si te hubieses permitido amarnos
Las calles que transito, los lugares que visito
La ropa que visto, insisto, todo me hace verte aquí
Ayer creí que te vi y al notar que no eras
Supe que aunque pueda, no quiero vivir sin ti

[Puente]
No te diré que creo que moriré sin ti
Porque no creo, no creo, no creo, ¡no creo!
Tú sabes que soy un guerrero, ouh-ouh-ouh
No te diré que no puedo vivir sin ti
Porque sí puedo, sí puedo, sí puedo, ¡sí puedo!
Sencillamente es que no quiero, ouh-ouh-ouh

[Verso 2]
Y aquí estaré esperándote, dándome mi puesto
Ojalá que cuando rectifiques yo aún esté dispuesto
A olvidar el pasado y perdonar que tú no me hayas perdonado
Y que no hayas notado que te amo; cuánto te amo
Diviértete, vuela muy lejos
Que si llegamos a viejos y nos vemos
Te diré ""Te odio"" después de aspirar tu pelo
Y si morimos y hay un cielo, me escaparé del infierno
Y te haré el amor en una nube en honor a nuestros recuerdos
Mira lo cursi que me has convertido
Si esto no es amor entonces soy un loco sin motivo
Quiero seguir vivo solo para
Algún día decirte en tu cara que aún te amo
Aunque aún todo puede ser diferente
Si nos juntamos y cambiamos este tema por uno que diga
""Vivieron felices para siempre""

Eh, yaoh
¡Vivieron felices para siempre!

Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walkin' around with a limp and a hunch

You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now

It froze me deep inside

Come back, come back, don't walk away
Come back, come back, come back today
Come back, come back, why can't you see?
Come back, come back, come back to me

That it couldn't be me and be her in between without you
Without you
Without you, without you

Without you, without you
Without you, without you

Tell each other you're the one
While we're laying by the poolside, poolside
Getting tired from the sun
Fading in and out of long nights, long nights
There's no limit to your love
East or west we got the north lights, north lights
Oh oh, take in it all

What a time to be alive

When our prime has come and gone
And our youth is all but melted, melted
We can listen to this song
So we don't have to accept it, accept it
Just as long as you'll be home
In the world we've manifested-fested
Oh oh, just take in it all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive

Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six full years of my life on your trail

[Bridge]
And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at the Y.W.C.A
I said ""I like it here, can I stay?
I like it here, can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?""

She was left behind and sour
And she wrote to me equally dour
She said ""In the days when you were hopelessly poor
I just liked you more""

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

[Chorus]
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I

Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent too long on your trail
Far too long chasing your tail

12561,It's The End Of The World As We Know It,R.E.M.,"[Verse 1]
That's great
It starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes
An aeroplane
Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Speed it up a notch, speak, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter with fear fight, down, height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left her and wasn't coming in a hurry with the Furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh-oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine

[Verse 2]
Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a votive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh-oh, this means
No fear, cavalier renegade steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives
And I decline

[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock

And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting

All men have secrets and here is mine
So let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I think I can rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front
Of a flying bullet for you

[Chorus]
So, what difference does it make?
So, what difference does it make?
It makes none, but now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight

[Verse 2]
The devil will find work
For idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
Because you asked me to
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
But I'm still fond of you
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
So, what difference does it make?
Oh, what difference does it make?
Oh, it makes none, but now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

Oh, the devil will find work
For idle hands to do
I stole, and then I lied
Just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you
Oh-oh-oh

But no more apologies
No more, no more apologies
Oh, I'm too tired, I'm so sick and tired

Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover""
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus]
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Ooh, slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

[Verse 2]
She said, ""It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again""
I said, ""I appreciate that, and would you please explain
About the fifty ways?""
She said, ""Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light""
And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus]
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

12592,Pictures of You,The Cure,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

[Verse 3]
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

[Verse 4]
Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

[Verse 5]
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels, so much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 6]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
And always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you

12595,Sign of the Times,Harry Styles,"[Verse 1]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

[Bridge]
We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

[Outro]
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away

12593,Close To Me,The Cure,"[Verse 1]
I've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me

[Verse 2]
Just try to see in the dark, just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait until I shake

[Chorus]
But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

[Verse 1]
I've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me

Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

12551,All Things Must Pass,George Harrison,"[Verse 1]
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always gonna be this gray

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away

[Verse 2]
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always gonna be this gray

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away

[Bridge]
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So, I must be on my way and face another day

[Verse 3]
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always gonna be this gray

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away

Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried

12563,Into The Great Wide Open,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,"[Verse 1]
Eddie waited 'til he finished high school
He went to Hollywood, got a tattoo
He met a girl out there with a tattoo, too
The future was wide open
They moved into a place they both could afford
He found a night club he could work at the door
She had a guitar and she taught him some chords
The sky was the limit

[Chorus]
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue

[Verse 2]
The papers said Ed always played from the heart
He got an agent and a roadie named Bart
They made a record and it went in the charts
The sky was the limit
His leather jacket had chains that would jingle
They both met movie stars, partied and mingled
Their A&R man said, ""I don't hear a single""
The future was wide open (Oh)

[Chorus]
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Into the great wide open
A rebel without a clue (Ayy)

12594,All Those Years Ago,George Harrison,"[Verse 1]
I'm shoutin' all about love
While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago

[Verse 2]
Talkin' all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love

[Bridge]
Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

[Verse 3]
We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago

[Instrumental Break]
All those years ago
All those years ago

[Bridge]
Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
All else that we despised

[Verse 4]
They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all, though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago

[Outro]
All those years ago
All those years ago

12569,The Bitch Is Back,Elton John,"[Verse 1]
I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back (oh)

[Verse 2]
Eat meat on Friday, that's alright
I even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh

[Verse 3]
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my God, what's that?
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back (oh)

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh

12582,Moondance,Van Morrison,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, it’s a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous  night to make romance
’Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I’m trying to please to the calling
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low

[Pre-Chorus]
You know the night’s magic seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

[Verse 2]
Well, I want to make love to you tonight
I can’t wait ’til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you’re never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
Then I know how much you want me that you can’t hide

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

12552,Two Fine People,Yusuf / Cat Stevens,"Now that I've passed your test
How can I prove to you baby I'll never let you down?
If I led you around, I'm sorry but I never meant to worry you know

Now that I've kissed your breast
How can I prove to you baby I'll never make you sad
If I ever had, do believe your tears  won't come back again

I love you, though the stars may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you till my body changes into an old man
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain

La la la la la la
You know I wish for you baby nothing but good times ahead
Anything that Heaven can give you, I can give you instead

La la la la la la
How could I lie to you baby? I'll never lead you around
I'll take care of everything you need, darling every little need will be found

I love you though the time may change and snowmen sleep in the sea
And I really only want you to want me
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain

Now that you've shown your heart
I'll be right with you baby, I'll never leave you alone
Anywhere you want me to be honey, I'll be there to have and to hold

And now that the clouds roll back, hold on to me baby
We're going never to land, flying on the power of love
Flying on the power of love

I love you, though time may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you, till the very same come back to the land
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain

Two fine people should love each other
Two fine people should help each other
Two fine people should love each other
Two fine people should help each other

12555,Wasteland,The Jam,"Meet me on the wastelands - later this day
We'll sit and talk and hold hands maybe
For there's not much else to do in this drab and colourless
Place
We'll sit amongst the rubber tyres
Amongst the discarded bric-a-brac
People have no use for - amongst the smouldering embers of
Yesterday

And when or if the sun shines
Lighting our once beautiful features
We'll smile but only for seconds
For to be caught smiling is to acknowledge life
A brave but useless show of compassion
And that is forbidden in this drab and colourless world

Meet me on the wastelands - the ones behind
The old houses - the ones - left standing pre-war -
The ones overshadowed by the monolith monstrosities -
Councils call homes

And there amongst the shit - the dirty linen
The holy Coca-Cola tins - the punctured footballs
The ragged dolls - the rusting bicycles
We'll sit and probably hold hands

And watch the rain fall (watch it, watch it)
Tumble and fall (tumble and falling)
Like our lives (like our lives)
Just like our lives

We'll talk about the old days
When the wasteland was release when we could play
And think - without feeling guilty -
Meet me later but we'll have to hold hands
Tumble and fall (tumble and falling)
Like our lives (like our lives)
Exactly like our lives

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?

I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes
You told me

Oh, yes you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you

So come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you

But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me

I just can't go on anymore

I could never really live without you

12566,A Hazy Shade of Winter,Simon & Garfunkel,"[Verse 1]
Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please
But look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

[Verse 2]
Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside
It’s bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand
And look around you
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

[Verse 3]
Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hope should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

[Verse 4]
Ahhh, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

[Outro]
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground

12579,Out Of Tune,Real Estate,"In no solid state
You know we can't cop to
The frequency of your inner debate
It was all out of tune

Yourself a weeping clown
You play along to songs written for you
But you're all out of tune

You're all out of tune

See the cars on the 95
Cut through them like a sharpened knife
Oh oh

You're all out of tune

See the cars on the 95
Cut through them like a sharpened knife
Oh oh

You've got the wrong attitude

In no solid state
You know we can't cop to

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin' home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

[Verse 2]
When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away
On the road and hangin' by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

[Verse 3]
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend, but kept the memory

[Verse 4]
Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

[Verse 5]
Now his life is full of wonder, but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky Mountain high

[Outro]
Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

12580,Honky Cat,Elton John,"[Verse 1]
When I look back, boy, I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind

[Chorus 1]
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

[Verse 2]
Well, I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the fools back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, ""Believe in the Lord"" is the golden rule

[Chorus 2]
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, change is gonna do me good
(Ooh, baby)
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

[Verse 3]
They said, stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city, boy, is, is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no
Ha, how can you stop when your feet say go

[Chorus 1]
You better get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

[Outro]
Oh yeah, get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Oh, get back, honky cat, get back
Get back, honky cat, whoo
Oh yeah, redneck ways and
Whoo

12571,Awaiting On You All,George Harrison,"[Verse 1]
You don't need no love in
You don't need no bed pan
You don't need a horoscope or a microscope
To see the mess that you're in
If you open up your heart
You know what I mean
We've been polluted so long
Now here's a way for you to get clean

[Chorus]
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
Yes, the Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
Chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
Yes, the Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see

[Verse 2]
You don't need no passport
And you don't need no visas
You don't need to designate or to emigrate
Before you can see Jesus
If you open up your heart
You'll see He's right there
He always was and will be
He'll relieve you of your cares

[Chorus]
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
Yes, the Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
Yes, the Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see

[Verse 3]
You don't need no church house
And you don't need no Temple
You don't need no rosary beads or them books to read
To see that you have fallen
If you open up your heart
You know what I mean
We've been kept down so long
Someone's thinking that we're all green

[Outro]
While the Pope owns 51% of General Motors
And the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us
But the Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free

12559,The King of Wishful Thinking,Go West,"[Verse 1]
I don't need to fall at your feet
Just 'cause you cut me to the bone
And I won't miss
The way that you kiss me
We were never carved in stone

If I don't listen
To the talk of the town
Then maybe I can fool myself

[Chorus]
I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking

And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
I am the king of wishful thinking

[Verse 2]
I refuse to give in to my blues
That's not how it's going to be
And I deny the tears in my eyes
I don't want to let you see
No
That you have made a hole in my heart
And now I've got to fool myself

[Chorus]
I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking

And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking

Shed a tear for you

If I don't listen to the talk of the town
Then maybe I can fool myself

I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
I'm the king of wishful thinking

I'll get over you
I know I will
You made a hole in my heart
But I won't shed a tear for you
I'll be the king of wishful thinking

I'll get over you
I'll pretend my heart's still beating
'Cause I've got no more tears for you
I'm the king of wishful thinking

I'll get over you
I know I will
You made a hole in my heart
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking

12598,Rising Sun,George Harrison,"[Verse 1]
On the street of villains taken for a ride
You can have the devil as a guide
And crippled by the boundaries, programmed into guilt
Until your nervous system starts to tilt
And in the room of mirrors you can see for miles
But everything that's there is in disguise
Every word you've uttered and every thought you've had
Is all inside your file, the good and the bad

[Chorus 1]
But in the rising sun
You can feel your life begin
Universe at play inside your DNA
And you're a billion years old today

[Chorus 2]
Oh the rising sun
And the place it's coming from
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun

[Verse 2]
On the avenue of sinners I have been employed
Working there until I was near destroyed
I was almost a statistic inside a doctor's case
When I heard the messenger from the inner space
He was sending me a signal that for so long I had ignored
But he held on to my umbilical cord
Until the ghost of memory trapped in my body, mind
Came out of hiding to become alive

[Chorus 3]
And in the rising sun
You can hear your life begin
And it's here and there, nowhere and everywhere
Though its atmosphere is rare

[Chorus 4]
Oh the rising sun
And the place that it's coming from
Is inside of me and now I feel it constantly
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 1]
But in the rising sun
You can feel your life begin
Universe at play inside your DNA
And you're a billion years old today

[Chorus 2]
Oh the rising sun
And the place it's coming from
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun

12556,Stay Free,The Clash,"[Intro]
We met when we were at school
Never took no shit from no one, we weren't fools
The teacher says we're dumb, we're only havin' fun
You know we piss on everyone in the classroom

[Verse 1]
When we got thrown out I left without much fuss
And weekends we'd go dancin' down Streatham on the bus
You always made me laugh, got me in bad fights
Play me pool all night, smokin' menthols

[Verse 2]
I practiced daily in my room
You were down the Crown plannin' your next move
Go on a nickin' spree, hit the wrong guy
Each of you get three years in Brixton

[Bridge]
I did my very best to write
How was Butlins? Were the screws too tight?
When you lot get out were gonna hit the town
We'll burn it fucking down to a cinder

[Chorus]
'Cause years have passed and things have changed
And I move anyway I want to go
And I'll never forget the feelin' I got
When I heard that you'd got home

[Outro]
And I'll never forget the smile on my face
'Cause I knew where you would be
And if you're in the Crown tonight have a drink on me
But go easy
Step lightly, yeah
Stay free

12577,Cemetry Gates,The Smiths,"[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

[Verse 1]
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With-a loves and hates and passions just like mine
They were born, and then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair, I want to cry

[Verse 2]
You say, ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

[Verse 3]
If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take on loan
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall

[Verse 4]
You say, ""'Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text from whence was ripped
Some dizzy whore, 1804

[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose
'Cause whale blubber Wilde is on m-mine (Sugar)

Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?

And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

[Chorus]
Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry?

Got a feeling inside (Can't explain)
It's a certain kind (Can't explain)
I feel hot and cold (Can't explain)
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah (Can't explain)
I said (Can't explain)
I'm feeling good now, yeah, but (Can't explain)

[Pre-Chorus]
Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue
The things you've said, well, maybe they're true
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means, but

[Chorus]
Can't explain, I think it's love
Try to say it to you when I feel blue
But I can't explain (Can't explain)

12554,Rio,Duran Duran,"[Verse 1]
Moving on the floor now, babe, you're a bird of paradise
Cherry ice cream smile, I suppose it's very nice
With a step to your left and a flick to the right
You catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special
And you look like you're the best

[Chorus]
Her name is Rio, and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande

[Verse 2]
I've seen you on the beach, and I've seen you on TV
Two of a billion stars, it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

[Chorus]
Her name is Rio, and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
Hey now, woo, look at that
Did he nearly run you down?
At the end of the drive, the lawmen arrive
You make me feel alive, alive, alive
I'll take my chance, 'cause luck is on my side or something
I know what you're thinking
I’ll tell you something, I know what you're thinking

[Chorus]
Her name is Rio, and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande
Her name is Rio, she don't need to understand
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
Oh, Rio, Rio, hear them shout across the land
From mountains in the North down to the Rio Grande

12590,Wouldn't It Be Nice,The Beach Boys,"[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

[Bridge: Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson]
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true (Run, run, we-ooh)
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
But wouldn't it be nice?

[Outro: Mike Love]
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby

12576,Town Called Malice,The Jam,"[Verse 1]
Better stop dreaming of the quiet life
'Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus
'Cos those rosey days are few
And...stop apologising for the things you've never done
'Cos time is short and life is cruel
But it's up to us to change
This town called Malice

[Verse 2]
Rows and rows of disused milk floats
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives
Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing
When tears come fast and furious
In a town called Malice
Ye-eh-eah

[Hook]
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah, oh
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah

[Verse 3]
Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

[Bridge]
A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear
It's a big decision in a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

[Instrumental Middle Eight]

[Verse 4]
The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going 'round and 'round, oh
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah (uhuhuh)
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah
In this town called Malice, uhuh-yeah
"
12589,The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,"[Verse 1]
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest, hmm

[Verse 2]
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Runnin' scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

[Chorus]
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

[Verse 3]
Asking only workman's wages
I come lookin' for a job but I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, la la la la la la la

[Verse 4]
Now the years are rolling by me
They are rockin' evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be; that's not unusual
Nor is it strange
After changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same

[Chorus]
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

[Verse 5]
And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin' home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

[Verse 6]
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving"", but the fighter still remains

[Chorus]
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

12553,Teenage Kicks,The Undertones,"[Verse 1]
A teenage dream's so hard to beat
Every time she walks down the street
Another girl in the neighbourhood
Wish she was mine, she looks so good

[Chorus]
I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna call her on the telephone
Have her over 'cause I'm all alone
I need excitement, oh, I need it bad
And it's the best I've ever had

12578,Changes,David Bowie,"[Intro]
Oh yeah
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Interlude]
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Outro]
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

12586,The Long And Winding Road,The Beatles,"[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
And still, they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still, they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)

Must be the clouds in my eyes

They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been
And Daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen
Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord, I miss Daniel
Oh, I miss him so much

Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I

12617,Don't Look Back In Anger,Oasis,"[Verse 1]
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by
Her soul slides away
But ""Don't look back in anger,"" I heard you say

[Verse 2]
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But ""Don't look back in anger,"" I heard you say

Sun is down on east side

But would you ever do that for me?
For me
For me

Well, Billy boy, he's gifted
You know you can't deny it

You're only worth how much you sell
Yeah now

Just give the people what they need
Well, well

Will you turn away
Or will you take my place?
Does it start to show?
Now the pressure is on
Will they call my name
When it all goes up in flames?

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
(Hoo, yeah, haha)
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

[Chorus: 2-D & (Del the Funky Homosapien)]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Outro: 2-D]
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future

Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

[Bridge]
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know

Times are hard when things have got no meaning

The way it's gonna be, yeah
Maybe I can see, yeah

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be

You're simpatico
And of all the lift-homes and all the mixed feelings
You're cuts above
And you don't own worries or a chest full of heartache
Yes, I know
That I'll never work out exactly how you­'re thinking
But let me know when I'm needed home

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips

I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give in to you

Him off on down the river

It's impractical
To go out and catch a death with a dress­ fit for the summer
So, you don't
Instead you call me up with a head full­ of filth
Yes, I know
That I'll never acquiesce anything you're thinking
But let me know when I'm needed home

And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips

12630,Help Our Souls,NIHILS,"[Verse 1]
I've been stumbling around between the lines of red and blue
I was coloring thoughts for the sake of finding truth
Was following rules, counting all of my good deeds, oh
Living in fear, Hell at my feet, Heaven is out of reach

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a fire that I once laid
There's a fire but no fire brigade

[Chorus]
Help our souls tonight
We are losing, losing this fight
Help our souls tonight
Is there no one on our side

Who's gonna help our souls tonight?
No one here to
Help our souls tonight
It's on me, it's on you
To survive

[Verse 2]
And with the rising sun
I arose from ash and dust
I, I finally saw the world for what it was
The good and bad, they were part of one
No matter how hard I tried to run

It's always darkest before the dawn
Believe it cause you know it's inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Just fire
Not the fire brigade

Help our souls tonight
We are losing, losing this fight
Help our souls tonight
There is no one on our side
Who's gonna help our souls tonight?
No one here to
Help our souls tonight
Trust me, trust me
We’ll be alright

[Verse 3]
Oh we're burning up inside
With these questions on our minds
It's a quest for the heart
Gotta let go, restart
Looking who to blame
Who to trust in this game

The victims shall remain
As long as we deny our reign
The power that we seek
In our hands, in our feet
This song, it's a melody
A four part remedy

So don't be afraid
Cause there's nothing to fear
Don't let me hear you say
Don't let me hear who's gonna...

[Chorus]
Help our souls tonight
We are losing, losing this fight
Help our souls tonight
There is no one on our side
Who's gonna help our souls tonight?
No one here to
Help our souls tonight
Trust me, trust me
We’ll be alright

(Who’s gonna help our souls?)

12639,Better Man,Courteeners,"I'm bringing out my best impression
Of seven-year-old me in confession
It's never more appropriate than now

An open book, I'll open up if you do
Nothing to hide and very little to lose
It feels to me like things are on the change

I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
It's slightly disconcerting
No direction, no set plan
I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
Go on, give us a hand
Give us a hand

Another day, another gratitude list
Remembering the Amazon, November, when we kissed
Pages filled with rhymes and better times

Finding a lover and losing them to fate
Finding another, thank your lucky stars, mate
You do not know how lucky you are

I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
It's slightly disconcerting
No direction, no set plan
I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
Go on, give us a hand
Give us a hand

A helping hand
To understand
That I need to breathe
It's time to leave
This wonderland
Of wedding bands
And everyone in-between

I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
It's slightly disconcerting
No direction, no set plan
I'm trying to be a better man, whatever that is
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
Go on, give us a hand
Give us a hand

I really thought you'd be home by now
I guess I was wrong again
I used to think I could go somewhere
Turns out I'm ill-prepared

I kiss the bend of the canyon road where
I find your ghost again
You found the sky through the moonroof topless
You were so happy then

I'm right, I'm wrong
I'm everything but sure
My blazing head, my freezing heart
Your five words walk out the door

Would you run after me?
I feel I've stood here once before
Would you run after me?
Would you run or do we disappear?
Oh, disappear here
Would you run after me?
Would you run or do we disappear here?

Now you say, ""I see your face every turn I make
I find no comfort there""
I add, ""I hear your voice with every mistake
It's like you're always here""

I'm right, I'm wrong
I'm everything but sure
So we fight until dawn
When five words walk out the door

If nothing else, I'm feeling zen
It seems the world has gone to shit again
So pack your bags, we're leaving soon
I heard they're selling flights to the pink moon
You say your feet are cold, I guess we need to go
Somewhere warm on the West Coast
You look at me with that familiar face
You turn around and then you say

[Chorus]
""I think that we should move to San Francisco
That's where the happy people go""
You say you wanna go to San Francisco
But I, I just don't know
You say you wanna move to San Francisco
That's where the pretty people go
You say you wanna go to San Francisco
But I, I just don't know
I just don't know

[Verse 2]
I took advice and then I took a trip
You said you were born to run, but then I slipped
I guess I'm not the boss, oh, no one is
So don't be cynical as you purse your lips
You look at me and then you say
""This Monday feels like a Saturday""
So we lie in bed, yeah, we lie awake
And as you turn away

You say you wanna move to San Francisco
That's where the happy people go
You say you wanna go to San Francisco

Have you got anymore that I could steal?
Take me back, two years ago
When innocence was all we had

And she looks in the local news paper
Just to see your face

12643,Alive,Daughtry,"[Verse 1]
I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone
I played on my own
But I survived
Hey, hey
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine

I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow

You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing

[Post-Chorus]
I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went out and got it
I did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you

[Chorus]
And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)

That we all skate in 'til we got older

We were just a bunch of rowdy kids
No hope, no dreams, thought that was it
And then we got older

Stay up until the daylight
We always find our way home

Skating around the parking lot
Of Taco Bell 'til they called the cops

We were just a bunch of lousy kids
No cash, just tryna be legit
And then we got older

And blood is poisonous
And we're drowning in drama
But I won't give up

Where did it go, where did it go?

When you've been where we've been
Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers?
Are they there at all
Or is it just paranoia?

And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Here long before you

Not lining up to be Play-Doh

""Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?""

Tell 'em to take out their tongues
It's not you, it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash

It's not you, it's them that are wrong

Been acting kinda stupid?

Been dreaming kinda lucid?
Don't know if you're awake?
Mary don't mind if you slip away

Been acting kinda stupid?
Wishing you were dead?
Mary don't mind if she gets to your head

When you crack a window
Don't forget to breathe
When you crack a window
When you crack a window

When you hit the ceiling
Don't commit to feeling whole

You know you're never gonna give up
Never gonna hiccup
Never gonna take it slow

Baby you're a liar
Sometimes even more than you know
You have

Been dreaming kinda lucid?
Don't know if you're awake?
Mary don't mind if you slip away

Been acting kinda stupid?
Wishing you were dead?
Mary don't mind if she gets to your head

Been dreaming of a future
Where nothing's left to save?
Mary don't mind if you slip away

Been acting on a rumour?
That you're already dead
Mary don't mind if she gets to your head

Mary don't mind if she gets to your head
Mary don't mind if she gets to your head

12631,Woods,Mac Miller,"[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me
When will you forget my past?
Got questions, ask, you know the stories
And you need to let me know
When you're leaving, where you go
Can I come?
Do you believe me, are you close?
Yeah, even if you don't
That'll get you sprung

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't run away, love
Hate love, heartbreak will have you bankrupt
Too many days in a daze, better wake up
I put your face in a place where the space was
Nobody makes you feel like you but (Do I?)
And you don't know what you should do
You just lookin' for someone to make you move, ooh, tell me (Do I?)
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken
It's so much better when you wait
Forever and a day, that's all I got
Put it together then it break
All the energy it take, it never stop

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Bridge]
Yeah, I never slip, I never fall
I tried to tell you 'bout a better life
And get involved big or small
It's been my fault, I keep it safe, it's in the vault
Blindfolded, keep it going 'til we hit a wall, yeah
I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up
We can only go up

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

12624,Ace in the Hole,Saint Motel,"She's got style she's got grace
An appetite for expensive taste
They made the angels in her mold
Feels at home in a centerfold

Don't try lines and don't try jokes
She eats up men like Hall and Oates
There's no tricks that you can try
There's no gifts money can buy

Put your hands up
Before she turns and walks away
This is your one shot
Time for your ace in the hole

Put your hands up
Before she turns and walks away
This is your one shot
Time for your ace in the hole
Time for your ace in the hole

Put your quarters in the slot
Hope and pray for a jackpot
Better chances with the dice
Than take her home with you tonight

She doesn't bother finding love
There is no man that's good enough
Lucky sevens come up eights
Rabbit's feet won't help your fate

Put your hands up
Before she turns and walks away
This is your one shot
Time for your ace in the hole

Put your hands up
Before she turns and walks away
This is your one shot
Time for your ace in the hole
Time for your ace in the hole

Time for your ace in the hole
Time for your ace in the hole
Time for your ace in the hole

I'm putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice

[Verse 2]
Sellin' your body to the street
Sending your girlfriends to the night, for cheap
Wearing a jacket made of meat
Sealing a letter made with horse's feet
And now you've heard that

A violent crime
And that's the USA
Platinum's on the rise
Sleeping in the sky

And it's bad

Body at work and a mind on vacation
Who had the brain where it started to sink in?

I'm your man

Guess I've been taking a lot from you, oh
Searching so long for the truth, oh
You hoped that girl would chase you out the door
As you think it, it's already too late
Searching for meaning in a combination of notes

Get up in the mornin', it just hurts
And I think of all those little things
That you and I can do

Of bumpin' into you

Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby

Funny how it seems like yesterday

So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts

Let it be known
That I was worthy, I was worthy, I was worthy, I was

So I'm joining the army

But I'll be waiting for you

I'm feelin' rough, I'm feelin' raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

[Chorus]
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

I said yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

12654,Retrograde,HUDSUN,"Hey, what's that what're you talking 'bout?
Wait, come back it was just an idea
Not what i wanted to hear
Can't seem to make it feel right (x2)

Back when you dyed you old Jeans black, you'd scrub your makeup off the end the Day
Dust falls from the Curtains
Same old conversations, all so cliche
Don't remember feeling right, that was me well in my Prime
And noone ever warned me 'bout dreading in the morning after no shut eye

Hold on, don't look down
Can't move forward in my own Hometown
Lean back, find my place
Thought i was making some Ground

I can't relate, guess it's okay
Why can't i seem to make it feel right?
If i don't own all that i know, why can't i seem to make it feel right?

Hey, don't lock those Feelings away
Just let it all out
I can't relate, guess it's okay
Why can't i seem to make it feel right?

No, No, No, No

No one ever warned me
So hold on, don't look down
Can't move forward in my own Hometown
Lean back, find your place
Can't keep on falling from Grace

I can't relate, guess it's okay
Why can't i seem to make it feel right?
If i don't own all that i know, why can't i seem to make it feel right?

Hey, don't lock those Feelings away
Just let it all out
I can't relate, guess it's okay
Why can't i seem to make it feel right?

I can't relate, guess it's okay
Why can't i seem to make it feel right?
I can't relate, guess it's okay
Why can't i seem to make it feel right?

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Yeah, 'cause we share a friend
Doesn't mean your values fit the way I am
Just because I have smaller hands
Doesn't mean I can't do what my male friends can

[Verse 1]
I see that you, you are taller than me
But it's not true that I'm smaller than you
The work I do runs on passion and that's
I suppose the qualification
Don't get me wrong, I respect everything that you've done but
I do feel that this isn't the other way 'round
And that I don't understand, just 'cause my playground
Wasn't surrounded by men

[Chorus]
Yeah, 'cause we share a friend
Doesn't mean your values fit the way I am
Just because I have smaller hands
Doesn't mean I can't do what my male friends can

How I wish I said it to you
I'm too nice 'cause I believe in the good
But sometimes I wish I could act just like you

With the messed up coke teeth, poppies and pearls
Wearing in my new cold sweat

12659,Monster,Novustory,"Would you believe me if I said I was wasted?
I didn’t even like her
You kissed me just to spite her
Drank my drink, but I couldn’t even taste it
If I thought It‘d end like this
Do you think that’s worth a kiss?

And you took advantage, and I didn’t want this

This ain’t worth the hassle
And she ain’t worth your time
You spoke and I was dazzled
I’d never make, I’d never make you mine

You’ve got, false memories of the truth
It’s took 3 to to blow the story of the 2 of you

Now I said sorry, but I’m not wrong
I’ve been worried, for far too long

You’ve lost respect? Well it’s gone for you
If I’m a monster, then you’re one too

I never go out out on the weekend
And the one week that I do
I go run into you, and it’s the blunt end
This is why I’m never out
It isn’t worth the shouting

And you took advantage, And I didn’t want this

This ain’t worth the hassle
And she ain’t worth your time
You spoke and I was dazzled
I’d never make, I’d never make you mine

You’ve got, false memories of the truth
It’s took 3 to to blow the story of the 2 of you

Another poisoned dart right to my temple
And blew the candle out

You opened up the door and showed me freedom
Another mutilated romance

Like novocaine
You flood my brain and foolish electric heart
If I'm nothing you're it all

Now tell me something
Where'd you get that scar?
'Cause on the surface it's like a work of art
In New York City you tried to play guitar
Its strings were broken, you tuned it to my heart

12693,All The Way,Jimmy Eat World,"[Verse 1]
Going out, we hope to lose ourselves
Then get found in unlikely places
A little presumption's all you need
To end up empty
Who really says they hope they'll meet the one
For the first time at a bar drinking early?
Easy enough to say ""Hey man, I'm done""
And never hear them say

[Chorus]
Oh, honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
And no one really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
We get discouraged by the pointlessness
And we're pretty quick to judge things pointless
There's what I want and what I need
And the latter takes a while to see
It doesn't matter how often, how old
It starts with an awkward beginning
I believe that what I've learned has worth
And what I choose to do means something

[Chorus]
So honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
'Cause no one really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show, oh-ho, oh-ho

Crowds and the noise receding
Down to just you and me, yeah
We could do anything you want

So honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
Whoever really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show? Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

No need to point the finger that would be cold
You cried like a baby, ""Don't let me go""

Oh, let it burn, let it burn

[Verse 3]
It's 7:02, breaking all the rules
Dance the boogie-woogie and let's fire up the booze
'Cause we die to live, we die to live
We know about the law, but that won't get us far
When the rattlesnake is shaking and the gun is on the floor
We die to live

[Chorus]
We can go all night 'til the morning light
And the mayor will be there too
Call the cops who got all the drugs
And then send them home by noon
Let it burn, let it burn
Oh, well, let it burn, let it burn

[Outro]
Let it burn
Oh, let it burn, let it burn
Let it burn
Oh, let it burn, let it burn

12676,Island,Kensington,"[Verse 1]
I don't want to blame
I just want to leave this horrid place the way I came
But here we are again
I don't want to wait
For another wave to come and rule another day

[Verse 2]
I don't want to stay
I just want to wash away this vile and awful taste
But here we are again
Got nothing more to say
Only want to leave it and not seek for it again

[Chorus]
And I'll be an island
And the shore were I stand
Can't be reached by more than waves
I told my sharks
That I need an island
For I know the violence
And I'll make the same mistakes
Again

[Verse 3]
I don't want a flame
I don't want to risk a fire that leaves a toxic waste
But here we are again
And I don't want to play
Only want to breathe again, be free and let it end

[Chorus]
And I'll be an island
And the shore were I stand
Can't be reached by more than waves
I told my sharks
That I need an island
If it turns to violence
Then I swear I'll drift away
I cross my heart

[Bridge]
All will in time mend
When the moment is right, will the feeling die?
Who am I inside then?
When I know when I fight all I want is hide and
All will in time mend
When the moment is right, will the feeling die?
Who am I inside then?
When I know when I fight all I want is hide and
All will in time mend
When the moment is right, will the feeling die?
Who am I inside then?
When I know when I fight all I want is hide and
All will in time mend
When the moment is right, will the feeling die?
Who am I inside then?
When I know when I fight all I want is hide and

And I'll be an island
And the shore were I stand

I know my heart
I sold my heart

Let me up let me up
I wanna break my neck
Cut me into pieces till there's nothing left

Put a arrow in my heart
And a spear in my side
Cut my wrists and my throat
Tear out my fucking eye
Wrap me up in chains all soaked in petrol
Well choking in the gallows like a wretched devil
Nail me up for the world to see
Set fire to the cross that is carrying me
Hang me up, hang me up
Go on and break my neck
Cut me into pieces till there's nothing left

The kinda shit that makes you need some pills

12684,CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?,Bishop Briggs,"[Verse 1]
Sitting by the pool, thought that you were through
But every word you say is still all about you
You're outside your head, don't know where you went to
Stories are the same, still all about you

[Pre-Chorus]
Came close in the dead of night
Thought I couldn't do it but I knew I was right (Ah)
I was right (Ah), I was right
Take a sip but you call my bluff
Good to make me feel like I'm not good enough, oh

It's quiet and you're lonely
Wishing you could hold me, oh-oh
Can you hear me now?
I was trying, I was trying
But I'm no longer fighting, oh-oh
Can you hear me?

I hate it when you're high but I was on your side
Breathe it 'til it burns, it's not all about you
Grass beneath my feet, pulling on my teeth
Try to smile but it hurts, can't remember how to

Hey, Suzy, where you been today?
I'm looking for you every way
No sign of you when I wake up
I'm on an island with no sun

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like I've known you my whole life
You got me cryin' like when Aslan died
Now you're gone

[Chorus]
The melody can't find you
I'm incomplete without you
I guess we've reached the end of the game
Ooh, hit me

I know that you would crank this song
Air-guitaring with your headphones on
We dig the same type of melodies
The ones to get you next to me

I was Mick and you were Marianne (Marianne)
You would harmonize when I felt bad (I felt bad)
But now you're gone

12650,Did My Best,The Voidz,"[Intro]
Let me tell you a story
'Bout the hazy good old days

[Verse 1]
A change in the game, rules are for kids
Wanted to play but now I’m on the sideline
Watchin' everyone havin' so much fun
Never let 'em know you’re angrier than them
Ow, nobody cares about the days of old
Take a quick picture then you run home
Call my friends, no one picks up
I guess I’m going out all alone again
It’s time to grow up, but I don’t wanna calm down
Everything happens for a reason somehow
But, I know that’s not true, the meaning is just the same common purpose that I love but might not trust no more

[Bridge]
Oh, mama, how I miss those days
Watch them stream away, I wave
But they don’t wave back at me
Guess they’re just afraid, that they might get seen
Maybe afraid of what they wanna be
Some old freak like me, no

[Verse 2]
It all makes sense, prisoners of Earth
Listen to the stories from before your birth
Trainin' for the game, kiss him in the rain
Everything about it is so fuckin' insane
It’s been a long time, you never lost touch
Here comes an old witch with a poisoned apple
Bring it to me, I’ll take a bite
Every last piece until I lose the light, oh

[Break]
Rock and roll, rock and roll

[Chorus]
I can only change what I can change
I can only change what I can change
Meet me at the bottom
I can only change what I can change
I can only change what I can change
Meet me at the bottom
The lost years

[Outro]
I never think about those days everyone’s talking about
They were the best, I guess
You say you like the way I dress
But that gets me beat up
And now you see
That was the story of my youth
I hope it makes sense to you
'Cause it doesn’t make sense to me

And find a place to live life slow

Put our feet in the water
Dig our teeth in the sand
Let the sea take us farther
Just to see where we land

[Chorus]
And we can paint California
And pray the rain never shows up
We put our feet in the water
Dig our teeth in the sand
Let the sea take us farther
Just to see where we land

[Verse 2]
You see
I’ll turn the West Coast upside-down
As long as you say
That there's no better place like home
And you'll be my queen of the coral
I’ll be king of the sand
We'll blind enemies with our laurels
As they scream for our heads

[Chorus]
And we can paint California
And pray the rain never shows up
And you'll be my queen of the coral
I'll be king of the sand
We'll blind enemies with our laurels
As they scream for our heads

The smell of sensation has got my heart racing
I'm high of your fragrance
High as the Tower of Babylon, baby
Stains and graffiti, I know that they won't be
Mourning the pavement for long
La, la, lady, you got me stir-crazy
I hope the world's ready
For brushes we’re waving like scepters
We’re paining the walls of Sin City
Broken and pretty, it's yours for the taking

[Chorus]
And we can paint California
And pray the rain never shows up
We put our feet in the water
Dig our teeth in the sand
Let the sea take us farther
Just to see where we land

Not seeking sympathy (Nah), I just want all of this (Hey)
Hide under an umbrella (Yeah)
And try to shelter myself from the rain
Try to stop my head from goin’ insane
Counting down all the days
I swear that there's a bright side too
Being alone outside, they
Cannot suffocate me when they
Cannot fucking chase me out (Ayy)
Anagram all of the letters
They’re tellin' me that I'm gonna be fine
I climb the walls inside of my mind
Piece 'em together and jump off the sides
I might be alone tonight
If I try to stay alive and realise
I’m going blind

Against shadows and all doubts
And sail upon new winds

Gonna cross the great divide
Will you be by my side
When I reach for the stars
I know u-oh oh, I'll go u-oh oh
Go-o-o, oh oh oh oh oh

I can hear a voice within
I have to leave this town
Like a feather in the wind

Never hit the ground

Searching for my promised land
Against shadows and all doubts
Come and take my hand

Don't wait until it's too late

So we can be hollow

On my bakelite
Crawl down and see what they heard

Hollow out the sides

12715,Moment Of Surrender,U2,"[Verse 1]
I tied myself with wire
To let the horses run free
Playing with the fire
Until the fire played with me, mmm

[Verse 2]
The stone was semi-precious
And we were barely conscious
Two souls too smart to be
In the realm of certainty
Even on our wedding day

[Verse 3]
We set ourselves on fire
Oh God, do not deny her
It's not if I believe in love
If love believes in me
Oh, believe in me

[Chorus]
At the moment of surrender
I folded to my knees
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

[Verse 4]
I've been in every black hole
At the altar of the dark star
My body's now a begging bowl
That's begging to get back, begging to get back
To my heart
To the rhythm of my soul
To the rhythm of my unconsciousness
To the rhythm that yearns
To be released from control

[Chorus]
I was punching in the numbers
At the ATM machine
I could see in the reflection
A face staring back at me
At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I was speeding on the subway
Through the stations of the cross
Every eye looking every other way
Counting down till the pain will stop
At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

[Outro]
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls that hold me inside
I wanna reach out and touch the flame
Where the streets have no name (Ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter from the poison rain
Where the streets have no name, yeah (Oh, huh)

[Chorus]
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

[Verse 3]
The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust
I'll show you a place high on a desert plain (Yeah)
Where the streets have no name (Ah, ha)

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love

12717,Grace,U2,"[Verse 1]
Grace, she takes the blame
She covers the shame
Removes the stain, it could be her name
Grace, it's a name for a girl
It's also a thought that changed the world
And when she walks on the street you can hear the strings
Grace finds goodness in everything

[Verse 2]
Grace, she's got the walk
Not on a ramp or on chalk
She's got the time to talk
She travels outside of karma, karma
She travels outside of karma
When she goes to work you can hear her strings
Grace finds beauty in everything

[Verse 3]
Grace, she carries a world on her hips
No champagne flute for her lips
No twirls or skips between her fingertips
She carries a pearl in perfect condition
What once was hurt, what once was friction
What left a mark no longer stings
Because Grace makes beauty out of ugly things

Grace finds beauty in everything
Grace finds goodness in everything

Take it, I don't need it (I don't need it)
I don't wanna hear your motherfuckin' side
You can love it (You can love it)
Or you can leave it (Or you can leave it)
Because nothing I say and nothing I feel is right
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't understand
While I'm sitting up here dying, you're just holding out your hand
And even if I wanted to, I couldn't have explained
'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain

There's no denying it, you've never had control

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out

I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave)
It doesn't matter how much money I get paid
I give a shit (I give a shit), I never did (I never did)
So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin
If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear?
Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear?
If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere?
'Cause in the end, I'll never bend, I'll never shed a tear

There's no denying it, I've always had control

With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotise me through
Hypnotise me through

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora borealis comes in view

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Appearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you

I just ran, I ran all night and day
And I ran, I ran so far away

12740,Beautiful Day,U2,"[Verse 1]
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

[Verse 2]
You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

[Post-Chorus]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Bridge]
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

[Chorus]
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

[Verse 1]
You're begging me to go
Then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way
Or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me
I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love
And I'm chained to your side

When I'm losing control
Will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?
And when all this gets old
Will it still feel the same?
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer
I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders
You'll need me to hold

We are young
Heartache to heartache

So you can keep the sun 'cause I like the nighttime better

But with a needle and some thread, I've been keeping it together
Life's too short to be worried 'bout whatever
So you keep shining in the sun, but I like the nighttime better, yeah

12735,Have In Mind,Cetu Javu,"Weak grows your heart, patiently

Look about the countryside
Can't perceive anything to hide

Rivers from the mountainside
Become polluted, don't try to deny
Remember the times when fish were alive
And realize what you need in life

Before the tragedy, have in mind
Weak grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind

Doesn't matter what you feel
As long as the others make a great deal
Don't wait so long in offer assistance
And don't give up with your existence

Step by step, we thus get nearer
But our fair must be clearer
When the sun will not rise
We have lost our paradise

Weak, grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind
Weak, grows your heart, patiently
Before the tragedy, have in mind

Look around you
Is there anything you need?
If you follow our way
You'll pass one day

Have in mind, and don't forget

Feeling shit again
Haven't left my bed
Never brush my hair
And if you look me in the eyes you'll see that I don't care

[Verse 2]
You don't seem to understand
This candy floss made spacecraft
Took the dirt out from my brain
Threw them out to outer space

[Chorus]
Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is light years away
And all our worries, they're all gone

[Verse 3]
Let loose, we live only for a little while
In hindsight, we'll die anyways
Extraterrestrial beings probably sittin' tight
Waiting to blow our brains away

[Chorus]
Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is light years away
And all our worries, they're all gone

[Verse 4]
So quit being so negative
It's fine, don't be a temporary fix
You say I don't write happy songs
So I guess this is the first one

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is light years away
And all our worries, they're all gone

12733,Kiss of Love,Anything Box,"I felt the Sun on me
Made me see something I can't explain
Something in the wind calling my name
How is it possible?
I don't know
I don't know

When I held your hand
The same emotion enveloped me
Bizarre as it may seem
I thought I heard somebody say

Feel the kiss of love
Know that it's real, these emotions we feel
Feel the kiss of love
Know that it's true when it happens to you

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

When I think of you
The world takes new meaning and so does my life
Seems like paradise
Hopelessly, you and me at peace

I love you
I love everything

12727,Living in Oblivion,Anything Box,"You can't hide the pain
I can see it scrawled on your empty face
And I feel the hurt
It's in the words you say, they make me want to

Scream out to the world
For taking life for granted and I know
You are by my side
When I turn to hear you cry

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Am I so blind?
With my eyes turned to a different time or hour
At the end of the day
When we both run down and our hopes are heavy

Tell me what you will
'Cause I've got to know the truth inside of you
Can you hear what I say
When I hold you and you scorn the day?

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Living in oblivion
Living in oblivion

So I ask again
Am I so alone and full of pride?
To never speak out
This is my world, this is my world

Don't tell me now
I won't feel those words, I won't feel the lies they tell
Can you hear my scream?
It's for everyone, for everyone

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Living in oblivion
Living in oblivion

Don't take me down
'Cause I'm not done
Don't steal my crown
Before it's won

The wide expanse
The wheel of chance
Will turn my way
The sky will not be gray

Don't wanna wash my car
Don't wanna have to work

And don't let go
Trust this man
And let it flow

I drank at every bar in town
I filled my cup when I was down
Saw the things I wanted to see
Became the man I wanted to be
But then somehow I lost my way
I've got to get back there today

I don't wanna be
Like other people are
Don't wanna own a key
Don't wanna wash my car

Friends and liars
Don't wait for me

Under my heels
And still too close
To you, I feel

12713,Song For Someone,U2,"[Verse 1]
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

[Chorus]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone

[Verse 2]
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there, it's yours to take
I was told I'd feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

[Chorus]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don't let it go out
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
This is a song for someone

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I'm a long, long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out

In my heart
Is so much a part
Of who I am

Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years, a thousand years

Hold me close

Long before the night the stars went out
We're meeting up again

You took me by the hand
I thought that I was leading you
But it was you made me your man
Machine
I dream
Where you are
Iris standing in the hall
She tells me I can do it all
Iris wakes to my nightmares
Don't fear the world, it isn't there
Iris playing on the strand
She buries the boy beneath the sand
Iris says that I will be the death of her
It was not me

She says
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see yourself
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see

I don't want this, remember that
I'll never forget where you're at

I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time

But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields
Treated you bad, you bruise my face
Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste

Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
It should have been easier by three

If I'm on the wrong side of heaven
Then I know I won't be forgiven, ooh
Pray I'm accepted, plagued and infested
Preaching I'm the one to blame
Never said I'm perfect, I guess that makes me worthless

You're possessed and you slept through another day

All looking for a new place to drive
You sit beside me, so newly charming
Sweating dew drops glisten, freshing your side

And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

Way down the lane away, living for another day
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
Swim, seagull in the sky, towards that hollow western isle
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze

The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time

And the droning engine throbs in time

What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
To tear out from your eyes with a word to stiffen brooding lies
But I'll only watch you leave me further behind

And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time

The droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

I've started to fight

Well, any time, any place, anywhere that I go
All the people seem to stop and stare
They say, ""Why are you dressed like it's Halloween?
You look so absurd, you look so obscene""

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

Well, I let their teeny minds think
That they're dealing with someone who is over the brink
And I dress this way just to keep them at bay
'Cause Halloween is every day

12725,The Perfect Kiss,New Order,"[Verse 1]
I stood there beside myself
Thinking hard about the weather
Then came by a friend of mine
Suggested we go out together
Then I knew it from the start
This friend of mine would fall apart
Pretending not to see his gun
I said, ""Let's go out and have some fun""

[Chorus]
I know, you know, you believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love

[Verse 2]
I have always thought about
Staying here and going out
Tonight I should have stayed at home
Playing with my pleasure zone
He has always been so strange
I'd often thought he was deranged
Pretending not to see his gun
I said, ""Let's go out and have some fun""

[Chorus]
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love

[Verse 3]
When you are alone at night
You search yourself for all the things
That you believe are right
If you give it all away
You throw away your only chance to be here today
Then a fight breaks out on your street
You lose another broken heart in a land of meat
My friend, he took his final breath
Now I know the perfect kiss is the kiss of death

12707,Secret Smile,Semisonic,"[Chorus]
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

[Verse 1]
So use it and prove it
Remove this whirling of sadness
I'm losing, I'm bluesing
But you can save me from madness

[Chorus]
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

[Verse 2]
So save me, I'm waiting
I'm needing, hear me pleading
And soothe me, improve me
I'm grieving, I'm barely believing now, now

[Bridge 1]
When you are flying around and around the world
And I'm lying a-lonely
I know there's something sacred and free reserved
And received by me only

[Chorus]
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

[Chorus 1]
So use it and prove it
Remove this whirling of sadness
I'm losing, I'm bluesing
But you can save me from madness
Now, Now

When you are flying around and around the world
And I'm lying a-lonely
I know there's something sacred and free reserved
And received by me only

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile

[Outro]
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret

12712,Every Breaking Wave,U2,"[Verse 1]
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
And every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Verse 2]
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
But it's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Bridge]
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I'll go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

12708,Unwell,Matchbox Twenty,"[Verse 1]
All day
Starin' at the ceilin', makin'
Friends with shadows on my wall
All night
Hearin' voices tellin' me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on
Feelin' like I'm headed for a
Breakdown
And I don't know why

[Chorus]
But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

[Verse 2]
Me
I'm talkin' to myself in public
And dodgin' glances on the train
And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell

A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talkin' in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah, they're takin' me away

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell

But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see

But soon enough you're gonna think of me

Hey, how I used to be
How I used to be
Well, I'm just a little unwell
How I used to be
How I used to be
I'm just a little unwell

12709,The Man Who Sold The World,Nirvana,"[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face

Okay, but here's another one I could screw up

12744,Popular Monster,Falling In Reverse,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway
Everybody tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah
I battle with depression, but the question still remains
Is this post-traumatic stressing or am I suppressing rage?
And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay
Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searching for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular monster

[Verse 2]
I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze
Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I replace
I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace
How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case?
Oh my God, I keep on stressing, every second that I waste
Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take
But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage
Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay
Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention
I need to change a couple things 'cause something is missing
And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine
Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave
I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again
Crashed my car just to feel again
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searching for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular fucking monster

[Breakdown]
Yeah
Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh
We're sick and tired of wondering
Praying to a god that you don't believe
You're searching for the truth in the lost and found
So the question I ask is, yeah, where the fuck is your god now?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searching for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart

Look at your shoes
You hang names on your wall
Then you shoot them all
You fly around in planes
That bring you down
To meet me who loves you
Like me crashing to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you so lonely?
You don't even know me
But you'd like to stone me

[Chorus]
Mr Writer, why don't you tell it like it is?
Why don't you tell it like it really is
Why don't you tell it how it really is
Before you go on home?

I used to treat you right
Give you my time
But when I'd turn my back on you
Then you do what you do
You've just enough, in my own view
Education to perform
I'd like to shoot you all

And then you go home
With you on your own
What do you really know?

Mr Writer, why don't you tell it like it is?

Betrayed by words I'd never heard, too hard to say

12719,Tenderness,General Public,"I don't know when to start or when to stop
My luck's like a button
I can't stop pushing it
My head feels light
But I'm still in the dark
Seems like without tenderness
There's something missing

Tenderness
Where is the
Tenderness?
Where is it?

I don't know where I am, but I know I don't like it
I open my mouth, and out pops something spiteful
Words are so cheap, but they can turn out expensive
Words like conviction can turn into a sentence

I held your hands
Rings but none on that finger
We danced and danced
But I was scared to go much further with it
Just half a chance
Make sure that one night you're here but
Next night you're not
It always leaves me searching for a little

Tenderness
Where is the
Tenderness?
Where is the
Tenderness?

Whistling in the graveyard
Calling up your girlfriend
Just trying to make her understand
You're squeezing the telephone like it was her hand
No question (so many questions)
She's going to catch you out, boy
It all seems so underhand
Now she's the only thing that ever made
You feel like a man, man, madman, madman

Tenderness
Where is the
Tenderness?
Tenderness
Tenderness
Where is it?

I held your hands
Rings but none on that finger
We danced and danced
But I was scared to go much further with it
Just half a chance
Make sure that one night you're here but
Next night you're not
It always leaves me searching for a little

Tenderness
Where is the
Tenderness?

When you're sick to death of second best, pet
Why should the morning always find you unimpressed?
Is your love like a button?
You can't stop pushing it?
Oh this all-night longing can be such a long time

And come running to my open arms
When will you realise?
Do we have to wait till our worlds collide?
Open up your eyes
You can't turn back the tide

A search that shall remain
We asked you what you'd seen
You said you didn't care

Sound formed in a vacuum may seem a waste of time
It's always been just the same

You've caught me at a bad time
So, why don't you piss off?

Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin

I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time to see
If you're lost in hell, you'll find no peace
Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

That's what you do best

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now

Many would believe it
Stand up and resist the chains

Oh, you're a lie and a fake
I hope the truth is not too late

Nobody does it better than the enemy

[Verse 1]
No you’re not gonna waste my time
No you’re not gonna change my mind
No I’m not your bottom line
This runs deeper than dollar signs
Every deal with the devil’s the same
They all want credit but nobody takes blame
Dark money games
Selling me the same old lie with a different name
Same shit, different day
This tired old song is so overplayed
From New York City back to LA
Welcome to the masquerade

I’m caught in the
I’m caught in the crossfire
Dancing on a tripwire
Throwing up a toast to the end of the world (The world)
Preaching to a deaf choir

Better keep your hopes high and head down low
In the crossfire

[Verse 2]
Now you want me to change my name
Now you want me to change my face
Now you want me to learn my place
But I’d rather learn from my mistakes
Gotta fight just to tell the truth
Gotta steal just to make it new
I never knew, it takes a hit
To find out you're bulletproof

Watching all bridges burn

12766,History of Violence,Theory of a Deadman,"[Intro]
The city's on fire
The streets are a riot
Now look at this place, no one is safe
No one is safe from you

[Verse 1]
So beautiful, she knew it every single day
Got a smile that left him right around the way
Yeah, it makes you feel good, wondering why she stays
So afraid, afraid of you
She need a sedative to get her straight
You know she need a cigarette, she got the shakes
Put them sunglasses on to hide her face
Such a waste, a waste on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, why are you ashamed?
Too scared to run away
You love him anyway
Surviving just on the pain

Maybe the way out is a .38
God gave her a sign, not a moment late
Tonight, she's gonna point it at his fucking face
Then bang, he's blown away

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, why are you ashamed?
Too scared to run away
You love him anyway

Tell me where she went wrong

No one is safe from you

[Verse 3]
Still in shock from the blast, sure the neighbors heard it
Now or never, crossed a man and it wasn't worth it
No regrets from what the judge calls a bad decision
Now she's doing twenty years in a women's prison
Yeah, she'll never have her life, will she feel at all?
She'll never know what it's like not to feel alone
No kids that will love her unconditional
No cure for a sickness that's medicinal
She flying high in her cell, she can finally breathe
She flying high outta hell, now she finally free
Man, he fed her to the lions, that monster
He promised her diamonds for silence
It's the history of violence

The city's on fire
The streets are a riot
Now look at this place, no one is safe
No one is safe from you

(You're a disgrace of the disease)
We are the voices and we reject you
(And we reject you, and we reject you)

[Chorus]
Misery loves the company
Apathy is feeding the machine
Carried in the heart of kings and queens
Misery loves the company
Apathy is feeding the machine
Carried in the heart of kings and queens
And we are the disease, we are the disease

We are the disease
We are the disease
Yeah, we are the disease

12762,Can You Hear Me,Korn,"[Verse 1]
It walks with me, it takes its time
It sinks its teeth in one at a time
It loves to feed, it loves my past
It's always taunting but somehow out of grasp

[Chorus]
Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost
And I may never come back again
And while my heart keeps holding on
I know I'll never be the same again

[Verse 2]
It talks to me, it holds my hand
It showers me with things I can't understand
It has no reason, it knows no time
It's constantly watching, so it's not left behind

[Chorus]
Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost
And I may never come back again
And while my heart keeps holding on
I know I'll never be the same again
Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost
And I may never come back again
And while my heart keeps holding on
I know I'll never be the same again

You know I'll never be the same again (You know, you know)
You know I'll never be the same again (You know, you know)

I know I'll never be the same again
I know I'll never be the same again
I know I'll never be the same again

12772,Native Son,Alter Bridge,"[Verse 1]
Fate, giver of life now is all but dead and gone
Pain, left to die in blood-drenched fields or driven off

[Pre-Chorus]
Now nothing remains
A ritual tamed
What's taken away
We will never replace, no

[Chorus]
Now I'm a native son in a foreign land
And I'm just living in a world I can't understand

[Verse 2]
Time marching forward brings a slow and cruel decay
As I fight for the heritage so many died to save

[Pre-Chorus]
Now nothing remains
A ritual tamed
What's taken away
We will never replace

[Chorus]
Now I'm a native son in a foreign land
And I'm just living in a world I can't understand

[Bridge]
Fractured and cut off from all we had
Severed all that's sacred, now we stand
Strangers left to wander this strange land

[Chorus]
Now I'm a native son in a foreign land
And I'm just living in a world I can't understand
I look around and see that my world is gone
Still I keep trying to fit in where I don't belong

Under the black and inside the blue
A bone thick spell has washed away
It took some time but I realized
The obstacle's the only way
Under the black and inside the blue
A bone thick spell has washed away
It took some time but I realized
The obstacle's the only way

[Verse 1]
(The guinea pigs of a generation)
An experiment to be improved on
(A story for them all to tell)
A history of forced intrusion
They pricked me but I didn't bleed
They singed me just to test the smell
They cut me but I didn't feel
I was just too deep in to fail

You think you know what you want
Until you're inside the nest
You got it all figured out
Until you're drowning in it
You think you know who you are
Until you're under duress

Until you're under the skin

Now I'm in the lion's den

Bred to self-induced entrapment
I'm the one who lacked the discipline

12774,The Violence,Asking Alexandria,"[Verse 1]
Open up, drink it in, don't ask too many questions
Become the vessel for the shame they feed you through suggestion
There's a rumor on the breeze, secrets that bring you to your knees
We made the problem, we are the poison, whoa
Close your eyes, surrender your beliefs to them for holding
Wait patiently to hear what ever-changing lines are showing
There's a whisper in the wind, eventual storm that's rolling in
They have the answers, cure for the cancer we've become
That we've become

[Chorus]
All they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us
We'll bring on the violence, the violence

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, daily take apart what you've been building (Building)
Everything you have is to be fed into the system
There's a force out pushing fear, a deafening silence drawing near
Sit, absorb it, guess we've been toxic all along, all along

[Chorus]
All they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us
We'll bring on the violence, the violence (The violence)
To plant their seeds and divide us (The violence)
If they want the worst that's inside us (The violence)
We'll bring on the violence, the violence

I'm on the edge and I'm not alone
Remember this is what you asked for
I'm on the edge and I'm not alone
Remember this is what you asked for

All you wanted was violence
To plant your seeds and divide us
You want the worst that's inside us
We'll bring on the violence, the violence (The violence)
We'll fall before you divide us (The violence)
If you want the worst that's inside us (The violence)
Bring on the violence, the violence

Try to find my stride, but I trip and I fall
Losing my attention again
Yeah, I hit the bottom, but I'm on the mend

I get up
Take another step, push it to the edge
I get up
Just a little more, I can see the end

You think too much, it's in my head
So I'm shaking off the rust and
You got no trust, it's in my head
So I'm shaking off the rust

Walked through the fire, made it back again
Lord knows I tried everything I can
Now I'm shaking off the rust

Bang my head against the wall
Try to hold a smile, but I'm sick of it all
Everyone with something to say
Better hold my tongue or I'll make my mistake

Show 'em what I do, show 'em how it's done

12779,All I Had To Lose,Mark Morton,"[Verse 1]
We were reckless for a season now
Restless with a reason
I can't tell
I can't tell
If we were victims of the vices or
Addicted to the crisis
Live through hell
Live through hell

[Chorus]
And when you came up for a breath
I knew there wasn't nothing left to do but choose
And everything I lost wasn't much compared to all
I had to, I had to lose

[Verse 2]
We laid with the dead and dying
Told them all we were just trying
To be alive
To be alive
Closed our eyes and hoped that we could leave
The lives we didn't want to lead behind
Behind

And when you came up for a breath
I knew there wasn't nothing left to do but choose
And everything I lost wasn't much compared to all
I had to lose

[Bridge]
Watch the colors fade away
Bleached out by the sun
Left hope for another day
Prayed it would never come

And when you came up for a breath
I knew there wasn't nothing left to do but choose
And everything I lost wasn't much compared to all
I had to, I had to lose
I had to lose
I had to lose

12770,Every Second,From Ashes to New,"[Verse 1: Chris Musser]
I'm broken, I'm hoping for a reason to keep on going
Doors open and closing, everything seems like slow motion
I've chosen this moment to stop my self-erosion
I'm focused on owning, myself – my own opponent

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Musser]
But in this moment that is falling apart, I keep thinking
Is the path I've chosen where I should start I keep sinking?

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
I'm dying every second I'm alive, every second I'm alive
I'm trying to feed the fire that's inside, feed the fire that's inside
I'm dying every second I'm alive, this life's reflection in my eyes
Reminds me the scars made me stronger

[Verse 2: Chris Musser]
I won't go quietly, won't let the past confine me
I don't know why I see what I've tried to put behind me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Musser]
But in this moment that is falling apart, I keep thinking
Is the path I chose where I should start I keep sinking?

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
I'm dying every second I'm alive, every second I'm alive
I'm trying to feed the fire that's inside, feed the fire that's inside
I'm dying every second I'm alive, this life's reflection in my eyes
Reminds me the scars made me stronger

[Verse 3: Matt Brandyberry]
Every second I'm alive I'm getting closer to my grave
I've tried my best to just survive, feels like I'm broken every day
I'm hoping that I make it, I'm open but I'm vacant
I'm closed inside this basement, time to try to fight to shake it
I'm shaking and I'm waiting, still debating on which way to go
I'm swaying and I'm fading, no escaping, still afraid to know
Inside my thoughts are racing so I'm bracing for a weighted stone
The world that's on my shoulders that I may just have to change alone

[Chorus: Chris Musser]
I'm dying every second I'm alive, every second I'm alive
I'm trying to feed the fire that's inside, feed the fire that's inside
I'm dying every second I'm alive, this life's reflection in my eyes
Reminds me the scars made me stronger

12752,Already Dead,Hollywood Undead,"[Verse 1: J-Dog]
It's the year of the snake
Friends are overrated, so let's make no mistake
I watch from the distance while you poison the lake
A trail of ash that you leave in your wake
Knock me down, but I get back up
In the rain, I feel no pain from the cuts
Too much pain, is it ever enough?
In the rain and I'm spilling my guts

[Chorus: Danny]
You wanna hate me
You wanna try and break me
But you can't kill me
'Cause I'm already dead
You can shame me
You could try and break me down
'Cause I'm already dead

Already dead
Already dead

Here I am again at the edge of a knife
Some of us are born at the end of our lives
Wake up in a sweat in the dead of the night
I must be dreaming
I can see the end of your reign
I can feel the hate filling your veins
Watch me now as I'm breaking the chains
Leaving your whole empire in flames

You wanna hate me
You wanna try and break me
But you can't kill me

You can shame me
You could try and break me down

12756,Talking Myself In Circles,Four Year Strong,"Talk is cheap
You caught me on another losing streak
I wish you didn't have to watch me bleed
As I pick up all the pieces that are left of me

Trying to look on the upside
But maybe I'm upside down

I tried to fill the space between us
When we were more than just a couple miles apart
Get a map, draw a line that connects you and I
And follow it to the end to start all over again

I keep repeating the same thing without any meaning
(Without any meaning)
Just hoping that it takes me back to the beginning
I just keep talking myself in circles
Talking round and round in circles

What's with the attitude
How about a little bit of gratitude
Forgive my sweet and sour point of view
'Cause I already know the truth of what you think of me

Trying to look on the bright side
Maybe I'm just burnt out

I tried to fill the space between us
When we were more than just a couple miles apart
Get a map, draw a line that connects you and I
And follow it to the end to start all over again

I keep repeating the same thing without any meaning
(Without any meaning)
Just hoping that it takes me back to the beginning
Trying to look on the bright side
Maybe I'm just burnt out

I keep repeating the same thing without any meaning

Just hoping that it takes me back to the beginning
I just keep talking myself in circles
Talking round and round in circles
Talking round and round
Just hoping that it takes me back to the beginning

Don't know how much more of this I can take
'Cause anger's so much easier
Than fixing everything I can't face

I'm stuck inside the madness, I know you've felt this
But I know we'll make it out somehow
It's like a war from within just to let go
Killing ourselves to cope
Inside the sadness, sometimes it traps us

Another cure that doesn't work for me
Darkness and anxiety

Losing myself in all this crowd

12784,When the Contagion Is You,Jasta,"[Verse 1]
I'm looking down at shaking hands
They belong to a different man
He's changing fast and I've been thinking
About this place and all its demons
So much to gain, so much to lose
Different paths that we must choose
You weren't there but I hope you know
Holding on hurts more than letting go

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes holding on hurts more than letting go
I've been there before and now I know

[Chorus]
Now after all we've seen
Through veils of apathy
We try to gain new ground
And watch our demons drown
Control slips through the cracks
I feel myself detach
Time can't heal every wound
When the contagion is you

[Verse 2]
This rotted heart inside a cage
Beating hard and bound in chains
Hatred flows through arteries
Colder blood and hardened veins
Although alike, we're not the same
No choices left but to change
I see in you what I can't become
Holding on hurts more than letting go

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes holding on hurts more than letting go
The only way to heal is to let go

[Chorus]
Now after all we've seen
Through veils of apathy
We try to gain new ground
And watch our demons drown
Control slips through the cracks
I feel myself detach
Time can't heal every wound
When the contagion is you

[Post-Chorus]
There's no cure
When the contagion is you

[Bridge]
Time, searching for the answers
Can't cut away the cancer
Heal, wounds still open
I'm here, barely fucking coping
I need to just let go
Can't look into the rearview
Hold you up any longer
If it doesn't make me stronger

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes holding on hurts more than letting go
Letting go
There's no cure when the contagion is you

[Chorus]
Now after all we've seen
Through veils of apathy
We try to gain new ground
And watch our demons drown
Control slips through the cracks
I feel myself detach
Time can't heal every wound
When the contagion is you
Now after all we've seen
Through veils of apathy
We try to gain new ground
And watch our demons drown
Control slips through the cracks
I feel myself detach
Time can't heal every wound
When the contagion is you
"
12781,Her Eyes,Fame on Fire,"You held me down and took control
You told me count my blessings
You took advantage of my soul
I should’ve learned my lesson
But I’m so messed up
(I can feel It, I can feel It in my bones)
I just want your touch
(I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna be alone)
(Even though she’s lovely)
I can see the devil in her eyes
I think ima stay for the night
Hope she doesn’t take over my mind
Will I even make it out alive?
No I can’t take this anymore
I know I’m the problem
I keep on coming back for more
Cause you are a goddess
I can save you, If you let me try
I can see through, all the bullshit lies
I won’t let him, take control inside
Its enough now cause the
The devil is alone tonight

Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee

I thought that I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, ""John, go do My will""

Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Through everyday
I’m facing all my faults
All alone
No way home
Afraid to lose it all

I open my eyes and now I realize I’m just the game
Torn away from my home, left me crawling
Everything is falling
Now I’m the hunted

On your face
A thousand ways
To kill me where I stand
Scarred again
There’s no end

Close enough to rendezvous
You come to me and then you slip right through

Left me in the afterglow
Till I'm falling through space and time

You got your missiles flying through the air tonight
And it's alright‚ alright

But I never thought of this
Stuck in this state‚ misaligned
Trapped inside the looking glass
Tell me when will all this pass
Oh, how I hate the silver line
Never could taste your life
Never my place and time
Left behind
Never your state of mind
Never in phase with mine

12791,Masochist,Polaris,"[Intro]
This is a place I know too well
Been down here a while if you can't tell
And I have analysed and tried my best to justify
The sorrow I have brought upon myself

[Chorus]
Am I addicted to the misery? Is this how I'll always be?
Grinding the salt into every wound
Am I in love with all my ailments, glutton for punishment?
You can't trust me to be there for you

[Verse 1]
I thought I had this, I thought I had this all figured out
You'd think I'd learned from all the shit I fucking screamed about
When there was sun, I couldn't see for the clouds
Still climbing the walls of this well just to dive back down
Until I reached my rock bottom
Down to the marrow, bringing up the bad blood I'd forgotten
Is it me that's making me sick?
Been burning both ends of the wick

[Chorus]
Am I addicted to the misery? Is this how I'll always be?
Grinding the salt into every wound
Am I in love with all my ailments, glutton for punishment?
You can't trust me to be there for you
I've got this cold black silhouette hanging like a marionette
Casting a shadow, a shade over me
Just a sick, sad, sorry mess, living like a masochist
Your worst impressions were right about me
Your worst impressions were right about me
Your worst impressions were right

[Bridge]
I could ask you to stay if you're feeling forgiving
I could live with the guilt if you call this living
I could try to memorise each grain of sand
As it slips through my fingers and falls from my hands
It took me longer than I'd care to admit
This life is only what I choose to make of it
And the only thing standing in between happiness and myself
Was this depression I held so close to my chest

[Chorus]
Am I addicted to the misery? Is this how I'll always be?
Grinding the salt into every wound
Am I in love with all my ailments, glutton for punishment?
You can't trust me to be there for you
I've got this cold black silhouette hanging like a marionette
Casting a shadow, a shade over me
Just a sick, sad, sorry mess, living like a masochist
Your worst impressions were right about me

Wasting a waning youth
Waiting for something to help me pull through
I never saw the sun through the clouds
I lost faith when the skies were falling down

Lost in the wind, without a direction
Possessed by perfection
In this land, if you're awake, you're the enemy
I run away in search of redemption
A path to ascension
Like an elevator rising to the sun

I scream at the stars
But nobody's listening
Searching for the end, but
The journey's the reason for existence
It's tearing at my heart
The secret's in the distance
Hard to find the truth in the dark
When you're begging for forgiveness

Scorched by the rays, my quest is relentless
My spirit is desperate
To find comfort in the arms of her remedy
Chasing a face, that has no reflection
The lights of salvation
Disappear into the shadows of the sand

I scream at the stars
But nobody's listening
Searching for the end, but
The journey's the reason for existence

If we all take a second and listen
Voice of reason is how we can end this
We can't waste a minute
It needs to happen now
Drop your weapons and all your defences
Drop your pride get the point that we're missing
We can't waste a minute
It needs to happen now
It needs to happen now

Tear down
These walls
Well this can't go on forever
Something's gotta give
Burn down
And relearn
Well we won't be here forever
Something's gotta change
Right now

12849,Backseat Boogie,Airbourne,"Find a sweet spot, put it in park
It don't even matter if it's light or dark
Follow my lead, give you what you need
Fogging up the windows, have you beggin' me, please
Get the horn honking, get your boots knocking
Top of the mountain above the city lights
Rolling up a smoke, cheap bottle of wine

Backseat boogie
Hot on the beat
Backseat boogie
Turn up the heat
Hoochie coochie
Know what I mean
Backseat boogie
Do it with me

We could go to the show or just ride around
Stay up all night and never get found
From the north to south, the west to the east
Bouncing to the rhythm of the bumble bees
Roll the windows up, get the rock rockin'
On top of the mountain above the city lights
Rolling up a smoke, cheap bottle of wine

Backseat boogie
Hot on the beat
Backseat boogie
Turn up the heat

Know what I mean

In the backseat
In the backseat do it with me

12841,The Safety of Disbelief,Light The Torch,"[Intro]
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly

[Verse 1]
There's nothing left that we can say
Nothing gold can ever stay
It's easier to run away
It's easier to curse than pray

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No sacrifice, now burn it at the altar

[Chorus 1]
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the safety of disbelief

You want to lay your doubt aside
Faith has nowhere left to hide
I'm the one with hollow eyes
I'm the one you now despise

[Chorus 2]
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the way that you bleed for me
Return to the safety of disbelief

For you and all your dreams
I feel nothing

And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the way that you bleed for me

12814,Tear You Down,Clawfinger,"You’ve got white teeth, clean suits
Straight ties and crooked roots
You can never hide where you’re coming from
You can never deny that the damage is done
You can polish a turd and try to make things fit
But a pile of shit is still a pile of shit
When reality hits and we call your bluff
Then you better get ready cos’ it’s gonna get rough

I’m gonna tear you down, I’m gonna crack your crown
I’m gonna shake your ground, until you can’t take any more

You’ve got fake news, false facts
Fucking lies and criminal pacts
You’re as rotten as the history that you come from
You refuse to admit you’re doing anything wrong
You stand your ground and defend your fight
Even though you can’t win you pretend your right
No matter what you do when all is said and done
The battle you’re fighting, it can’t be won

I’m gonna tear you down, I’m gonna crack your crown
I’m gonna shake your ground, until you can’t take any more

The lights on but nobody’s at home
You’re a few bones short of a backbone
If you didn’t exist neither would this song
If I agreed with you then we’d both be wrong

I’m gonna tear you down, I’m gonna crack your crown
I’m gonna shake your ground, until you can’t take any more
I’m gonna tear you down, I’m gonna tear you down
Until you can’t take any more

12806,Another Life,Any Given Sin,"Fight to climb the spire
Just to reach a funeral pyre
Where plans and schemes
And hopes and dreams lay on the fire

And so becomes the world
A clouded string of pearls
Where trumpets ring
And choirs sing of lost believers

But I feel the power inside
A force that fails to hide
From shattered dreams and lies
Is what I’ve owed repaid

You can break me down the way it is
I’ll find another life
Somewhеre on the other sidе
You can break me down the pain it ends
I’ll shine another light somewhere on the other side

Familiar are the wounds
So often licked to soon
As pages turned and lessons learned
Are all but fleeting

But then there shines a light
The beacon in the night
To guide you home to take your throne
You lost believer

But I feel the power inside
A force that fails to hide
From shattered dreams and lies

Is what I’ve known betrayed

You can break me down the way it is
I’ll find another life
Somewhere on the other side
You can break me down the pain it ends
I’ll shine another light somewhere on the other side

I’ll find I’ll find I’ll find another life
Ill shine I’ll shine I’ll shine another light

You can break me down the way it is
I’ll find another life
Somewhere on the other side
You can break me down the pain it ends
I’ll shine another light somewhere on the other side

12822,Alone,Of Virtue,"[Verse 1]
Do you ever find it hard to realize the difference
Between fate and destiny?
All that happens in your life doesn't happen for a reason
It’s all the choices that you make, come on

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you're in over your head
Making you feel like you're drowning, looking for a hand to reach
""I know you need me in your life to get where you are going
But you’re starting to think differently""

God, I'm feeling like you left me on my own
God, I'm feeling like someone you'll never know
Not calling out again, not following your plan
God, I'm feeling like I'm better off alone

I’m on my knees thinking: “This is how it’s gotta be
You're not getting anything else from me""

Between fate and destiny?

To the questions you never had

12805,Black Flag Army,HELLYEAH,"[Verse 1]
We've spent our lives left out in the rain
As you stand dry behind the windowpane
Don’t try to understand us, you have no clue (Clue)
So I took a bat and I broke the glass
You're exclusive but you have no class
Never been first, but we're built to last
We’re not afraid of you
Born to make you uncomfortable
Our hate is unconditional
Coexistence is impossible
And we're coming for you

[Chorus]
We're the black flag army, the militia of truth
Raise your black flag, pledge allegiance to our roots
We're the black flag army, demolition crew
You just lean on me, and I'll lean back on you

[Verse 2]
You spent your life sheltered in the shade
We stood in the ruins as the fires blazed
You tried to dull our shine, but we refused
So I took a knife and I made the cut
Million-dollar smile that you can't stitch up
You're the diamonds and we're the rust
Choke you with your silver spoon
We’re caustic and we’re flammable
We're feral motherfucking animals
Our fists are up, we’re unstoppable
And we've got a gift for you

[Chorus]
We're the black flag army, the militia of truth
Raise your black flag, pledge allegiance to our roots
We're the black flag army, demolition crew
You just lean on me, and I’ll lean back on you

[Post-Chorus]
Raise your black flag and terrorize
Raise your black flag, no compromise
Raise your black flag, we're under siege
Raise your black flag and stand together with me

[Bridge]
We're the black flag army, the militia of truth
Raise your black flag, pledge allegiance to our roots
We're the black flag army, demolition crew
You just lean on me, and I'll lean back on you

[Chorus]
We're the black flag army, the militia of truth
Raise your black flag, pledge allegiance to our roots
We're the black flag army, demolition crew
You just lean on me, and I'll lean back on you

[Post-Chorus]
Raise your black flag and terrorize
Raise your black flag, no compromise
Raise your black flag, we're under siege
Raise your black flag and stand together with me

12837,Crooked Soul,Dayseeker,"[Verse 1]
I think I have a problem
These blackened eyes are bloodshot
Lust like a fiend, I don't feel
What you feel for anyone or anything
Broken but I don't need, I don't need you to fix me
Numb to the pain, I could drown in the rain
My demon's safe, kept in my grave

[Pre-Chorus]
Drunk off mistakes, addicted to the everlasting hell
So I take another drink, throw up in the sink
The darker that it gets the easier I can breathe

[Chorus]
If I have a heart, why am I so cold?
If you love me, still, I don't feel it
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul
(That I'd become a crooked soul)

[Verse 2]
I see a devil in myself, inflicting all the grief and doubt
I don't feel (Feel anything)

[Pre-Chorus]
Drunk off mistakes, addicted to the everlasting hell
So I take another drink, throw up in the sink
The darker it gets the easier I can breathe

[Chorus]
If I have a heart, why am I so cold?
If you love me, still, I don't feel it
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul
Don't need your help, time will tell
My only concern is myself
I always knew in the end
That I'd become a crooked soul

[Bridge]
Don't need your help, time will tell, I see a devil in myself
I see the devil in myself
Lust like a fiend, I don't feel
What you feel
For anyone or anything

[Chorus]
If I have a heart, why am I so cold?
If you love me, still, I don't feel it
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul
Don't need your help, time will tell, my only concern is myself
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul

Crooked soul
I see a devil in myself

I'm gonna meet my friends out on the ledge
We've pushed it to the edge
We're water under the bridge
The party's over, I can hear the bells toll
Now the crack of doom shines on us all

Sabotage, dehumanize
Gonna smash it up, annihilation time

You're just a mayfly, baby

12821,Come Around,Papa Roach,"[Verse 1]
In between a rock and a hard place
Trying to find your way through the dark days
But you don't know how
You flipped the world upside down
And right now you don't wanna show it
'Cause you don't think that anyone will notice
Until you tell someone
You'll feel like you're the only one

And everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright
Everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright

[Chorus]
I know we're not alright

I know your silence is a deadly sound
It's never easy when you're breaking down
But I'll be there when you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
Face down in the days that we wasted
Trying to find our way through the mazes
We could wait this out
Or walk through that fire somehow
You trying to put together all the pieces
When you should turn around now and leave 'em
'Cause you could lose your mind
Trying to live back in time

[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright
Everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright

[Chorus]
I know we're not alright
It's always darkest just before the light
I know your silence is a deadly sound
It's never easy when you're breaking down
But I'll be there when you come around
When you come around, yeah

I know we're not alright
It's always darkest just before the light
I know your silence is a deadly sound
It's never easy when you're breaking down

12803,Upside Down,Bonesteel,"Oh my, what have I found?
So innocent, an angel down
Are you alone?
Where did you come from?
How many days have you been away?

Follow my lead

Dancing in a grave
Deep below the ground
You seem so beautiful
When you’re upside down

So cold, stay by my side
The warmth of your blood melts all the ice
You look at me like I’m your savior
And I bow to you like you’re the same

Pull me closer

Dancing in a grave
Deep below the ground
You seem so beautiful
When you’re upside down


As they danced into the abyss
They mourned not for their consciousness
They found warmth within the void of light
For the first time, they felt alive

Dancing in a grave
(in a grave)
You seem so beautiful
(so beautiful)

Falling from grace
Eternal embrace
Upside Down
A silent ballet
Together we lay
Upside Down

Out of the ashes, a brave new world

All for one and one for all

I’m sick of waiting and waiting
Feeling lower than yesterday
When the earth is my hell
And I'm trapped in a cell
Will I ever get a break?

Please show me a sign
'Cause I’ve tried everything
To get me through this (Get me through this)

I can't keep running away
Running away
From me

My feet keep slipping
And I'm losing my balance again
Can't get a grip
Can't get a hold of the state that I'm in

On my shoulders
Keep slipping away
Keep slipping away

When the matches strike and the gasoline lights
It's only just begun
One thing I learned is you can watch it all burn
But the flame ain't ever done

Ooh, Raise 'em up a little higher, your lighters

Ain't no power higher
We're the outlaws and outsiders
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 2: Ivan Moody & Travis Tritt]
I was born in the dark with a fearless heart
And a taste for the other side
I was a crazy-ass kid, all the shit I did

But you know I never will
Takes too much time to walk a straight line
I don't have time to kill

But soon the devil will come
You know just why he wants you, don't you?

You touch it, you break it, you kill it
Just like a cureless cancer

Frozen in time
When the world is moving at the speed of light
Trapped inside these walls, you can't rise until you fall
And start to trust your heart over your mind
A diamond turned to stone
From the fear of falling into the great unknown
You're trapped in endless nights, you've lost the will to fight
Like a lantern that's lost its glow

[Chorus]
You're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
(Paralyzed, afraid to take the leap)

These chains grow stronger with time
But they can still be broken, you're not alone in this fight
Trapped inside these shells
The best version of ourselves is waiting to escape this hell

You're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach

12831,Save Defiance,Mark Morton,"[Verse 1: Myles Kennedy]
Into the last refrain, as your empire falls
World in decay, your back's against the wall
Tell me now, is it too late?
Tell me now, who’ll pay the cost?
For all the times you've disengaged
Tomorrow could be lost

[Pre-Chorus: Myles Kennedy]
Stop what you started
Open your eyes
The truth is the hardest thing to deny

[Chorus: Myles Kennedy]
Save defiance and hope you've got one last shot
Blood of tyrants running cold, they will never stop
Save defiance, you alone will resist in time
Break alliance to behold shifting paradigms

[Verse 2: Myles Kennedy]
There is no time to waste
This you can’t deny
The truth you embraced was only just a lie
Now do you see you're betrayed?
Now you must keep your resolve
Or everything you sacrificed to keep will forever be dissolved

[Pre-Chorus: Myles Kennedy]
Stop what they started
Open your eyes
They're reaping the harvest and bleeding you dry

[Chorus: Myles Kennedy]
Save defiance and hope you've got one last shot
Blood of tyrants running cold, they will never stop
Save defiance, you alone will resist in time
Break alliance to behold shifting paradigms

[Bridge: Myles Kennedy]
This is your season
Take heed and rise
The battle has started
(With your back against the wall)
Fight for your life
(Back against the wall, back against the wall, back against the wall)

Save defiance and hope you've got one last shot
Blood of tyrants running cold, they will never stop
Save defiance, you alone will resist in time
Break alliance to behold shifting paradigms

Are we just sick? (Sick)
Are we just tired? (Tired)
Apathetic, uninspired
What's to believe in, there's nobody leading

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me what's real
I don't know if I can feel

[Chorus]
All that we have is just slipping away
And I don't believe that it's gonna be okay
You can't stop the bleeding, it's almost too late
You're leaving us all behind with hell to pay

[Verse 2]
All of the dearly beloved
Your time is up, they're out for blood
Misery made us so hopelessly faithless (Hey)
And now I can't believe (Hey) a single word that you say (Say)
Secrets kept, a thin disguise, empty threats are full of lies (Hey)
Do what you will, you just add to your bill now

I can't escape you
No matter how far I run (Can't escape you)
I can't erase you
From who I've become (You're a part of me)
Memories coursing through my veins
Like the scars in yours, my roots remain

[Chorus]
I was raised in hell
I made it out by myself
I was raised to bleed
Bad blood runs wild and free
Bad blood runs wild and free
Bad blood runs wild and free

[Verse 2]
I thought you were dreaming (I thought you were dreaming)
Eyes rolled to the stars
Sinking slowly in muddy water
Set beneath the tar, you left me in the dark

[Bridge]
We grew up scared, bruised and battered
Youth torn and tattered
As long as you were sky high
Nothing fucking mattered
Hotel homes in the Cross
Under the bridge and lost
With your heads in the clouds above
You call this love?
You call this love?

[Chorus]
I was raised in hell
I made it out by myself
I was raised to bleed
Bad blood runs wild and free

I thought you were dreaming (Hell raised me)

Bad blood runs wild and free
Bad blood runs wild and free

Count down the thunder
I think we're too close for comfort
So no, don't rock the boat and don't calm the storm
God already gave you His answer
Blink, I'm sorry, it's over, the whistle's been blown, I
Think you got the wrong number, I'm breaking up
Wanna make a connection, can't get no reception
Leave a message after the tone

Don't move a muscle
No, we can't have a struggle
But the situation is in control
So play pretend that it's all good
You could tell the Messiah
His pants are on fire, I politely decline, I
I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand
And block out all the sadness, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Who the hell died and made you the king?
We don't know what we want, but we know that we want it

12823,Numb,A Killer's Confession,"All lies have come full circle
Your ignorance is all your own
You left me forsaken
You left me on my own

But now I walk this
But now I walk this path for so long
But this road has been a really long
I can't get back home

But the life of the damned
Has left in my hands
A world full of pain
One look from your eyes
And I realize I am not the same
I can’t explain
I won't explain
The man that I am
With this blood on my hands
I have become so numb

With every thousand tries that end with sorrow
Even when the sun doesn’t rise there is tomorrow
To believe in demise will open your eyes
You will seek you will find
That something greater than yourself
The hand that's out when you're screaming for help
To know that it's never alone
Such emptiness
Trying to find my way home

But the life of the damned
Has left in my hands
A world full of pain
One look from your eyes
And I realize I am not the same
I can’t explain
I won't explain
The man that I am
With this blood on my hands
I have become so numb
So numb
So numb
So numb

All lies have come full circle
Your ignorance is your own

But the life of the damned
Has left in my hands
A world full of pain
One look from your eyes
And I realize I am not the same
I can’t explain
I won't explain
The man that I am
With this blood on my hands
I have become so numb

So alive yet dead inside, but no-one tried to warn her
The tourniquets were cut & pasted, odour free and painless
Ghosts that stank of urban myth
And this consolidated us?

Dislocated, I feel dislocated from your world
Powering on in isolation
Dislocated, I feel dislocated from your world

That life was everything that she could take
She said don’t leave me alone, oh don’t leave me alone
I tried to save her from a big mistake
But the will to go on was leaving

Don’t leave me, don’t leave me
Baby don’t leave me alone
Don’t leave me, don’t leave me
Baby don’t leave me alone
We spend a sentence in a holding pen, in isolation
This ends by my hand

Descend online like ninja fiies on scentless defecation
Offending sights for soulless eyes of the mindless and vacant
Your neo God, your geo pod, it’s barely entertainment
The victims lie in shopping isles and you survive untainted

Dislocated, I feel dislocated from your world
Powering on in isolation
Dislocated, I feel dislocated from your world

That night, when she implied that she was afraid
She said don’t leave me alone, oh don’t leave me alone
By the time we suspected it was just too late for there to be anything left for us but grieving

Don’t leave me, don’t leave me
Baby don’t leave me alone
Don’t leave me, don’t leave me
Baby don’t leave me alone
We stand, the victims of supply and demand, in isolation

Woah-whoah wahoah
Turn it up and rock the house
Woah-whoah wahoah
Your gonna feel the thunder shake the ground

12865,Electric Worry,Clutch,"[Intro]
Well, you made me weep and you made me moan
When you caused me to leave, child, my happy home
But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life anymore

[Verse 1]
I get satisfaction everywhere I go
Where I lay my head, that's where I call home
Whether barren pines, or the mission stare
Take tomorrow's collar and give 'em back the glare

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos
Bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos

[Hook 1]
You told everybody in the neighborhood
What a dirty mistreater, that I was no good
But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life anymore

[Verse 2]
Doctor or lawyer, I'll never be
Life of a drifter, the only life for me
You can have your riches, all the gold you saved
Ain't room for one thing in everybody's grave

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos
Bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos

[Hook 2]
If I had money like Henry Ford
Lord, I'd have me a woman, yeah, on every road
But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life anymore

Invocation of the dummies, requiem for a head
Cash in at the corner, piles of street cred
I get satisfaction everywhere I go
One day, baby, you'll worry me no more

12880,White Lines,Tygers Of Pan Tang,"I spent all night on the highway
Can't believe how far I've come
Is there light at the end of this journey
Tell me when will I be done

There's something following behind you
Is it something in your head
I gotta find a way to ignore it
I'll find the answer up ahead

White lines, leading me on leading me on
White lines, down this never ending road
White lines, driving me wild driving me wild
White lines, it's a never ending road

Spent every weekend at a party
Can't believe the things I've done
No time for sleep when you're riding a white horse
Lost inside the rising sun

There goes that voice again behind you
Are you sure that way you hear
You gotta find a way to ignore it
Got to learn to crush your fears

Is something following behind you
Is it something in your head
You gotta find a way to ignore it
You'll find the answer up ahead

12853,Fortunate Son,The Dead Daisies,"[Verse 1]

Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays ""Hail to the chief""
Lord, they point the cannons at you

[Chorus]
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you off to war, now
And when we ask them, ""How much should I give?""
They just say
More! more! more! y'all

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no general's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, oh

Forødelse er målet nå, sleng det på bålet for
Alt ska bli te i aska, alt skal bli til jord og muld
La meg få tenna på, brenn heile Rogaland
Et svidd og øde landskap står tilbake gudsforlatt
Helvete ture fram – bråtebrann

Frå fylkesvei førtifira?

Incriminating text
Home for a shower

Evil dirty feeling
Headache and dry mouth

Driving around trying to clear my head
Turn the radio up, it’s our song again

I want it I know as it starts to begin

I know there's no turning back now

And takes over...

But I want it, I want it
I want it I know as I watch you give in
I've waited, I've waited, to feel this good

Hide the truth and watch you fall apart
It's the lie that eats away your soul my friend
As it rots away and plagues your mind
The remains of who you are gets left behind

Now your mark remains forever like all our sin

Seek and find
Cross the line
Sins combined
Only a matter of time

I can't believe I still put up with it
Are you think I'm full of it
Maybe you're right 'cause I'm fed up with it
But I need to see the sun rise
Everyday another compromise
You need to carry your cross
Your hammer, your nails, this ship's about to sail

You think I'm crazy
But I'm not the one who's lost his mind

The hurricane you're after leads to a big disaster
Your clouds are full of rain again and again and again and again
Your life is moving faster and time is still your master
No pleasure without pain, we do it again and again and again

Let's make the most of it
One stray bullet, it could destroy it
And then I'd be over it
No if's or but's, don't feed me no bullshit
I need to see the sun risе

The consequences of the way I lead my life
Leaves a feeling that is tricky to describe
It's like I'm living heaven and hell combined
The inner chaos and inner sanctum collide
And it feeds the bad circle of life
But it also makes me feel alive

Feeding my tormented soul
With all of your screaming
It makes me feel whole
Deadly, as far as I thrive
With all of my demons
I'm here to survive

Their narcissistic trash

Feeling like it's time to fly
Through this chaos to the other side

Round and round we go
"
12878,Home,Junkyard Drive,"[Chorus]
Tryna come back to what I know
If I ain't repress it too long
Send packets to whence I came
In this dump, just know to ping back home
Different paths to memories
Ain't seen this house for centuries
I live with colliding energies
Try to keep it submerged, keep it submerged

[Verse 1]
SD cards of young niggas wiped clean, roam free
Among the exports, familiar but it's beyond me
Throbbers surround, it's advised to keep it lowkey
If you see a brother, act like he isn't your homie
I seen sparks flying—to whom? Couldn't say more, son
Roamin' this junkyard, I'm one with the toxins
Circle never consisted of any humane persons
But catastrophic failure with bloomin' flower and no Sun
Idols mythical in the modern days
One thing 'bout my kind, we kinda used to being runaways
Paint the floor with us, redecoratin' for the holidays
Part of a bad batch, separated into commonplace
You're lucky if you see the Sun today
Homogenous mixes, so delicious when you counteract
Power override, left eye, effective cataract
Power override, left eye, effective cataract

[Chorus]
Tryna come back to what I know
If I ain't repress it too long
Send packets to whence I came
In this dump, just know to ping back home (Ah)
Different paths to memories
Ain't seen this house for centuries
I live with colliding energies
Try to keep it submerged, keep it submerged

[Verse 2]
Older niggas don't really require handouts
Formatted or unformatted, I figure that's how
Draw a line from my people to others, they be otherin'
Categorize me as subhuman, a Hollowman
All I know is the drive name that they gave me
Kero's a name I haven't heard for feels like ages
SD-001 at your service
For as long as ability maintains me at surface
Give in to temptation to turn over the wheel
You know you wanna, man, know you lovin' the thrill
'Nother kill, kill, kill, these your brethren still?
Just keep it real, real, real as guts that spilt
Welcome to your new life (Watch me take control), visor update, new sight (Watch-Watch me take control)
So much for the stuff that you said that you would do right (Watch me take control, watch-watch me take con-watch me take—)
Could never convince them to get you back at this rate (Watch me take control, watch me take con-watch me-watch me)
And you'll sound crazy if you explain, so good try (Wat-Wat-Wat-trol)

[Chorus]
If I ain't repress it too long
Send packets to whence I came
In this dump, just know to ping back home (Ah)
Different paths to memories
Ain't seen this house for centuries
I live with colliding energies
Try to keep it submerged, keep it submerged (We'll GoVyral in no time)

[Post-Chorus]
Idols mythical in the modern days
One thing 'bout my kind, we kinda used to being runaways
Paint the floor with us, redecoratin' for the holidays
Part of a bad batch, separated into commonplace
You're lucky if you see the Sun today
Homogenous mixes, so delicious when you counteract
Power override, left eye, effective cataract
Power override, left eye, effective cataract

[Outro]
(Idols mythical in the modern days)

Watch me t—

Let me tell you I've got hell to pay
I said this day would come
You laughed and looked the other way (way)

I don't mean to alarm you but the winds have finally changed
They're blowing my direction and it's changing the game
You said I couldn't do it, it's the reason that I stayed
Lit a fire in my heart and put ice in my veins

This time I'm leaving you behind
Don't care about tomorrow
I'm here to have a hell of a time!

Are you ready? Say Yea!
I ain't gonna lose
All the times you said I couldn't
Jokes on you!

Well I've love, lost, learned
Let me tell you I have paid my dues
And the crying child inside you
Believe me, I've been paying his too
Yea!

This time I'm leaving you behind
Don't care about tomorrow
I'm here to hell of a time!

Are you ready? Say Yea!
I ain't gonna lose
All the times you said I couldn't

And if you hear me say Yea!
Whatever I choose
Cause I'm proud of what I'm made of
I stay true!

I'm not going back
On my way
Wrong turn, take me back
Here to stay
I'm not going back
On my way

Talk to me, talk to me

Look at your hands as you're gripping those pills
You dance with the stigma then wake up in chills
You're not alone, not alone
You smile like no one can see through your mask
Too many doctors prescribing you crash
But you're not alone, not alone

12858,Die Rockin,Whiskey Myers,"[Verse 1]
I was born a wild child with the fear of the Holy Ghost
Raised on a field holler with the spirit in my bones
I turned 15, I was lost to the Pentecost
I felt a woman's breast and heard ""Sway"" by the Stones
Next thing you know, Lord, I’m in a band
We come from East Texas, that river bottom land
Harder than a Bois d'Arc tree, too drunk to stand
With cowboy hats and old guitars and Copenhagen cans

[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock until I die, I’m gonna die rockin'
I'm gonna rock until I die, I'm gonna die rockin'
I'm gonna rock until I die, I'm gonna die rockin'
Gonna die rockin’, gonna die rockin’
Woo, ooh-hoo
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh-hoo
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Gather 'round, you children, come on, take my hand
I’m gonna take you to a place and it ain't the Promised Land
It's got every thing you want, baby, but nothing's for sale
It’s a lost highway, it's a California hotel
It's where the ones who came before, they paid it with their lives
They gave their souls to rock and roll, I'm gonna rock until I die

[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock until I die, I'm gonna die rockin'
I'm gonna rock until I die, I'm gonna die rockin'
I'm gonna rock until I die, I'm gonna die rockin'

12860,School of Hard Knocks,Biff Byford,"I was brought up on the streets, British working class
My mother played piano, it echoes from the past
My father was a drinking man working all his life
Keeping us together through the trouble and the strife

I was brought up in the back streets
At the school of hard knocks
Trying to find my own feet
At the school of hard knocks
School of hard knocks

My brother had a friend, he taught me some guitar
I didn't have a clue I just felt it in my heart
I was playing, praying, trying to break away
Looking for my future down the Rock 'n' Roll highway

I was running on the back streets
At the school of hard knocks
Rocking to my own beat
At the school of hard knocks
School of hard knocks

I was trying to find my own feet
Rocking to m the back streets
Running from the back streets
At the school of hard knocks
School of hard knocks

Playing in a band, it's harder than you think
Trying to keep away from the drug abuse and drink
I lost a lot of friends but I had to make a choice
To find another path and hear my inner
Voice

I was rocking on the back streets
At the school of hard knocks
Trying to find my own feet
At the school of hard knocks

I was rocking on the back streets
Trying to find my own feet
Brought up in the back streets
At the school of hard knocks

12862,Detroit City 2020,Alice Cooper,"Me and Iggy were giggin' with Ziggy and kickin' with the MC5
Ted and Seger were burnin' with the fever, and Suzi Q was sharp as a knife
The kid was in his crib, and Shady wore a bib, and the Posse wasn't even alive
Shock rock, choppin' block, songs to make your heart stop, shove it into overdrive

Play it loud and fast
Make that guitar blast
Play it like today will be your last

Bleak town, sleak town, freak town
Detroit city
Downtown, Motown, my town
Detroit city

There was a riot ragin' downtown, try-in' to burn the place down, the skies were glowin' red and gray
But the grass keeps growin' and the money keeps flowin', and the streets are still smokin' today

Play it loud and fast
Cause the blues are in the past
Play it like today might be your last

Bleak town, sleak town, freak town
Detroit city
Downtown, Motown, my town
Detroit city

Bleak town, sleak town, freak town
Detroit city
Downtown, Motown, my town
Detroit city

Shake it down
Break it down
All around
Hallowed ground
Lost and found
Homeward bound
The Detroit sound
Is coming 'round

Lion town
Roarin' down
Tiger town
On the mound
Hockey town
Shoot the puck
Take 'em down
Don't give a what?

12889,Dying Light,Alter Bridge,"[Verse 1]
Here we go again, it's coming on just like before
The same old sinking feeling pulls me down an endless hole
Oh, the heavy lifting as I fret for what might be
If this is the beginning of the end then let me dream

[Pre-Chorus]
In the eye of the storm
From the moment we're born

[Chorus]
In the dying light
We learn to live when we give in
To the silent waves that crash inside
In the dying light
We can begin to live again
When we wake up to eternal life

[Verse 2]
Let this be an exercise in how to face your fears
Step into the realm of madness if you dare, my dear

[Pre-Chorus]
We are lost in the swarm
From the moment we're born

In the dying light
We learn to live when we give in
To the silent waves that crash inside
In the dying light
We can begin to live again
When we wake up to eternal life

All that we need passes by
Until we concede and resign
This mortal coil into the light

Here we go again, it's coming on just like before
The same old sinking feeling pulls me down an endless hole

In the dying light
We learn to live when we give in

12888,Can't Stop Rock & Roll,The New Roses,"Drivin' a clunker, livin' in a one room shack
Your back against the wall in debt up to your neck

You work hard at the hardware store
But you still know for sure that you‘re made for more
Someday your name will be cleared of shame
The difference is fame between the sinner and the saint

I won't give up
No I won't stop

Roll up your sleeves, you got nothin' to lose
It's a long way, it's a long way
But you all, you're gonna scream my name someday
Yes I know, I got what it takes to go a long way

Traded my old life for a pocket full of songs
I throw my racked guitar in the back of my car
Drive on till the mornin' comes

Ride across the nation
To be a part of this big Rock and Roll sensation

It's a long way, it's a long way
Rome wasn't built on a single day
Roll up your sleeves, you got nothin' to lose
It's a long way, it's a long way

[Verse 2]
No more nightmares, I've seen them all
From the day I was born, they've haunted my every move
Every open hand's there to push and shove
No time for love, it doesn't matter
She made a difference, I guess she had a way
Of making every night seem bright as day
Now I walk in shadows, never see the light
She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye

[Chorus 2]
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I need to forget her face, I see it still
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
No chance for contact
There's no raison d'etre
My only hope is one day I'll forget
The pain of knowing what can never be
With or without love, it's all the same to me

[Chorus 3]
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel, feel
Pain that you feel, feel

12931,Close My Eyes Forever,Lita Ford,"[Verse 1: Lita Ford & Ozzy Osbourne]
Baby, I get so scared inside
And I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind
Or is it fantasy?
Heaven is in the palm of my hand
And it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do
With a childhood tragedy?

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

[Verse 2: Ozzy Osbourne & Lita Ford]
Sometimes, it's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems
When you're face to face with me
Like a dagger, you stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep would you shelter me
In your warm and darkened grave?

[Chorus: Lita Ford]
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

[Post-Chorus: Lita Ford & Ozzy Osbourne]

No, I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me?
No, I'll never feel the same

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

I should have known better than to let you go alone
It's times like these, can't make it on my own
Wasted days and sleepless nights
And I can't wait to see you again

I find I spend my time waiting on your call
How can I tell you, babe? My back's against the wall
I need you by my side to tell me it's alright
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore

When he looks at the pictures up on the shelf
He just smiles to himself

You're almost out of time (Just a warning)
Your fate is left to a different generation
You know they won't be kind
You take this hate and package it to sell
(To victims of your great divide)
You've no capacity to even feel
(I hope you get this through your mind)

[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies
Will tear you apart
Will take you alive
Won't spare you at all

[Chorus]
I'll tell you all your lies
Will tear you apart
I'm calling all to one
So everyone and all
It's time to hear your voice

[Bridge]
Because now I won't let you
Just break me in two
There's no way that I would give in
Those words that you say
Of hate and dismay
Will lose you your place in the end

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Your lies
Will tear you apart
I'll tell you all your lies
Will tear you apart
I'm calling all to one
So everyone and all
It's time to hear your voice
You've got the right

12946,Edge Of A Broken Heart,Vixen,"[Verse 1]
I can't believe I could have been so blind, but love is strange
I thought about it for a long long time, but the truth remains
I don't need another lonely night to dry my tears
The answer's plain as black an' white and I can see the picture very clear

[Chorus]
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye

[Verse 2]
It isn't like you never had the chance to change your tune
Did you think that I'm a dime a dance, well the dance is through

I've been doing things for way too long
But baby that's over (baby that's over)
It won't be easy but I gotta be strong
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder

I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye

Who's nothing like you
Two can play the game as well
And your gonna be sorry baby when it's over

I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl

I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye

12919,Good Morning Midnight,Backyard Babies,"[Verse 1]
Shadows, angels, cramps, heathens and blood
Or is it the fluid that I feel a cold sweating flood?
The hours of the day and night and weeks
Are mashing up into a nightmare where pixies streak

[Verse 2]
Is this for real or an imaginary world?
I gotta keep my head up straight above the swirl
Gotta stay in focus, don't close your eyes
Gotta scribble my emotions with truth and lies

[Chorus]
I'm getting out of my own way
Can't stand to be alone
Kick the demon, take the fight
Good morning midnight, well, alright

[Verse 3]
It's hard to even localize the rain
But my tears are pouring down like driving rain
The dream is real but the ghosts are out of sight
At the end down this tunnel, I see light

[Chorus]
I'm getting out of my own way
Can't stand to be alone
Kick the demon, take the fight
Good morning midnight, well, alright

[Bridge]
Doctor, doctor, there's a black cloud under my bed
Get rid of all my mind creeps in my head

[Chorus]
I'm getting out of my own way
Can't stand to be alone
Kick the demon, take the fight
Good morning midnight, well, alright
I'm getting out of my own way
Can't stand to be alone
Kick the demon, take the fight
Good morning midnight, well, alright

The blood is painting the streets again
With hammers and razor blades
Thieves and riots are our daily bread

Stylishly and fearlessly, we control what is wrong and right
So be kind
If you come for us, we'll cut you a smile

May I be at the heaven's gate
A half hour before
Before the devil knows I'm dead
I'm always dressed up for good

So be kind
If you come for us, we'll cut you a smile

12943,Wild Frontier,Gary Moore,"I remember the old country
They call the emerald land
And I remember my home town
Before the wars began

Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear them sing again
The Forty Shades Of Green

We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're goin' back
Back to the wild frontier

I remember my city streets
Before the soldiers came
Now armoured cars and barricades
Remind us of our shame

We are drowning in a sea of blood
The victims you have seen
Never more to sing again
The Forty Shades Of Green

We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling

Those are the days I will remember
Those are the days I most recall
We count the cost of those we lost
And pray it's not in vain
The bitter tears of all those years
I hope we live to see those days again

Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear us sing again
The Forty Shades Of Green

And I remember a friend of mine
So sad now that he's gone
They tell me I'll forget
As time goes on

We're goin' back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're goin' back
Back to the wild frontier (can you hear it callin'?)
Back to the wild frontier (can you hear it callin', callin?)
Back to the wild frontier

Those forty shades of green are calling me back home

Ooh, we're goin' back
Back to the wild frontier
I'm goin' back
Back to the wild frontier

12911,Can't Sleep,Blacktop Mojo,"[Verse 1]
You've been out there in the city
What did you bring back for me?
A vicious preoccupation
With a darkness underneath
And there's something empty now
In the way that you live
Is there something you're hiding?
Oh darling, I'm afraid to ask

[Chorus]
Lie awaken 'cause you're worried in the dead of the night
Why are you staring at the ceiling till the morning light?
Is your heart pounding with a secret that you can't keep?
Tell me why you can't sleep

[Verse 2]
I've been sitting here waiting
Stare out the window on the street
Watch strangers come round the corner
Hoping it was you I'd see
I pretend not to notice
The distance in your eyes
But when you pull me in closer
Smell cigarette smoke and lies

[Chorus]
Lie awaken 'cause you're worried in the dead of the night
Why are you staring at the ceiling till the morning light?
Is your heart pounding with a secret that you can't keep?
Tell me why you can't sleep

[Bridge]
You're not the only one who ever needed
Speak, scream it aloud and showdown your demons
Lies make you weak and that's why you can't sleep

[Chorus]
Lie awaken 'cause you're worried in the dead of the night
Why are you staring at the ceiling till the morning light?
Is your heart pounding with a secret that you can't keep?
Tell me why you can't sleep

Tell me why you can't sleep
Tell me why you can't sleep
Tell me why you can't sleep

12907,Burning Star,D-A-D,"[Verse 1]
No one gave you the tools to make a real life
And they delivered most of the parts, but you couldn't get it right
And if your mind is blind to the walls you made in the past
And if the boredom of trivial roads has led to a crash

[Chorus]
Somewhere up above the clouds, among a million prayers
Flies a little hope of mine, if someone out there cares
But back on Earth, I see it here, it shines its endless light
And all I got is empty space, a burning star, a burning star of light

[Verse 2]
And there are dreams on Earth, you need three lives to fulfill
And there are lives you live ’til the end by standing still
And we've got too many lives at either end of the night
And we've got plenty of lives cut short by what we carry inside

[Chorus]
Somewhere up above the clouds, among a million prayers
Flies a little hope of mine, if someone out there cares
But back on Earth, I see it here, it shines its endless light
And all I got is empty space, a burning star, a burning star
A burning star of light

[Alternative Chorus]
Tell me something I don’t know, and maybe I've lived too long
I've got a bad case of I-told-you-so, and it's hard to hold my tongue
But back on Earth, I see it here, it shines its endless light
And all I got is empty space, a burning star, a burning star
A burning star, a burning star of light

And the thrill of success is the purest

Shoot to kill

On the road down to Tennessee
Ain't got a place, got a place for me
Grew up dreaming of Virginia Reel
Now we dance to the sound of their stainless steel

But the first step is always the hardest, and the second one is always the first, and the thrill of success is the purest, but the eyes that behold you are cursed

And you can’t quite make it, but you´re not about to fake it, don't you know you're left on your one

Shoot to kill

But the first step is always the hardest, and the second one is always the first, and the thrill of success is the purest, but the eyes that behold you are cursed

And you can’t quite make it, but you´re not about to fake it, don't you know

12988,Paranoia,Hostile Array,"Fan the flame, there's no silver lining to this cloud, it's like every bitter pill you're fed leaves you foaming at the mouth

You drown out every voice that's not your own, because everything you hear makes your blood run cold

Paranoid people in the places you pray
Paranoid in the worst kind of way
Paranoid people by the light of a screen
Turn a blind eye and stay on the edge of your seat

Your brother, the other side to a story you don't know
Clutch your pearls, hold on tight, feed the hate that grows and grows
Condemn them, in spite of your faith. Condemn me, in spite of the blood that runs through our veins

Paranoid people in the places you pray
Paranoid in the worst kind of way
Paranoid people by the light of a screen
Turn a blind eye and stay on the edge of your seat

You hang on every word that makes your stomach churn, but there's no way to build a bridge when you'd rather watch it burn

Fan the flame, set me ablaze, fuel the fire with every word you say
Fan the flame, set me ablaze, I'm sick of choking on your every phrase

Hollow and sunken eyes
You never hear the locusts

Wars wage another day
But you forsake the reason
Right now no one is safe
While there's still life to feast on

If you were the abused
Would you feel the same way too?

If it happened to you

Would you be the same way too?

Wash out anothеr life
While you savor the taking

Then see all the attrition

You turn your head to forget

Would you be the same way too?

You
You turn your head to forget
You look the other way
You push away your regret
For another day
Cause you're in over your head
You know you can't be saved
No, you can't be saved

If it happened to you
It could happen to you
If you were the abused
Would you feel the same way too?

If it happened to you
It could happen to you
If you were in their shoes
Would you be the same way too?

12962,House of Pain,Faster Pussycat,"It's a little past suppertime
I'm still out on the porch step sittin' on my behind
Waitin' for you
Wonderin' if everything was all right
Momma said, ""Come in, boy, don't waste your time""
I said, ""I've got time, well, he'll be here soon""

Five years old and talkin' to myself
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy, can't you tell?

I'm not trying to fake it and I ain't the one to blame
No, there's no one home in my house of pain
And I didn't write these pages and my script's been rearranged
No, there's no one home in my house of pain
No, there's no one home in my house of pain

Wasn't I worth the time?
A boy needs a daddy like a dance to mime
And all the time, I looked up to you
I paced my room a million times
And all I ever got was one big line, the same old lie
How could you?

Well, I was eighteen and still talkin' to myself
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy, can't you tell?

I'm not tryin' to fake it and I ain't the one to blame
No, there's no one home in my house of pain
And I didn't write these pages and my script's been rearranged
No, there's no one home in my house of pain
No, there's no one home in my house of pain

I'm not tryin' to fake it and I ain't the one to blame
No, there's no one home in my house of pain

No, there's no one home

No, there's no one home

No, there's no one home
(No, there's no one home)
In my house of pain
No, there's no one home

I'm alone again

Well, if I learned anything from this
It's how to live on my own

12968,Pathetic,My Own Words,"[verse 1]
Hard sun, it's getting hot today
Rough heat, my tongue's too dry to say
The pain that digs into my head
The pain that digs into my head
My friends are taking a distance
I'm still a kid but they are men
I talk too much into my songs
I talk too much about my own obsessions

[Chorus]
Whatever how hard I try, I stay the same
I have to learn how to live with that fucking brain
I'm not gentle, I'm not pretty, I'm not clever
I'm not a boy, but I'm not a girl neither
I know, this is
So pathetic

[verse 2]
Hard sun, think I'm gonna stay home
Big deal, because I'm all alone
Summer, sounds like it's gonna be
Bitter, without someone to see
In me, I've got like a machine
That speaks, sometimes instead of me
I know, I look like a monster
I know, I look like a demon
Or a moron

Whatever how hard I try, I stay the same
I have to learn how to live with that fucking brain
I'm not gentle, I'm not pretty, I'm not clever

Sorry for my crude words
For acting like a turd
Sorry if I'm laughing loud
If I fly away like a cloud
Jerk off 'bout your booty
Yeahn I know, I'm sorry
I can't be understood
I'm always in a bad mood
'cause I'm pathetic
Yeah, that's pathetic
Well, that's pathetic 'cause...

I know that I'm

I'm cold as ice
I paid the price, I don't care
There's more of me, there's more of you
We're everywhere
I gotta be the one to kill this flame
I will go insane living life in the wrong lane
I'm cold as ice
I paid the price, I don't care
There's more of me, there's more of you
Nothing to lose
Cold as ice

[Verse 1: Kyle Pfeiffer, Kyle Pfeiffer & Roman James]
There's a little pain in my heart
For the way that we start to criticize the art
Though we shoot for the stars
So much more to see
So much more to believe
So much more than the simple mind
You want me to be
It's like I chase the sun
Here I come, here I come
Better stay far away or I might come undone
So much more to see
So much more to believe
So much more than the simple mind you want me to be

It's like I'm under attack
I react and I snap
I will protect the knife
You know the one in my back
So much more to bleed
It's like bitter defeat
It can feel like the world is nothin' more than disease
I got a lot to lose, I got a lot to gain
I got the feeling in my head that I'm about to reign
So much more to bleed
It's like bitter defeat
It can feel like the world is nothing more than disease

I'm cold as ice
I paid the price, I don't care
There's more of me, there's more of you
We're everywhere
I gotta be the one to kill this flame

I paid the price, I don't care
There's more of me, there's more of you
Nothing to lose
Cold as ice

So much to take, so much to gain
No other way
The only drive that keeps our sanity
So much to take, so much to gain
No other way
The only drive that keeps our sanity
So much to take, so much to gain
No other way
The only drive that keeps our sanity!

Why'd you call me on the phone?
Your mama can't solve your problems
When's daddy ever get home?
So you did your little move and cried
In the middle of a suicide

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby

There's no one there to hold you
No one hears your scream
You live life up and down
Your nightmare's are your dreams
I know it's lonely when you're hanging 'round
Don't you take it lying down, no, no

Hold on, hold on tight
I'll make everything all right
Wake up, don't go to sleep
I pray the Lord your soul to keep

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby

I get kicked in the face, still I come back for more

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces, start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl, I can't take any more

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you've ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad

I gave it everything, but you threw it all away

And it's hard to believe you still treat me this way

12950,Fallen Angel,Poison,"[Verse 1]
She stepped off the bus
Out into the city streets
Just a small town girl with her whole life packed
In a suitcase by her feet
But somehow the lights didn't shine as bright
As they did on her mama's TV screen
And the work seemed harder, days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be

But you know, you gotta stick to your guns
When it all comes down
'Cause sometimes you can't choose
It's like heads they win, tails you're gonna lose

Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

[Verse 2]
Now she found herself in the fast lane
Livin' day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And watched her family slip away
And just like a lost soul caught up in the Hollywood scene
All the parties and the limousines
Such a good actress hiding all her pain
Trading her memories for fortune and fame

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a step away
From the edge of a fall
Caught between Heaven and Hell
Where's the girl I knew a year ago?

[Chorus]
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

Too much, too soon
Or just a little too late
'Cause when her ship came in
She wasn't there, it just wouldn't wait

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies

You're going crazy too
The walls around you
Closing in
You need a change

Claustrophobic
Feeling scared
You need somebody
But no one seems to care
A one way ticket
A change of pace
You've had enough
Can't take no more

Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains

Got this letter
Came today
From my baby
Who left me yesterday
Said she loves me
She'll come back
She wants to try

I won't let her
She'll be upset
I know it's better
Than something I'll regret
She's been dishonest
And insincere
I lost my mind
Twenty times a year

Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains

I look around
But, baby, you were gone
But I don't mind
And I don't worry
I will survive

I'm alone
Now that you're gone
Don't need nobody
To hold or tie me down
I broke the chains
So let me be
I've gotta be free

Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains
Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me

Shadowboxing, when I heard you on the radio
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new toy
I'm going insane
Starting a hurricane releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain or maintain
Unless you say my name (A'ight)
Rippin', killin', diggin' and drillin' a hole
Past your soul

12964,Uncle Tom's Cabin,Warrant,"Just for the record, let's get the story straight
Me and Uncle Tom were fishin', it was gettin' pretty late
Out on a cypress limb above the wishin' well
Where they say it got no bottom, say it take you down to hell

Over in the bushes and off to the right
Come two men talkin' in the pale moonlight
Sheriff John Brady and Deputy Hedge
Haulin' two limp bodies down to the water's edge

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, oh, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell

They didn't see me and Tom in the tree
Neither one believin' what the other could see
Tossed in the bodies, let 'em sink on down
To the bottom of the well where they'd never be found

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, oh, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies in the wishin' well

[Guitar Solo]

Soon as they were gone, me and Tom got down
Prayin' real hard that we wouldn't make a sound
Runnin' through the woods back to Uncle Tom's shack
Where the full moon shines through the rooftop cracks

Oh my God, Tom, who are we gonna tell?
The Sheriff, he belongs in a prison cell
Keep your mouth shut, that's what we're gonna do
Unless you wanna wind up in the wishing well too

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, ooh, yeah, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell
Oh, I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies, know who put the bodies
In the wishin' well, oh, yeah

Everything is fucked, everybody sucks
You don't really know why, but you wanna justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact, and if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days

It's just one of those days, feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain leaves with a blood stain
Damn right, I'm a maniac, you better watch your back
'Cause I'm fuckin' up your program!
And if you're stuck up, you're just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!

I feel like shit
My suggestion is to keep your distance
'Cause right now I'm dangerous
We've all felt like shit and been treated like shit
All those motherfuckers that want to step up
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break your fuckin' face tonight!
Give me somethin' to break
Give me somethin' to break
Just give me somethin' to break
How 'bout your fuckin' face?
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw (What?)
A chainsaw (What?)
A motherfuckin' chainsaw (What?)

Alright, yeah

I met this girl around quarter to ten
We made it once, she said, ""Make me again""
She wrapped her love around me all night long
In the mornin' we were still goin' strong
Now let me tell ya', it sure feels good
First time I saw that girl, I knew it would
Now let me tell ya', it sure felt right
No pullin' teeth, she didn't wanna fight

She said, ""Shake me""
Shake it, don't break it, baby
Shake me
All night she said
All night long

Screamed and scratched and rolled out of the bed
I never really got her out of my head
And now and then she makes those social calls
Gives me a squeeze, gets me kickin' the walls
Now let me tell ya', it still feels tight
And we were shakin' after every bite
I feel her comin' in the middle of the night
Screamin' higher

[Chorus]
Shake me
All night
She said, ""Shake me""
Shake it, don't break it, baby
Shake me
All night she said, ""Shake me""
Ooh, yeah
All night, keep the fire burnin' cause we're doin' alright
All night, come on and shake it right

I guess for me there's just no hope
I never meant to be so cold

Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath
It's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover
I don't want to change the world
I just want to leave it colder
Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere

Or how I'm just another fucking sheep in the herd?

Selling my soul and changing my name?
Did you hear the one about me being a prick?

I could dive right in and find what’s missing

If we could take a glance inside
We can stir the tides of Liberation
Set us free, free, free

Ahhhh

Dig me out
I’m trapped inside this reality
With all this bloodshed and suffering
That’s all dealt by our own hands
Our living nightmare
This
World is run by the violence
Of sins committed in silence
Death, destruction and distain
Between good and evil

World run by power
World run by money
Religious business
For the superstitious
World run by fear
World run by chaos
No one to hear
No one to save us
World run by war
World run by killing
No one survives
Everyone dies

We think we’re justified
To kill innocent souls
That choose to not abide
To our damn fiendish rules
We’ve all been separated
Through our absurdity

By all our prejudice
Ideals, uncertainty

This world was once together
Now it is falling apart
Destined to all end this way
All planned right from the start
The truths are hidden from us
We’re victims of deceit

We’re told that we’ll be saved
That this is not the end
Just as we lay here and bleed
No justice to comprehend

We all deserve paradise
But always made to suffer
Living meaningless lives
When we are something greater
Slaving away for others
Just to make them all richer
Our days are numbered to live
What else do we have to give?

This is our revolution

We have to make a change
We have to come together
We have to take control
And make this world much better

Yeah

This is our revolution

Blegh

This is our revolution

This world was once together
Now has fallen apart
Destined to all end this way
All planned right from the start
We have to make a change
We have to come together
We have to take control
And make this world much better

Looks like my summer vacation is over
Warmer than the light hoping to be pardoned
Daybreak is coming to harvest an empty garden
Cut you loose from all you know
But every step forward is closer to home

[Bridge: Tyler Small]
One of my eyes can only see the past
My line of sight broken, I can only look back

[Chorus: Tyler Small]
My teeth are crumbling in my mouth
My ashes spread around
Still fighting the devil in my hometown
Forever was so far from here
But now there's more past than future
It hurts to hear but you know that it's true
You think you're killing time
But time is slowly killing you

[Outro: Tyler Small & Chase Papariello]
Monsters in my closet keeping me up at night

13010,Love Hate Relationship,Trapt,"[Verse 1]
I keep swinging with those moods
I keep crawling back to you
I know now that love is blind
Because you put that veil over my eyes
I'm addicted to your touch
You tear me down to build me up
I'm a sucker for this game
But it's all I want to play

[Pre-Chorus]
A little piece of heaven raising hell
Sex is just a weapon that you use to possess
Keep me all to yourself

[Chorus]
The more I feel the pleasure
The more I feel the pain
I'm in a love hate relationship too deep to escape
Everyday is a gamble
That's the risk that I take
In a love hate relationship and you are to blame

[Verse 2]
I keep taking this abuse
Oh am I being used
Thought you were the perfect drug
Well this time I think I took too much
You taste so bitter sweet
You mean so much to me
Be careful with a heart you take
Because it's a heart that you can break

[Pre-Chorus]
A little piece of heaven raising hell
Sex is just a weapon that you use to possess
Keep me all to yourself

[Chorus]
The more I feel the pleasure
The more I feel the pain
I'm in a love hate relationship too deep to escape
Everyday is a gamble
That's the risk that I take
In a love hate relationship and you are to blame

[Bridge]
We pull it together
And tear it apart
We walk a thin line
It's just who we are

[Pre-Chorus]
A little piece of heaven raising hell
Sex is just a weapon that I have to accept
You got me all to yourself

[Chorus]
The more I feel the pleasure
The more I feel the pain
I'm in a love hate relationship too deep to escape
Everyday is a gamble
That's the risk that I take
In a love hate relationship and you are to blame

[Outro]
And the higher you take me
The farther I fall
In a love hate relationship and you I have lost
I have to forgive you
For all of your flaws
In a love hate relationship and you're all I want

13025,Dance With The Devil,Breaking Benjamin,"[Intro]
Here I stand
Helpless and left for dead

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes
So many days go by
Easy to find what's wrong
Harder to find what's right

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe in you
I can show you that
I can see right through
All your empty lies
I won't stay long
In this world so wrong

Say goodbye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the Devil tonight

Crawling across my skin
Feeling your cold, dead eyes
Stealing the life of mine

All your empty lies
I won't last long

13042,The Deep End,Crossfade,"[Verse 1]
I built my life like my bike, on a rigid frame
Nothing bends, it only breaks into
Pieces and pieces
I waited for a hope to arrive, but it never came
Leaving me with only pain inside
I'm going off the deep end

[Verse 2]
I built my life on a rigid frame
So nothing bends, it only breaks into
Pieces and pieces
I waited for a hope to arrive, but it never came
Leaving me with only pain inside
I'm going off the deep end

[Chorus 1]
Holding on is harder than it seems
When you're reaching for so much more
Seems so much easier to just give in
When you're reaching for so much more

[Verse 3]
Another wasted Saturday, so here I stay
Where nothing seems to ever change, anyway, hey
All this hype about life being great
Where's the love for me these days?
I'm going off the deep end

Holding on is harder than it seems
When you're reaching for so much more
Seems so much easier to just give in
When you're reaching for so much more

Holding on is harder than it seems
When you're reaching for so much more
Seems so much easier to just give in
When you're reaching for so much more

I have nothing left to give
I have found the perfect end
You were made to make it hurt
Disappear into the dirt
Carry me to heaven's arms
Light the way and let me go
Take the time to take my breath
I will end where I began

I feel nothing anymore

Praying to whoever will listen to me
I'd fashioned my own cross, been crushed by its weight
There's no stronger message than dirt in your face

13018,I Feel Alive,Steady Rollin,"The trees, are singing in the wind
The sky blue, only as it can be
And the angels, smiled at me

I saw you, in that lonely bench
At half past four, I kissed your soft soft hands and at 6 I kissed your lips and the angels smiled, I thought

Hey I feel alive!

The park sign, said it was closed
And we jumped that fence with no cares at all and we kissed under a tree

We danced, under the midnight sun
And I loved you, without knowing you at all and we laughed and felt so free and the angels they smiled, I thought

Hey, I feel alive!

13046,Electric,Tyler Gilbert,"You speak in absolutes but your purpose here is unclear
You feel you're owed something I’ll see you in the dirt beside me
Leave me alone just the way I am
I am the cockroach, you can never kill thee

If all this is electric
Then what have you done
If all this is determined
Then why have you come
Underdog

I am the one your mother told you to be afraid of
I will not sympathize with all the problems you made up
You think you're something else I’ll be the one to let you know
I’ll be there standing tall wait for you to fall to let you go

And she said that she's ashamed
What have I become?
What have I done?
I spoke to the devil today
And he swears he's not to blame
And I understood
'Cause I feel the same

Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side
The righteous side of Hell

[Verse 2]
I heard from God today
And she sounded just like me
What have I done?
And who have I become?
I saw the devil today
And he looked a lot like me
I looked away
I turned away

Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven

And the righteous side
The righteous side of Hell

Downward descending
Falling further and further away
Getting closer every day
I'm getting closer every day
To the end
To the end, the end, the end
I'm getting closer every day

Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side
The righteous side of Hell

Can you feel it crush you? Does it seem to bring the worst in you out?
There's no runnin' away from these things that hold you down

Of all the colors that you've shined, this is surely not your best
But you should know these colors that you're shinin' are...

No time to hide

Gonna fill these trenches
And stand up, wake up, I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, stuck in a hole, damage control
Digging for rhymes on a secondhand cell phone
Will I survive? Will I survive another year?
Still month to month
Paying my dues on the inside
Breaking up my mind on the outside
Never again, never again will I be denied

I've been thrown down, run around
Beaten till I hit the ground

For all the things I've done
I've made a few mistakes
But I'm not the only one

I'd rather you hate me for everything I am
Than have you love me for something that I can't

So now I'll ask, ""Do you like that? Do you like that?"" (No!)

[Chorus]
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

[Verse 2]
Try to find out what makes you tick
As I lie down, sore and sick
Do you like that, do you like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate
And I don't mind, just let me say
That I like that, I like that

[Chorus]
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page, as I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

[Bridge]
Desperate, I will crawl
Waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone
What have I become?

[Chorus]
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page, as I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane

Take it, I don't need it (I don't need it)
I don't wanna hear your motherfuckin' side
You can love it (You can love it)
Or you can leave it (Or you can leave it)
Because nothing I say and nothing I feel is right
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't understand
While I'm sitting up here dying, you're just holding out your hand
And even if I wanted to, I couldn't have explained
'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no denying it, you've never had control

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out

[Verse 2]
I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave)
It doesn't matter how much money I get paid
I give a shit (I give a shit), I never did (I never did)
So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin
If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear?
Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear?
If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere?
'Cause in the end, I'll never bend, I'll never shed a tear

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no denying it, I've always had control

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out

How you've turned me inside out
Inside out

How you've turned me inside out

While I'm circlin' the drain

Say “Aye”

Get behind the piper
And do what he tells you
All those in favor
Say “Aye”

Then they terrorize it
Try to euthanize us
Take us down (I’m awake)
Realize it
Then they ostracize it
Try to euthanize us
Cut us down (I’m awake)

Euthanize
Running, becoming a vegetable

Realize it
Then they terrorize it
Try to euthanize us
Take us down (I’m awake)
Realize it
Then they ostracize it
Try to euthanize us
Cut us down (I’m awake)

13092,Black Water,Massface,"Lay down, close your eyes and I’ll take you away
To place with no tears and no sorrow
Where diamonds are scattered
All over the sky
They seem
So cold and hollow

Burning bridges, get ready
For things that you call ""life""
Smoke of fire fills
Emptiness inside

Your soul is deep in black water
All that you want is a light
It’s time to break through the surface
To the bright!

Whenever you're sinking
Do not fear the unknown
No matter if you're not strong
You still breathe
So keep trying
Just tear off the mask
And make it all your own
Follow the light
Go on

Drop by drop, you fill the lake
Which becomes the ocean
Spark in the night can be
Brighter than stars
Go, set fire your emotion

Whenever you're sinking
Do not fear the unknown
No matter if you're not strong
You still breathe..
So keep trying!
Just tear off the mask
And make it all your own
Follow the light
Go on

Breathe new life
Feel reborn

You're never alone
No matter what's happening
Take a piece of my heart
And make it your own
Go on

13094,The Killing,Zero Theorem,"If in fact we’re all just ordinary animals
Is our consciousness our own disease?
Did we mean to create adversaries?
Typical
The trap we set is our own belief

Bodies continue to fall
The killing’s taking over
There is no end to it all
Don’t sit back and wait ‘til the killing is over
There is no place to hide
‘til the killing is over
Commence with the killing

If in fact we’re just the start of something historical
Maybe we need to get to the nеxt scene
Let our cеlls divide themselves while we go for a ride
As we roll we laugh at our old things

Bodies continue to fall
The killing’s taking over
There is no end to it all
Don’t sit back and wait ‘til the killing is over
There is no place to hide
‘til the killing is over
Commence with the killing

No matter what you do
You are the problem too
Banging our heads ‘til they shrink
Circular Insanity

Bodies continue to fall
The killing’s taking over
There is no end to it all
Don’t sit back and wait ‘til the killing is over
There is no place to hide
‘til the killing is over
Commence with the killing

Dig our way down inside
With a fist on the ground and a finger to the sky
There is no place to hide
Commence with the killing

Dig our way down inside
With a fist on the ground and a finger to the sky
There’s no place to fucking hide
Commence with the killing

Oh, in misery
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Like fire on the first day
Higher than a jet plane
I never knew that it could feel this way
I was too far gone
I was too far in
And I didn’t see it coming
But our love was just too steep
And I
Before I knew it I was in too deep
I shoulda
Shoulda known
You were wrong
In the worst way

[Pre-Chorus]
In the worst way
In the worst way
I’m gonna walk away

You make me wanna scream
End it all and leave
Strike the match and burn our names
In flames
Gasoline
You'll forever be
In misery

Woah, woah, woah
Oh, in misery
Woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2]
Set fire to the airways
Every word that you say
Is never ever worth the time of day
You wrote a lot of lies
Trying to cash in
And I shoulda seen it coming
Our love was just too deep
And now
Your drowning in a sea of misery
I shoulda
Shoulda known you were wrong in the worst way

[Pre-Chorus]
In the worst way
In the worst way
I'm gonna make you pay

You make me wanna scream
End it all and leave

You make me want a scream
End it all and leave
Strike the match and burn our names

13099,Welcome Home,HELLYEAH,"[Verse 1]
Far off in the distance, the storm's closing in
The pressure collapsing, bright skies become dim
This scent all around me, give memories new life
Knots that I've loosened still tangled inside
Ominous clouds, no sun in the sky
Is this a metaphor for my tragic demise?
The colors are gray on my canvas of life
The picture's complete, but the paint just won't dry

[Chorus]
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home

[Verse 2]
And those dirty little whispers, demon's voice in my head
Angel over my shoulder, evil needs to be fed
Hot flashes turn cold as day turns to night
My head starts to ache because something's not right
Pour salt in my wounds, I'm cut deep inside
Battered and bruised, bones breaking, teeth bite
Tattered and torn, pour gas on my life
You can burn up the book, but the pages survive

[Chorus]
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home, so welcome home

[Post-Chorus]
So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome

[Bridge]
The sky is falling, the sky is falling down
The ocean's flooding, the oceans are swelling everywhere all around
The fire's burning, fire burns me to the ground
What the fuck was I waiting for?
All you fucking little pigs, I'll blow you down

[Chorus]
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home, so welcome home

[Post-Chorus]
So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome home

13052,All or Nothing,Theory of a Deadman,"When I first saw you standing there
You know, was a little hard not to stare
So nervous when I drove you home
I know, being apart’s a little hard to bare
Sent some flowers to your work
In hopes that I'd have you in my arms again
We kissed that night before I lapsed
Still now, was something I could never forget
You've got all that I need

Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
With you, I know that I am good for something
So, lets go, give it a try
We got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I

Let's take a chance, go far away today
And never look back again
Since I said I loved you in Las Vegas
It's never been the same since then
You've got all that I need

Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
With you, I know that I am good for something
So, lets go, give it a try
We got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I

This is it, nothing to hide
One more kiss, never say goodbye
This is it, babe, you're all mine

Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
I know that I am good for something
So, lets go, give it a try
We got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
With you, I know that I am good for something

Had swallowed you whole

You are the tainted cast-off

13087,A Grave Mistake,Ice Nine Kills,"[Verse 1]
Here lies the lifeless bride and groom
""Till death do us part"" came far too soon
Buildings burn and people die all of the time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I heard that you reap what you sow
So, around and around we go
And when you see my face, you'll know

[Chorus]
You can't save yourself
Or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With weathered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen flies the crow
You can't save yourself

[Verse 2]
These vengeful thoughts trapped underneath
Rage, scorn, misery
Payback for what you took from me:
Hope, love, sanity

[Pre-Chorus]
I've heard that you reap what you sow
So, here's to believing in ghosts
Now when you see my face, you'll know

[Chorus]
You can't save yourself
Or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With weathered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen flies the crow

[Bridge]
No forgiveness, just farewell
From the match made in heaven
You sent straight to hell
No forgiveness, no escape
May you rest in pieces
For your grave mistake
For your grave mistake

[Chorus]
You can't save yourself
Or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With weathered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen flies the crow
You can't save yourself

[Outro]
No, you can't save yourself
For your grave mistake
You can't save yourself
"
13084,No More,Disturbed,"[Verse 1]
Once again we hear them calling for war
It doesn't matter what they're fighting for
They light the match and watch the whole world burst into flame
The story's always the same
So tell me, people, are you ready to kill?
Behold the propaganda, get your fill
A distant enemy is threatening our freedom again
How much would you like to spend?

[Pre-Chorus]
Millions are falling in line
And it's just a matter of time
Endless destruction will ensure their pockets are lined
For all time

[Chorus]
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Verse 2]
They don't care about the blood on their hands
Look at the world, and you will understand
They count the money as the innocent continue to bleed
They're always planting the seed
So tell me, people, are you ready to die
Without believing in the reason why?
They paint a picture, and the whole damn world is deceived
It's all that they ever need

[Pre-Chorus]
Millions keep falling in line
It's only a matter of time
Sowing destruction will make sure their pockets are lined
For all time

[Chorus]
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore

[Bridge]
No, it can't be disguised anymore
How they smile as we pay for their war

[Chorus]
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more defending the lies
Behind the never-ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more

13081,wonderful life,Bring Me The Horizon,"[Intro: Oli Sykes]
Hey, uh, are we rolling?
Yeah, okay; no it’s, that’s fine
I read a fun fact about the brain and
How it starts to deteriorate when
We get to 27 or thereabouts (Yeah)
It got me thinking about my head
And what I can do to help stimulate it
Makes me sad, but I've forgotten what I’m on about
(Ah!)

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
Looked on the bright side, got keratitis
And you can't sit there unless you’re righteous
I wear a happy face like I’m Ed Gein
I feel all numb now, is that a feeling?
Like a plastic boxed orange with no peel on
I wanna waste, I wanna waste, I wanna waste away
(Yeah!)

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
'Lone, getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life

[Verse 2: Oli Sykes]
Oi, Debbie Downer, what's your problem?
Don't wanna be here, still, call shotgun
You got the FOMO coursing through my veins (Yo, yay, yo, yay)
(This is) Not a drill, no, this is the real world
Domesticated, still, a little feral
Well, don't you know to chew with your mouth closed?
(And it's all gone wrong!)

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
'Lone, getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife (Yeah!)
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
(Oh, what a wonderful life)
(Oh, what a wonderful life)
Alright

[Bridge: Dani Filth & Oli Sykes]
I got a type 2 kinda thirstiness
A far-out otherworldliness
And one day this might hurt me less
But everybody knows I'm still down
Don't tell me what the butcher does
There's no need for the obvious
So ugly, still, it's kinda lush
But everybody knows I made vows
Left feet on the podium
Can't think of an alternate
And hell yeah, I'm the awkwardest
But everybody knows I got bounce

[Breakdown]
(Yeah!)

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
'Lone, getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life

Oh, what a wonderful life

13056,Country Song,Seether,"[Verse 1]
Well, I can't stand to look at you now
This revelation's out of my hands
Still, I can't bear the thought of you now
This complication's leaving me scared

Stay when you think you want me
Pray when you need advice
Hey, keep your sickness off me
Tryin' to get through
Blame all your weakness on me
Shame that I'm so contrite
Hey keep your fingers off me
Why can't I get through?

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you have the best of intentions
I cannot shake the taste of blood in my mouth

[Chorus]
(Hey) I keep on thinking that it's
(Hey) All done and all over now
You keep on thinking you can save me, save me
(Hey) My ship is sinking but it's
(Hey) All good and I can't go down
You got me thinking that the party's all over

[Verse 2]
Well, I can't stand to be with myself
This liberation's seemingly rare
And I can't stand the taste of your mouth
This sublimation's outta my hands

You stay cause you think you want me
Pray when you need advice
Hey, keep your sickness off me
(I'm tryin' to get through)
Shame you could take this from me
Bane on an empty mind
Hey, keep your fingers off me
Why can't I get through?

[Chorus]
(Hey) I keep on thinking that it's
(Hey) All done and all over now
You keep on thinking you can save me, save me
(Hey) My ship is sinking but it's

Lay down, just stay down
Lay down because I'm trying to get through

Say what you want, but you're not gonna win this time
Take what you want, but just leave me alive
Say what you want, but you're not gonna win this time
Take what you want, but just leave me alive

(Hey) I keep on thinkin' that it's

You keep on thinking you can save me, save me

13096,Unsainted,Slipknot,"[Intro]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 1]
I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 2]
Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

[Bridge]
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

How dare you martyr me?

13055,Remedy,Seether,"[Verse 1]
Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me
And speak, but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore, you see
It aches in every bone
I'll die alone, but not for you
My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing
I know it's me, you fear
If you want me, hold me back

Frail, the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

[Verse 2]
I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away
So come, sit by the fire and play a while
But you can't stay too long
It aches in every bone
I'll die alone, but not for pleasure
I see my heart explode
It's been eroded by the weather here
If you want me, hold me back

Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

Hold your eyes closed, take me in

13089,Rorschach,Zero Theorem,"You believe what you project onto
Your past taints another child
You waste your time in debate
Judging ink or a lack of branding
Close the door to any other way
You let nobody explain

Forgiveness is a privilege to earn

How are you the voice of the people
When you think you are not equal?
It’s too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes
How are you the voice of the people
When you feed us lies to believe you?
It’s too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes

You think that you need an audience
You think that fear will spread the doubt
I think you've lost your way
What you see is not completely broken
Outward scars will fade in time
But inward cuts remain

Forgiveness is a privilege to earn

How are you the voice of the people
When you think you are not equal?
It’s too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes
How are you the voice of the people
When you feed us lies to believe you?
It’s too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes

You painted yourself in the corner
You burned the bridge
Suffer the life you give
Who will take you out of the restraints
When the ink in your eyes has dried?

How are you the voice of the people
When you think you are not equal?
It’s too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes
How are you the voice of the people?
You don’t even understand
It’s too late to sympathize
Now that you see the world through my eyes

My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage, doing shots
Tip the man, he'll ring the bell
Get her drunk, she'll scream like hell
Dirty girl, gettin' down, dance with guys from outta town
Grab her ass, actin' tough, mess with her, she'll fuck you up

No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight

[Chorus]
She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend

Red thong, party's on, love this song, sing along
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home

I say, no one really knows just how far she's gonna go
But I'm gonna find out later tonight

Doesn't take her long to make things right
But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life?
The time of her life

My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it

She's a gold digger, now you figure out it's over, pull the trigger
Futures finished, there it went, savings gone, the money spent
Look around and all I see, no good, bad, and ugly
Man she's hot and fixed to be the future ex-Miss Connolly

She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat

13066,Anthem Of The Lonely,Nine Lashes,"[Verse 1]
A heart made of stone
Callus and bone
Fracture and tear it out
To let it go
And to think I called it my own
And I would have never thought
The pain could grow

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll break it
Knowing what you said
The pain is what you make it
Sadly, you are so mistaken
I will take it with a grain
And step into the changes
Throw away the empty heart

[Chorus]
Right now, never want to leave this place
And right now, see it in a different way
So right now, even if you take me on
I'll stand, the lonely
Stand, the lonely

It's harder to know just where to go
If only the stars aligned
The sunsets glowed
I don't need the calm in a storm
Or something to scream about
With empty lungs

So I'll break it
Knowing what you said
The pain is what you make it
Sadly you are so mistaken
I will take it with a grain

Always yearning
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning

If you're looking for love
But there's no girl who's burning the ice away from my heart
Maybe tonight

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning
Big city, big city nights

13120,The Future Never Dies,Scorpions,"[Verse 1]
I'm lost in your eyes
Reaching out to cross the great divide
You are drifting away
Mind and soul and body day by day
Nothing's stopping you and I
It's do or die tonight

[Chorus]
So tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together
On a night that's so cold
And you're just a touch away
Baby try to hold on
Until we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies

[Verse 2]
I've been dying inside
Holding back the tears I never cried
Now I'm down on my knees
Because everything you are is what I need
You're the meaning of it all
Don't let me fall you've got to

[Chorus]
So tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together
On a night that's so cold
And you're just a touch away
Baby try to hold on
Until we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies

[Verse 3]
We've got to come together
Because everybody needs a heart to hold
Can't you see it's now or never
Because we've got nowhere else to go
Tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together

[Outro]
Baby try to hold on
Until we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies
We're alive
And the future never dies
In your eyes
The future never dies

13118,Walking On The Edge,Scorpions,"[Verse 1]
Welcome to a trip into my hurt feelings
To the centre of my soul
You better bring a light to find the house of meanings
In the labyrinth of yes or no

[Bridge]
For you, life is just like chess
If you don't make the move
You'll lose the game like this

'Cause you, you're walking on the edge
You, you choose the way of love and pain
You, don't you see the bridge I've built for you
It's just one step to start again

Welcome to a trip into my emotions
To the language of my heart
You're sailing on a river that becomes an ocean
Which you can only cross with love

You'll lose the game like this

13125,Your Light,Scorpions,"When you're feeling lost and blue
When there is no love for you
You'll find him and it's all right
It's all right
It's all right

When you're feeling down and low
When you've got no place to go
And when no one smiles hello
He's by your side, you know

When you're getting deaf and blind
When you drag one leg behind
And when you're finally gonna lose your mind
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

'Cause he is by your side
'Cause he will be your guide
'Cause he will be your light
And you're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone

13121,Every Minute Every Day,Scorpions,"[Verse 1]
Well it seems that I was lost in intoxicated nights
Following the trace of ecstasy
With no future and no past, just the present was alive
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream

I was drowning in a feeling that obsession rules
Till the morning kills the creatures of the night
And I read your lipstick message on the mirror of the truth
Now that you're gone, I realize

Without you
Life's like a song without music
Without you
This world won't be the same

[Chorus]
I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay

[Verse 2]
Well I know that I was lost in a nightmare of my life
Following the flash of fantasy
In a feeling that exploded I'd left reality behind
Addicted to the power of the dream

Without you
Life's like that road that leads nowhere
Without you
The world won't feel the same

[Chorus]
I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay

Without you
Life's like a song without music
Without you
This world won't be the same

[Chorus]
I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay

I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay

13129,In Search Of The Peace Of Mind,Scorpions,"When I'm alone I'm feeling blue
Dreaming a dream of a world that's lovely and true

Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world
And no one will care as long as the world will turn

Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world
And no one will care as long as the world will turn

And I know a place to go to find my peace of mind
And I know a place to find my peace of mind

And I try
And I try
And I try
And I try

Down, I am down
On the ground, sad and tired
I'm down, it's over now
Yes I'm down, should I like it?

[Chorus]
It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Since we've been apart

[Verse 2]
Is this love that comes around
That takes me up light years higher?
Because I, I want to feel love
Once again

[Chorus]
It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Since we've been apart

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Since we've been apart

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
It's deep and dark
Since we've been apart

It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart

13109,Follow Your Heart,Scorpions,"Have you ever climbed the mountain?
Have you ever crossed the sea?
Take a look around the corner
And listen to your heartbeat

Have you ever touched the rainbow
Take a ride in the ferris wheel
It takes one step to start a journey
It's up to you, to make it real

This is the time for yourself to be free
You gotta follow your heart
This is the time in your life and it's never too late
To see the light in the dark
You gotta follow your heart

Walking far away horizons
You will never walk alone
You'll be at home where your heart is
A million miles away from home

Show me the way, who knows the way
This is the only road to go
Life brings me down, it takes me up
And only, only heaven knows

Away from home
Away from home

It belongs to you, it says
Don't cry, no need to be sad

And no death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows

While your traces disappear
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive

I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down

In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their guns and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dying

What's in your head, in your head?

Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

13104,MZRY,Crown The Empire,"[Verse 1]
All along I was scared to breathe
So afraid that the world was gonna leave me behind
In the dark, I refused to see
That I was barely alive
It's such a bitter pill to swallow
But I learned to call it ""reality""
I didn't wanna wake up, I didn’t wanna wake up
I didn't wanna wake up and miss the misery

[Verse 2]
All along I refused to believe
Paranoid that my fear already left me to die
In the end, when I stopped, I could see
That I was feeding the lie
Caught in between another time and place
When no one cared to know my name
Feels like it's never enough
When is it ever enough?

[Pre-Chorus]
I build it up just to tear it back down again
Fighting fate only to surrender, only to surrender

[Chorus]
I'm the worst at letting go
To the scars I loved the most
Will they bury me, bury me now?
Running from the worst in me
Left me broken, wondering
Will they bury me, bury me now?

[Bridge]
It's such a bitter pill to swallow
But I learned to call it ""reality""
I didn't wanna wake up, I didn't wanna wake up
I didn't wanna wake up
It's such a bitter pill to swallow
But I learned to call it ""reality""
I didn't wanna wake up, I didn't wanna wake up
I didn't wanna wake up and miss the misery

[Breakdown]
I hold the key to escaping my reality
I hold the key to creating my identity

[Pre-Chorus]
I build it up just to tear it back down again
Fighting fate only to surrender, only to surrender

[Chorus]
I'm the worst at letting go
To the scars I loved the most
Will they bury me, bury me now?
Running from the worst in me
Left me broke and wondering
Will they bury me, bury me now?
Will they bury me, bury me now?
They won't bury me, bury me now

13134,Sound of Madness,Shinedown,"[Intro]
Yeah, I get it you're an outcast
Always under attack
Always comin' in last
Bringin' up the past
No one owes you anything
I think you need a shotgun blast
A kick in the ass
So paranoid, watch your back
Oh my, here we go

[Verse 1]
Another loose cannon gone bipolar
Slipped down, couldn't get much lower
Quicksand's got no sense of humor
I'm still laughin' like hell

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that by cryin' to me
Lookin' so sorry that I'm gonna believe
You've been infected by a social disease
Well, then take your medicine

[Chorus]
I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself

[Verse 2]
I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality
If there's an afterlife, then it'll set you free
But I'm not, gonna part the seas
You're a self-fulfilling prophecy

[Pre-Chorus]
You think, that by cryin' to me
Lookin' so sorry that I'm gonna believe
You've been infected, by a social disease
Well, then take your medicine

[Chorus]
I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself

Well I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up... when you gonna wake up
And fight

[Chorus]
I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself

[Outro]
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself
When you gonna wake up and fight

And the sun begins to shine
The day did sneak up on the night
I see your face and I see myself
And I get a little taste of life
I try to stand it for awhile

But I'm in a trance
Hey, baby, tell me, can't you hear me calling?

I close my eyes
I think today it's getting better with a sip of wine
And I can stand it for awhile

13122,Alien Nation,Scorpions,"[Verse 1]
In the heat of the violence
The night's exploding everywhere
When hate pulls the trigger
The devil comes to take his share
In the garden of Eden
The time is running out so fast
Into heart of the demon
With no escape our die is cast

[Chorus 1]
In the city of angels
Death is just a moment away
In the city of angels
Your future won't see the light of the day

[Chorus 2]
Beware of the alien nation
Beware of the truth that they seek
They pray for eternal salvation
They pray for your soul to keep

[Verse 2]
On the eve of destruction
A reign of terror rules the street
When the heads start rolling
The devil comes to let it bleed

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]
Walk on past the alien nation
Walk on to the end of your reach
No fear of the alien nation
No fear of the hatred they preach

[Verse 3]
Don't run, there's no place to hide
Today or tomorrow it will get you
Don't move, the knife is right at your throat
And whatever you do, there's no way out
When the shroud comes down on this place
To bury us all alive
We'll know the time has come, to face the heat

13100,Cross Off,Mark Morton,"[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Cross off the days gone
Cross off the days gone
Gone by

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Wasting away
A self-inflicted slow decay
What should've been, what never was
Became the end for both of us

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger)
Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger)
So lay them all to waste
Years you decided to erase
And cross off the days

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Cutting you free
The phantom limb was part of me
You have lived, you have lost
The separation's worth the cost

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Heavy are the words that go unspoken (Spoken)
Heavy are the promises now broken (Broken)
Will you learn to love the taste
Of the destruction in your wake?
Cross off the days

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Gone by
Making my way back from the madness
Shifting my thoughts from the blackness
And the sadness, but the fact is
I'm swinging through life like a clenched fist
Fuck sanity, I wanna bleed
Can't kill the pain, it's everything
It's all I feel, it's what I breathe
Turn the hate I breed into what I need
Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger)
Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger)

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Did you survey everything you laid to waste
And cross off the days?

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by

13136,Stranger In My House,Ronnie Milsap,"[Verse 1]
There's a silence here between us
I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

[Verse 2]
She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's alright
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know?
Or somebody she just met?
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

[Verse 3]
Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination?
Or has her love turned into lies?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
A stranger in my house

13140,Hallowed Be Thy Name,Iron Maiden,"[Intro]
I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah

[Verse 1]
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

[Verse 2]
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall, but why am I crying?
After all, I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, ""God be with you""
If there's a God, why has He let me go?
As I walk, my life drifts before me
And though the end is near, I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

[Verse 4]
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah

And start your slavin' jobs and get your pay

If you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a secondhand guitar, chances are you'll go far

You tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid and we're all self-employed

Has been shaken to the top""

He went a-cruising down the ville
The Muezzin was a-standing on the radiator grille

By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
The Bedouin, they brought out
The electric kettle drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar-picking thumb
As soon as the Sharif
Cleared the square
They began to wail

Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah

Now over at the temple
Oh, they really pack 'em in
The in-crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff of that crazy Casbah jive

Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rocking the Casbah, rock the Casbah

He said, ""You better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way""

Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Sharif was
Out of their hair

13171,You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet,Bachman-Turner Overdrive,"I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said I had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way

I think that any love is good lovin' and
So I took what I could get mmh
Oooh, oooh, she looked at me with big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen nothin' yet
Here's something that you never gonna forget
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen nothin' yet

And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure

He said that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with big brown eyes and said

You ain't seen nothin' yet

Ain't that something going around then?

Better be good

In a room where you do what you don't confess

If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs

And she don't always say what she really means

Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake

Yeow
Yeow

[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah

[Verse 3]
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah

And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
Mmm, yeah

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
Mmm, yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game

Wanna tell you a story
About the house-rent blues

[Verse 1]
I come home one Friday
Had to tell the landlady I done lost my job
She said, ""That don't befront me
Long as I get my money next Friday""
Now, next Friday come, I didn't get the rent
And out the door I went

[Verse 2]
So I goes to the landlady
I said, ""You let me slide?
I'll have the rent for ya tomorrow, the next day, I don't know""
So she let me slide it on, you know, people
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me
But for five year she was so nice
Lord, she was lovey-dovey

[Verse 3]
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said, ""You got the rent money yet?""
I said, ""No, can't find no job
Therefore, I ain't got no money to pay the rent""
She said, ""I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job""
Said, ""I seen you today, you were standin' on a corner
Leaning up against a post""
I said, ""But I'm tired
I been walkin' all day""
She said, ""That don't confront me
Long as I get my money next Friday""
Now, next Friday come, I didn't have the rent
And out the door I went

[Verse 4]
So I go down the streets
Down to my good friend's house
I said, ""Look, man, I'm outdoors, you know
Can I stay with you maybe a couple of days?""
He said, ""Ah, let me go and ask my wife""
He come out of the house
I could see it in his face, I know that was ""No""
He said, ""Ah, I don't know, man, ah, she kinda funny, you know""
I said, ""I know, everybody funny
Now you funny too""

[Verse 5]
So I go back home
I tell the landlady, ""I got a job, I'm gonna pay the rent""
She said, ""Yeah?"", I said, ""Oh yeah""
And then she was so nice
Lord, she was lovey-dovey

[Verse 6]
So I go in my room, pack up my things, and I go
I slip on out the back door, and down the streets I go
She a-howlin' about the front rent
She'll be lucky to get any back rent
She ain't gonna get none of it

[Verse 7]
So I stop in the local bar, you know, people
I go to the bar, I ring my coat, I call the bartender
Said, ""Look, man, come down here""
He got down there, ""So what you want?""

[Chorus]
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Well, I ain't seen my baby since I don't know when
I've been drinking bourbon, whiskey, scotch, and gin
Gonna get high, man, I'm gonna get loose
Need me a triple-shot of that juice
Gonna get drunk, don't you have no fear
I want one bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

[Verse 8]
But I'm sitting now
At the bar
I'm getting drunk
I'm feelin' mellow
I'm drinkin' bourbon, I'm drinkin' scotch, I'm drinkin' beer
Looked down the bar
Here come the bartender
I said, ""Look, man, come down here""
""So what you want?""

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
No, I ain't seen my baby since the night before last
Gotta get a drink, man, I'm gonna get gassed
Gonna get high, man, I ain't had enough
Need me a triple shot of that stuff
Gonna get drunk, won't you listen right here?
I want one bourbon, one shot, and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Well, all right

[Bridge]
Yeah
Scratch my back, baby
Yeah

[Verse 9]
Now, by this time I'm plenty high
You know, when your mouth a-getting dry, you're plenty high
Looked down the bar, I see to my bartender
I said, ""Look, man, come down here""
He got down there, ""So what you want this time?""
I said, ""Look, man, a-what time is it?""
He said, ""The clock on the wall say three o'clock
A-last call, for alcohol; so what you need?""

[Chorus]
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
Lord, I ain't seen my baby since a-nigh on a week
Gotta get drunk, man, so I can't even speak

I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won

I guess my race is run
Well, she's the best girl I've ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

A-robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I miss my baby and-a good fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
Well, she's the best girl I've ever had
I fought the law and the law won

Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled

Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
I spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no

Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never

13154,Kiss from a Rose,Wake Me,"There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
There is so much a man can tеll you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my plеasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray

I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain

""Maybe I should announce it, should I?
Memory of a free festival""

[Verse 1]
The children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

[Verse 2]
Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

[Verse 3]
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same

[Verse 4]
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road, unchained

[Outro]
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party

13156,Over The Hills And Far Away,Gary Moore,"They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

They marched him to the station house
He waited till the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
""You stand accused of robbery,""
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Just where he'd been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms again he'll be
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills and
Over the hills and
Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms again she'll be

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
As sure as the river reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the sea
Back in her arms is where he'll be

Over the hills
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills
Over the hills and far away

Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon

Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand

Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb

Man intensely struggles with a leopard to contend

We, the lions slaughter the leopards in a match
The tiger beats the leopard in a contest
The elephant trounces the leopard in a fight
Man strenuously strains with a leopard in contention

An instigator, the jealousy of a snake it could be
And Khan Garuda leaps up above into the air
A growl, the jealousy of a tiger it could be
The blue wolf comes too from far away

Hu - hu - hu - hu...

Provoked, the snow leopard competes with it's rivals

Ten thunderbolts strike at the same time
A hundred hearts energized in the thundering roar
Simultaneously a thousand colliding thunderbolts
And too, ten thousand lightning strikes in the heavens

Hu - hu - hu - hu...
Hu - hu - hu - hu...

This deluge is the leopard battling in a deadly fight
The surges of the leopard scuffling in competion
The awesome leopard swats, blows to overthrow
The glistening leopard slashes in the scramble

Hu - hu - hu - hu...

With the speed of the falcon advancing
The wolf's courage at times flaring up
The strength of horses hooves, their paces pounding
The mark of Genghis Khan, an overwhelming impression

This is our time, I hear the sound
Of a thousand drums

Would you join me in the fight, fight for our lives?
Oh, scream out loud, this is our house
Oh, please, join me in the fight, the fight for our lives
Oh, scream out loud, this is our house

This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud, this is our house
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud, this is our house
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud, this is our house

13249,Guerrilla Radio,Rage Against The Machine,"[Verse 1]
Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio

[Verse 2]
Contact, I hijacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway, move on DC
Way past the days of bombin' MCs
Sound off, Mumia, guan, be free
Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
Army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out the box, it's my radio dial

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up

It has to start somewhere
It has to start sometime
What better place than here?
What better time than now?

All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now

13214,333,HELLYEAH,"[Chorus]
My goddamn life's been torn to pieces
Been stolen, been cheated, been broken, been beaten
Shadows in the belly of death come creeping
With arms outstretched, just come and take me
Fuck it all, fuck off, fuck life, I’m leaving

[Verse 1]
Life is like a razor slowly dragging down my wrist
Holding tight to my existence, clenched up like a fist
I've let my past control me and destroy me, I'm unraveled
Heart beating like a hammer, shaping iron on an anvil
My head screams, my ears bleed, I’m trapped inside a riot
My mind held in captivity from the mutiny of the pirates
I'm shaking like a rattle can in the hand of a vandal
I'm burning like the fuse on a bomb you can't dismantle

[Chorus]
My goddamn life's been torn to pieces
Been stolen, been cheated, been broken, been beaten
Shadows in the belly of death come creeping
With arms outstretched, just come and take me
Fuck it all, fuck off, fuck life, I'm leaving

[Verse 2]
Time is like a noose slowly slipping around my neck
All humanity has done for me is show me disrespect
Frenetic confrontation is the road I gotta travel
Fuck complacency, conformity, I don't lay down, I battle
Come with reckless abandon full of reckless intent
Without a care, without restraint, and now I'm fucking bent
Malevolent and violent to the marrow in my bones
If you’re not helping me, you’re hurting me, and pain is what you're owed

[Chorus]
My goddamn life’s been torn to pieces
Been stolen, been cheated, been broken, been beaten
Shadows in the belly of death come creeping
With arms outstretched, just come and take me
Fuck it all, fuck off, fuck life, I'm leaving

[Bridge]
Welcome to the Slamboree
Fuck every motherfucker who ain't you or me
Welcome to the family
We're the root of half evil repping 333
Welcome to the Slamboree
If you’re not in the club, it must suck to be
Welcome to the family
We're the root of half evil repping 333 (333)

My goddamn life's been torn to pieces

13220,Mama Said Knock You Out,Five Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1: Ivan Moody]
Don't call it a comeback
I've been here for years
Rockin' my peers
Putting suckers in fear
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion (Explosion), overpowering
Over the competition, we're towering
Record? Shock, when I drop these lyrics
That'll make you call them cops (What?)
Don't you dare stare, you better move (Move)
Don't ever compare
Us to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition paying our price

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Shadowboxing, when I heard you on the radio
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new toy
I'm going insane
Starting a hurricane releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain or maintain
Unless you say my name (A'ight)
Rippin', killin', diggin' and drillin' a hole
Past your soul

[Chorus: Ivan Moody]
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Knock you out)
I'm gonna knock you out

13239,Straight Jacket,Theory of a Deadman,"[Verse 1]
I wear a 36 long, white is my color
A little tight in the shoulder
But you know, it still fit me good
I wear a 36 long, white is my color
A little tight in the shoulder
But you know, it still fit me good

Anyone can see we're a perfect match
An innocent boy and a psychopath
A week's worth of dating and you talk about moving in
(I talk about moving too fast)
My mom disapproved and my friends would say
To break the girl's heart but I'm too afraid
Her clickbait body was a tractor beam
She was a Tesla Model S with the ludicrous speed
The sex was good but we always fight
I'd try to leave your sorry ass but end up spending the night
Your sweetness, my weakness, you're mean though ingenious
Nothing can go between us (Aye, have you seen us?)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've lost it, you're toxic, I botched this, I'm nauseous
Man, I gotta be

[Chorus]
Out of my mind, be going crazy
'Cause it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my brain
Hallucinating
Girl, well it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my mind

[Verse 2]
Free at last, I'm free at last
Something I'll never say is ""I'm free at last""
She ain't around so I can vent and get it off my chest
(So here we go, three, two, one)
And you're supercali-pessimistic-expiali-narcissistic
You are Mary Poppins, you'll be soon be going out of business
Guys, let me witness, you got a Honda Civic
'Cause you're backseat driving my life

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna sleep my life away
I must be

[Chorus]
Out of my mind, be going crazy
'Cause it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my brain
Hallucinating
Girl, well it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

[Verse 3]
I'm freaking out, I'm panic attacking
Yeah, I mentally had it, now my living room's padded
I'm a sadist, I'm addicted to this heroin
You're Tonya Harding and I'm your Nancy Kerrigan
Like Lloyd Braun, I just wanted serenity
But you had to go testing me, gave me suicide tendencies
Your little games, your little, little games
You tricked me into staying, your playing is getting lame
From touching your sweet things to tracking your calls
Go from smacking your ass to punching holes in the walls
Go from sending me fire news to eyeing up other dudes
From picking a favorite song to playlisting breaking tunes
Started so high, now I can hardly breathe
Go from weak in the knees to be too weak I can't leave
You called it, it's all my fault, this I know
Guess I'm better off dead inside than being alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna sleep my life away
Oh!

[Chorus]
I must be out of my mind, be going crazy
'Cause it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my brain
Hallucinating
Girl, well it doesn't faze me
Yeah, the way you treat me so bad
I must be out of my mind

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, oh
I must be out of my mind

And you're supercali-pessimistic-expiali-narcissistic
You are Mary Poppins, you'll be soon be going out of business

Yeah, oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

Different visions, contradictions
Why won't you let me out?

I need a way to separate
But I promised you that I'll make sure you never forget me

It's dark outside, a world on fire that no one's safe from
It's life or death, so hold your breath or suffocate them
Provoking fears with smoke and mirrors, the tension's rising
We waste our time and wait in line while nothing changes

[Pre-Chorus]
But nothing changes
Until the people get loud

[Chorus]
So get down
Everybody, everybody, get down
Take it to another level right now
No resolution
Stand up, this is renegade music
Everybody, everybody, get down
Take back your life right now
Are you ready for some new shit?
Stand up, this is renegade music
This is renegade music

A house in flames is not contained, the neighbors watching
But no one moves, they live by rules that give no options
We don't prevail, can tell no tales, a dead man walking
To replicate is playing safe, and nothing changes

But nothing changes
Until the people get loud

And the pain is overwhelming
It's a faultline
And yeah, I'm guessing
That I should be kinda happy
It's a fault of mine

With all the tension
You still keep me second-guessing
'Cause I'm so benign

And yeah, I know
It's kinda hard to let it go

With no one there to guide me

A whisper and a scream
A suicide machine of my own making

Like needles in my veins
Consumed in your embrace
There's no escaping

My fix is the misery
Won't stop till the end of me
I can't feel anything

Half coma, half awake
My soul is yours to take
A waist-full river

I feel you under my skin
The knife is twisting within
Temptation always wins
It's never over

You drove the stake in my worst mistake
Now I'm the one left alone
Brought out the evil that's the devil in me
And now I'm on my own
Inside the dark unknown
You told the lie you believed in me
Lights dimming low, lost the glow
You are the sin and so sinister
I'm just the soul you owe
The who you left unwhole

I defy your defiance
It's all lies in alliance

Heaven's sake is forsaken
Didn't create all creation
I've designed my undoing
Because I'm broken, flawed, and just human

You were the anger in all my danger
Old habits keep me this cold
You killed the light that enlightened me
My ark of dark afloat

Stab my stability, I'm my worst enemy

But I know it in my heart
That I won't be, be broken

You pushed me off to that dark space
Between a rock and a hard place
You hoped you found what would slow me down
But there ain't no stopping my heart rate
It could've been easy to part ways
But now you just feed me this parfait
Of bullshit with your lies mixed in
You can keep your games at the arcade

[Pre-Chorus: Danny Case & Matt Brandyberry]
It's nothing new to me, what you do to me
I've seen it all time and time again

Didn't believe in my statements?
I dimmed the lights and I hid from life
And just buried the dreams that I'm chasing?
Who would I be if I wasted
Days and weeks in the basement?
If I up and quit and said, ""Fuck this shit""
How would I reach amazing?

The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space

[Verse 2]
What if I say to you: ""Let's leave this earth for a while""
A perspective from the hollow and the wheel we can't control

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't tell you what to do, this crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become, we'll be outlaws on the run

[Chorus]
Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space

[Post-Chorus]
And the emptiness in space
And the emptiness in space

[Bridge]
When we were young, was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing, we need to find our way back
When we were young, was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing, we need to find our way back
When we were young, was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing, we need to find our way back

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't tell you what to do, this crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become, we'll be outlaws on the run

[Chorus]
Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space

13211,Do You Really Want It,Nothing More,"[Intro]
Do you really want it?

[Verse 1]
We say give me a high, oh God, give me a feeling
('Cause I've lost my reason)
We say, give me a push, a push through this
(Concrete ceiling)
We say, give me a sign that proves what I believe in
(A psychic reading)
So I can shake these American demons
Give me, give me, give me

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to change the world
But one thing's clear
No one ever wants to change themselves
That's the way things are
All because we hate the buzzkill
Jaded when we need to feel
But we can change it all if you really want it

[Post-Chorus]
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
Ka, ka, ka, ka

[Verse 2]
You gotta bite the bullet till your gums are bleeding
(Grab the mic and scream it)
You gotta dig up the past to get past this
(Anxious feeling)
You gotta get ripped apart to see why you're breathing
(To find your reason)
So I can shake these American demons
Give me, give me, give me

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to change the world
But one thing's clear
No one ever wants to change themselves
That's the way things are
All because we hate the buzzkill
Jaded when we need to feel
But we can change it all
If you really want it
Then we can change it all

[Post-Chorus]
Do you really want it?
Do ya, do ya?
Do you really want it?
Do ya, do ya?
So I can shake these American demons
Screaming, screaming, screaming

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to change the world
But one thing's clear
No one ever wants to change themselves
That's the way things are
All because we hate the buzzkill
Jaded when we need to feel
But we can change it all
We can change it all
If you really want it
If you really want it
Everybody wants to change the world
No one ever wants to change themselves
Everybody wants to change the world
No one ever wants to change themselves
Everybody wants to change the world
No one ever wants to change themselves

13228,House On Fire,Rise Against,"[Short Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, ""Move!""
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 2]
But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 3]
And how is it a thing?
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting out the rain
Feels like it's gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

[Chorus]
'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I can't let go of you
Of you, of you, of you, of you

13202,Torn in Two,Breaking Benjamin,"[Verse 1]
Is this the way it's got to be?
Ignite the fire inside of me
Embrace the life of tragedy
A tide of war and broken dreams

[Chorus]
I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise
I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

[Verse 2]
Is this the fate we fall between?
Deface the life inside of me
Drain the heart of atrophy
And take away the remedy

[Chorus]
I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise
I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

[Chorus]
I am torn in two (Please hold on)
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
I am faded through (Please hold on)
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise
I will fight this war for you (Please hold on)
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

[Outro]
Hold on
Rise
Hold on
Rise
Hold on
Rise
Hold on

13200,Oh My God,HELLYEAH,"[Verse 1]
The little boy in me that was wild with fright
Nobody came to my rescue when I called out that night
So many times, so many tries, so many cries for help in life
But it's too late now

[Chorus]
Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and here I come
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
'Cause I'm the bullet, and he's the gun

[Verse 2]
The struggle is real (It's so real)
My condition's critical in life, was I born to suffer 'til I die?
Darkness consumes me (It consumes me)
Draw the shades and stitch my eyes, watch my sanity unwind

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been drained of compassion
My finger's up, fuck the masses

[Chorus]
Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood

I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
'Cause I'm the bullet, and he's the gun

[Verse 3]
My hands off the wheel (Hands off the wheel)
Your process is complete, destroyed what matters most to me
The burden holds me (Holds on to me)
I'm just a product of my past, I'm like a book with one last match

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been drained of compassion
My finger's up, fuck the masses

[Chorus]
Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun

I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
'Cause I'm the bullet, and he's the gun

I've been drained of compassion
My finger's up, fuck the masses

But a dirty black cloud comin' out of the blue?
I was wrong, I was right
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night

13205,Truth To the Weak,Fire From The Gods,"[Intro Chorus]
Giving up ain't an option
I'm  not built to collapse
But  I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die

[Verse 1]
(Yeah, speak them facts)
Yeah,  let me testify I'm still coming through
From  the bottom of the gutter
I put my all into this, yo that's word to my mother
Fuck  pageantry, I'm coming raw with the savagery
Addressing that cannibal mind that's trying to consume me
Get off of me
I'm trying to be the best that I can be
Take  a seat, I'll take an evolutionary leap
Kick knowledge to the powerless
While you commence retreat
Let it be, take the ""L"" admit defeat

[Pre-Chorus]
Let that boy speak
He bringing truth to the weak
Tell him

[Chorus]
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die

[Verse 2]
I told you before I don't break
But you looking at me like I got a target on my back
That shot you take
Here you go again trying to put me in my place
Let me remind you that man is a beast and not a waste
Question, how come you don't want to see me fly?
Why you tryna drag me in the ditch where the dead lie?
Why you wanna turn my body cold?
Deal me a shitty hand and then laugh when I fold

[Chorus]
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die

[Bridge]
I won't give in
I won't lay down or die
Nah

[Verse 3]
When I speak, I'm tryna bring truth to the weak walk with my head up, defeat I always see
Creeping in the shadow of my periphery
I'm keeping all the leeches out of my vicinity
Always keep it a hundo so they cannot challenge me
Expanding on my vision, find the truth that I now seek
I've seen it all, I have swam against the current
I've been through the trenches, I've also felt worthless
I turn my back on the bottom
I can't quit, I elevate
I'm passing through all my limits

[Pre-Chorus]
Now let that boy speak
He bringing truth to the weak
Tell him

[Chorus]
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die
Giving up ain't an option
I'm not built to collapse
But I'll take what I'm given
I won't lay down and die

13244,Rose Red Violent Blue,Stone Sour,"[Verse 1]
Excuse me, oh, pardon me, I'm
Still sticky on the inside
There comes a time when all I do
Is sit around in contemplation
And curse my situation
I'm just too bored for normal news

Be careful of what you wish for
Impossible to just ignore
One last time is all I need
To get my laughing stocks in order
They're on the rise this quarter
Beware of certain friends who sell you out
When everything is free

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I am to all of you
And I've got all these other things to do, to do

[Chorus]
Open up, I know enough; I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only youth
But I am much too old, I am much too old
I am much too old now...

[Verse 2]
Imagine this chaos theory
Makes all the prophets leery
Somebody's showing them the ropes...
Ooh, we use to hang ourselves with
Instead of quiet respites
We choose the noose in lieu of hope
Oh, rose red, oh, violent blue
I should've seen the clues
But this song is dumb and so am I

[Pre-Chorus]
Character assassinations
Aren't really observations
Stay home and ask yourself:
""Why am I so low when I'm so high, so high?""

[Chorus]
Open up, I know enough; I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only youth
But I am much too old, I am much too old
I am much too old now...

[Bridge]
Yeah!
Come on!

[Chorus]
Open up, I know enough; I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only youth
But I am much too old, I am much too old
I am much too old, I am much too old

Look up and see that motherfucking writing on the wall
When you see J3T thirty deep, he's down to brawl
Fuck the haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fucking disease
I got HU tatted on the front of my arms
The boulevard, brass knuckles in the back of the car
'Cause we drunk-drive Cadillacs, we never go far
But when you see us, motherfuckers, better know who we are
I got one thing to say to punk-asses who hate
Motherfuckers don't know, but you better watch what you say
From these industry fucks to these faggot-ass punks
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk
I'm already loud, maybe it's a little too late
Johnny's taking heads off of all faggots who hate
'Cause I'm a God, motherfucker, there's a price to pay
Yeah, I'm a god, motherfucker, and it's Judgment Day

[Chorus: Deuce & All]
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
I'm getting used to this nuisance of fags who badmouth this music
How fucking stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this
You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it
I took the chance, I paid the bill, I nearly died for this music
You make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit
You're tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrists, get pissed, and go jump off a bridge
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky, didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kid's lips
That shit's as worse as it gets, this verse is over, I quit
Signed ""Charlie Scene"" on your girlfriend's tits

[Chorus: Deuce & All]
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

[Verse 3: J-Dog]
White boys with tattoos, p-pointing right at you
We're breaking everything, r-rowdy like a classroom
Pack of wolves 'cause we don't follow the rules
And when you're running your mouth, our razor blades come out
Because there's nothing in my life except my dick and what I spit
So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots talking shit
Speaking of fag, already rapped with the drag
We killed him then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac
B-But you always press and you know I never stress
With Loki DMS, J-Johnny to my left
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
I grew up on drive-bys and LA gang signs
So what the fuck you know about being a gangster?
And what the fuck you know about being in danger?
You ain't doing this so you know you're just talking shit
Mad at all of us 'cause every song is a fucking hit

[Chorus: Deuce & All]
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway

Motherfucking time to ride, ride

Won't you punks just die, die, die?

13248,Digging My Own Grave,Escape the Fate,"[Intro]
Pulling me, I can't breathe
Rescue me, darkness consuming
Tempting me, suffering
Break me free from the darkness inside me

[Verse 1]
Shadows take my hands as my mind begins to stray
I'm lost in captive eyes, I can't seem to look away
Testing my will, trying my faith
I'm drenched in my sins, I am dripping with shame
Defying my reasons, denying my heart
I descend to hellfire, I am torn apart

[Chorus]
I need somebody to deliver me from hell
I can't seem to find myself, I could use some help
Deliver me from hell

[Verse 2]
The serpent sends a smile, and the apple is laced
I tiptoe into the void, I long for the taste
The perversive pictures are fixed in my mind
I'm worshipping fiction, the blind lead the blind

[Chorus]
I need somebody to deliver me from hell
I can't seem to find myself, I could use some help
Deliver me from hell

[Bridge]
The Devil whispers to me I'll never be saved
The shovel pushes deeper and deeper, I'm digging my own grave
The Devil whispers to me I'll never be saved
The shovel pushes deeper and deeper, I'm digging my own grave
The Devil whispers to me I'll never be saved
The shovel pushes deeper, I'm digging my own grave
The Devil whispers to me I'll never be saved
The shovel pushes deeper, I'm digging my own grave

Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe

Forever
Forever
Forever

[Verse 1]
For the blood, for the sweat, for the fears and the things that betray us
For the cracks in the mirrors and the ones you bust on the pavement
We're awake in this dream, and we choose to believe
That the you that's in me is in everything
We're alive
We're alive

[Chorus]
It's who we are that keeps me believing
There's something here bigger than ourselves
If I'm wrong then why am I still feeling?
Who we are keeps me believing

[Verse 2]
For the pain, for the strength, for our will to hold on through the changes
From the now till the end, every second we count, we embrace it
As our faces erase and our bodies decay
As we move through the waves that echo our names
We're alive
We're alive

[Chorus]
It's who we are that keeps me believing
There's something here bigger than ourselves
If I'm wrong then why am I still feeling?
Who we are, keeps me believing
Keeps me believing

[Bridge]
One more time we stand together
Never forget why; always remember
One more time we stand together
Always remember
It's who we are
We make it out alive
After all, it's down to you and I

[Chorus]
It's who we are that keeps me believing
There's something here bigger than ourselves
If I'm wrong then why am I still feeling?
Who we are, keeps me believing
Keeps me believing
It keeps me believing
Who we are, keeps me believing
Keeps me believing
Keeps me believing
Keeps me believing

13201,Burn,In Flames,"[Verse 1]
We're in the ruins of dreams
Vultures and their dead-end screams
The fragile sanctuary of home
Spit me out, find another clone
Need a revolution
To find the lost evolution
Waiting for the wind to turn
Avoiding truth and never learn
Never learn, never learn, never learn

[Chorus]
So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes

[Verse 2]
Drop the bombs, build anew
Purge our thoughts for different views
Different mantra, different beat
Still heading for eternal sleep
Devoured by constant pressure
Always for someone else’s pleasure
Not sure what you see in the scope
Afraid we're running out of hope
Out of hope, out of hope, out of hope

[Chorus]
So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes

[Bridge]
In the name of a broken spirit
Fight the boundaries and kill it
Trapped inside the villain of man
Apathy, the sickness in our lifespan

[Chorus]
So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes

Yeah, I think you made me

I give, you take, you always push me away
I love, you hate, it's always, always the same
You're always taking, taking, never giving back
To me, it's in the past, but tell me how you live with that
You always love to hate with every single breath
But since the disconnect, you see the life you wish you had
Yeah, you see the life you wish you had

[Chorus: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
'Cause I hate the way that you make me feel

[Verse 2: Danny Case & Matt Brandyberry]
I can't, I won't, won't bend until I break
I do, you don't, it's always, always the same
All I wanted was for you to understand my mind
I'm over standing by your side, it isn't worth the time
All you wanted was to push me somewhere past the line
Push me somewhere out of sight, push me somewhere out of mind

Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
'Cause I hate the way that you make me feel
Am I going crazy?

On the grounds where we feel safe
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?

[Bridge]
Do we censor, do we flow?
Are we drunk on the chemicals?
Every feeling in my bones tells me to lash out
And tell you to fuck off
You've got my heart
And I've got your soul
But are we better off alone?
With every battle, we lose a little more
Remember everything that we'd die for
You are everything that I'd die for

[Chorus]
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do you feel safe?

13218,Ghost,Badflower,"[Verse 1]
I tried it once before but I didn't get too far
I felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart
And all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
But I waited there forever and nobody even looked up
I tried it once before and I think I might've messed up
I struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough
But maybe I'm alive 'cause I didn't really wanna die
But nothing very special ever happens in my life

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be

[Verse 2]
I tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut
I thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough
And I should've told my mother, ""Mom, I love you,"" like a good son
But this life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be, yeah

[Bridge]
I tried it once again and I think I might black out
I should've left a letter but I had nothing to write about
My blood is all around me, I get dizzy if I stand up
The cutting part was easy but regretting it is so fucked

[Chorus]
Yeah, take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be
I tried it once again and I think I went too far
(The man that I was meant to be)
I cut a little deeper and the pressure stopped my heart
(The man that I was meant to be)
I couldn't tell my mother that I love her, I'm a bad son
This life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one

Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now

The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin'
Quenchin' the thirst of the power dons
That five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger’s cold, empty your purse

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family

[Verse 2]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal, I
Walk the corner to the rubble
That used to be a library, line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family

Oh, you wired me awake and hit me with a hand of broken nails
Yeah, you tied my lead and pulled my chain to watch my blood begin to boil

I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Yeah, I'm gonna break, I'm gonna break my

Hit like a Phillips head into my brain
It's gonna be too dark to sleep again
Cutting my teeth on bars and rusty chains

When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
And when the dogs are lookin' for their bones
And it's rainin' icepicks on your steel shore
Well, I'm gonna break, I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Well, I'm gonna break, I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
And knowing how to change the things you've been through
I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you
This happened to you

[Verse 2]
It's just a problem that I'm faced with; am I
Not the only one who hates to stand by?
Complications that are first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind
Knowing endless consequences
I feel so useless in this
Get back, step back, and as for me
I can't believe

[Chorus]
Part of me, won't agree
'Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
'Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure anymore

Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure

I don't feel so insecure anymore

Why do things that matter the most
Never end up being what we chose

I don't think I knew what I had

Spilling on my soul

Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
And pull my trigger
Free the violence that is building in me
I say now, end of the ride, murder-suicide
Is how I've been feeling lately

Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
I'm reeling with the feeling that I
Can't ignore
Come a little closer now, pretentious whore

The secret side of me
I never let you see
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
So stay away from me
The beast is ugly
I feel the rage, and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls
In the closet, in the halls
It comes awake, and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed
In my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end!

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I hate what I've become!
The nightmare's just begun!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!

[Verse 2]
My secret side I keep
Hid under lock and key
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out
He'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end!

I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I hate what I've become!
The nightmare's just begun!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!

[Bridge]
It's hiding in the dark!
Its teeth are razor-sharp!
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream
Maybe it's just a dream
Maybe it's inside of me
Stop this monster!
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster

[Chorus]
I hate what I've become!
The nightmare's just begun!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I’m gonna lose control!
It’s something radical!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!

Between the two of us

To bring you to your knees

The world's got a funny way of turning 'round on you
When a friend tries to stab you right in the face
Losing faith in everything I thought, I hoped and knew
Don't sweat it
Set a false pretense

[Pre-Chorus]
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
'Ca-ca-ca-ca-cause you know

[Chorus]
In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense, you'll hurt again

[Verse 2]
All along you know you thought you got the best of me
You were wrong and I'm laughing right in your face
I cannot believe you claimed you were my family
Don't sweat it
Set a false pretense

[Pre-Chorus]
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
'Ca-ca-ca-ca-cause you know

[Chorus]
In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Guitar

[Bridge]
Oh, it's time to let it go

I can't seem to understand it
How you've turned out to be so cold
You tried but were caught red-handed
Are you happy with your role?

It's funny to me how you've turned into such a joke

[Chorus]
In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense, you'll hurt again

[Outro]
So play the game until you run out
And play the game into my head

Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

[Chorus: Corey Taylor]
And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

[Post-Chorus: Clown, Chris Fehn, & Paul Gray]
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess? We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
I think we're done, I'm not the only one

[Chorus: Corey Taylor]
And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Define your meanin' of war
To me it's what we do when we're bored
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more
Because I'm hyped up, out of control
If it's a fight, I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I know that I know

It's been a long time comin'
And the tables turned around
'Cause one of us is goin'

One of us is goin' down

Define your meanin' of fun
Is it fuckin', druggin' or guns?
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one

You can treat this like another all the same
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

It'll be a long time comin'

'Cause I was never goin'
Yeah, you're the one that's goin' down

Tell me there's a reason
To take another step
To get up off my knees and
Follow this path of most resistance
And wherever it takes us
Whatever it faces and wherever it leads

So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside

Something for the pain, just to kill this feeling
Although we look awake, inside we're all still sleeping
I've spent my time here alive, but barely there
Do you believe we'll ever make it?
Do you think we'll ever really see?

So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine

Wake me up inside

As it all falls down
Do I walk away?
Or do l stand my ground
And accept my fate?

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing

[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

[Verse 2]
Happiness is found
In the darkest ways
And as I search around
I knew nothing but mistakes

And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing

[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

[Bridge]
And when you scream
You push me so much further ahead
And when I leave
I always walk right back again
And when you cry
The tears are cleansing bitterness
I'm out of time
I'm slowly dying, give me back my life!
Just give me back my life!
Just give me back my life!
Just give me back my lies!

[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?

Some people seem to think
They always know what's best for you
Their little minds try to
Create a world to keep you still
The bolt is thrown, the cage is locked
You saw this, don't you lie
At first you cry and then
You hate those people, stole your will

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(No nothing)

[Chorus]
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

[Verse 2]
So you just sit there stuck
Afraid to risk reality
Afraid to cause yourself
More pain to face insanity
But nothing ventured, nothing gained
You see your fear's your cage
You beg for help but
You're alone stuck in a helpless rage

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario

It's me...
I see...
Please...

Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out

You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario

Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

But I can feel you pushing through beyond the space
So send your energy to me and I'll push through
Send your signal home and bring me back to you

13297,96 Quite Bitter Beings,CKY,"[Verse 1]
With my perceptions in a mix down twenty miles through the sticks
To the cloudy town of Hellview: Population 96
Excessive vacancy, well maybe, in the shadow of an eye
All the strangers passing through and where the rules just don't apply

[Verse 2]
At the fork turn left, a store, but on the right stay free from sight
Cause 96 quite bitter beings like to stack the bodies high
The only way to ever leave is overflooded by the storm
And entanglement in Hellview brings you fear in fifty forms
They've deleted all the tourists at the bottom of the lake
And not one supports the cause to leave the blood stay in the veins

[Hook 1]
Here, three miles back is where we are
All we ever wanted was an answer
Civilized are close but way too far
All we ever wanted was an answer

Footprints giving clue to where we are
All we ever wanted was an answer
Civilized are close but way too far

If you take a step towards me
You will take my breath away
So, I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe
No one else has ever loved me
No one else has ever tried
I never understood how much I could take

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I saw the worst was over
When I laid my eyes on you
It was all that I could do to know my place
Out of all the past illusions
Out of all the dreams come true
I was gone until I finally saw your face

[Chorus]
And if you cried out for more...
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me, too

[Verse 2]
Let me take a step towards you
Let me feel you in my hands
Let me cross this line and show you where it leads
There's a darkness down inside me
That I know we'll both enjoy
And it's screaming from within to set it free

[Pre-Chorus]
I have left this bloody nightmare
In my wake but out of sight
All I want is deviation by design
Out of all the past confusion
Out of all the common spite
Just tell me I am yours, 'cause you are mine

[Chorus]
And if you cried out for more...
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me, too

[Bridge]
It doesn't really matter what you do or say
I'm never goin' anywhere anyway
'Cause when I'm dyin' for you
I've never felt so alive

[Chorus]
And if you cried out for more...
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me, too

I know you saved me, too

13259,We Will Not Go Quietly,Sixx:A.M.,"[Verse 1]
It's like a heart attack, I see the shock when you face it
We couldn't take it so we got a little wasted
I'd really love to see the look on their face
When you open your eyes, when you open your eyes

You run away, then who's gonna save us?
The only people that you find are gonna slay us
I really love to hear sound of your voice
When you're screaming their name, when you're screaming their name

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta burn it down
You gotta blow it up
You gotta give it hell
You gotta pull the plug
And you could run away
Or you could kill the beast
And you could try to kill yourself
But you could never kill me

[Chorus]
Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can burn it again
'Cause we will not go quietly
Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can tell all your friends
That we will not go quietly
(not go quietly)

[Verse 2]
So when you find yourself, you're in a place that you're scared of
You wake up to see a face you wouldn't dare love
They're gonna try to take the blood from your veins
When you open your eyes, when you open your eyes

You run away but who is gonna save us
The only people that you find will betray us
They're gonna hate to hear the sound of my voice
When we're screaming their name, when we're screaming their name

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta burn it down
You gotta blow it up
You gotta give it hell
You gotta pull the plug
And you could run away
Or you could kill the beast
And you could try to kill yourself
But you could never kill me

[Chorus]
Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can burn it again
'Cause we will not go quietly
Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can tell all your friends
That we will not go quietly
(Not go quietly)

[Bridge]
Oh, we will not go quietly
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta burn it down
You gotta blow it up
You gotta give it hell
You gotta pull the plug
And you could run away
Or you could kill the beast
And you could try to kill yourself
But you could never kill me

Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can burn it again
'Cause we will not go quietly
Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can tell all your friends
That we will not go quietly

Hey, if this is how the world will end
You can tell all your friends
That we will not go quietly
Hey, if this is how the world will end
You can burn it again

In my trap house, man
I got this, y'all

[Chorus: Roy Jones Jr., Mr. Magic & Trouble]
Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked
Can't be shook, we hot
When will you niggas learn?
Came to get crunked, came to bring life
Came to get it started, came to get right
Turn down the music, turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn?

[Verse 1: Mr. Magic]
I mean what I speak, I do as I say
I hustle, I grind, don't get in my way
I'm pimping my hoes, I'm checking my foes
As I spit at police and duck my P.O.'s
I ain't going to court, you can call a judge
Tell him kiss my ass 'cause I ain't gon' budge
And I ain't going back to lock up
You try and the Glock'll pop up
I ain't going back to broke
And I'm never gon' stop the puffing
Not for nothing
The block, they need me
The streets, they need me
The club scene, nigga
Is mine, believe me
You don't believe me?

[Chorus: Roy Jones Jr., Mr. Magic & Trouble]
Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked

Turn down the music, turn up my mic

[Verse 2: Trouble]
Open your hearts for me, look what I got for you
You in the presence of greatness, I'll make it hot for you
Pass the rock to me, block and I'll run with it
Here for the game and all the pussy that come with it
So full of focus, I'm insistent on keeping it going
The Franchise, I exist in a league of my own
Expect attention unfamiliar with being ignored
The truth back, came in, locking and closing the door
Brick wall in the road, I won't move
The king, I'm like Roy in the ring, I can't lose
Show your face, it won't compare to mine
You want a war?
Motherfucker, I ain't hard to find
Now holla back, nigga

[Chorus: Roy Jones Jr., Mr. Magic & Trouble]
Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked
Can't be shook, we hot

Came to get it started, came to get right
Turn down the music, turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn?

[Verse 3: Roy Jones Jr.]
I move when my heart say move
Fierce like a lion, got nothing to prove
Stubborn as a hot damn mule
God in my corner, nigga can't lose
Trying to take me out my hot damn shoes
See how quick I jump up and give you bitches the blues
They gon' see you on the hot damn news
And I ain’t leaving nothin linking me to the crime
Not a print, not a hot damn clue
Beating these niggas down is what I came to do
And I ain't playing by a hot damn rule
Shaking you niggas down if you ain't paying your dues
We passing up yo block and ooh
My screws are loose
Don't call my hands 'cause you gon' make me act a hot damn fool
Dead discussion, you will not win 'cause I will not lose

[Chorus: Roy Jones Jr., Mr. Magic & Trouble]
Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked
Can't be shook, we hot
When will you niggas learn?
Came to get crunked, came to bring life
Came to get it started, came to get right
Turn down the music, turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn?

13253,The Violence,Rise Against,"[Verse 1]
Dancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or was it all a dream?

The bombs are getting closer everyday
""That can never happen here"" we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or was it all a dream?

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough or is it all a dream?

[Verse 2]
To a predetermined fate, are we condemned?
Or maybe we're a book without an end?
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control
And this is not a dream

So can we break this mold?
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away!

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough?

[Bridge]
Well trodden paths are all we take
We need a storm; let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from the shadows
And into the light

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Are we not good, good enough?
Or was it all a dream...

Come crashing to the floor
And I know there must be more like me
I've seen this all before, I can't carry this anymore

So breathe, let's leave, until the storm is over
Because I want to take you away

Move, and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do
And move, when you just can't take it

Move, and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do

I'm a fighter, a soldier
Turn my desire into gold

[Verse 2]
Now I'm staring down the barrel of a gun
Take my shot while I'm young
I can taste it on the tip of my tongue
You know I eat it, breath it, and I believe it
And when I lay my head down I even dream it
I taught my mind how to push through the pain
Can't stop, no way
This shit is in my DNA
False prophets preach that I'm not good enough
They try and knock me down, but I get right back up

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a gladiator, a warrior
I am fearless to the bone
I'm a fighter, a soldier
Turn my desire into gold
Turn my desire into gold

[Bridge]
I find strength, I dig deeper
I dig deeper, I'm a believer
I find strength, I dig deeper
I dig deeper, I'm a believer

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a gladiator, a warrior
I am fearless to the bone
I'm a fighter, a soldier
Turn my desire into gold
'Cause I'm a gladiator, a warrior
I am fearless to the bone
I'm a fighter, a soldier
Turn my desire into gold
'Cause I'm a gladiator, a warrior
I am fearless to the bone
Turn my desire into gold
Desire into gold

13335,Who Are You,The Who,"[Chorus: Pete Townshend & John Entwistle]
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?

[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said, “You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away”
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

[Chorus: The Who]
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back, and I hiccuped and looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way

[Chorus: The Who]
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on, tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

[Bridge: Townshend & Entwistle]
Who are you?
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa, ooh wa ooh

[Chorus: The Who]
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who  are you?
Who, who, who, who?
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on, tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

[Outro: The Who]
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me whoa are you (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me, tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on, come on, who? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, tell me who are you (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really wanna know
Oh, I really wanna know
Come on, tell me, who are you, you, you, you?
Who are you?

13332,EYE OF THE TIGER,Survivor,"[Verse 1]
Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

[Verse 2]
Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds till we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

[Verse 3]
Risin' up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye
Of the tiger

The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger

13342,The Trooper,Iron Maiden,"[Verse 1]
You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there, gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

This is ""Under Pressure""

[Applause]

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da
That's okay

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
High, Higher, High

[Bridge]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why?
Why?
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

13309,Heads Will Roll,Teamheadkick,"[Verse 1]
Step into the Battlefield, ready for war
I'm comin' ready to kill because I've been here before
Fill your face up, with the front of my shottie
That's what you get for talkin' shit when we sat in the lobby, bitch
All I hear is crying little squeakers
First I'll wreck your ass, then turn down the speakers
Face down in the mud, dialing the zoom
I pull the trigger (blah), send your head to the moon
It's you and me, and there's no one around
You wanna One V One me, come and get some, you're going down
Never making a sound (shh), we walk without noise
Noobs are getting rekt by all of my boys
Steady grabbin' ammo, staying low, being camo
I'm so gangster with the guns, it's like I'm Tony Soprano

[Chorus]
I stay low on the Battlefield, when your team walks by, you're getting killed
Now it's time to say goodbye
Heads will roll on the Battlefield, won't quit, won't stop, we never yield
Here we come, you're going to die

[Verse 2]
Battle of attrition, got the mission on my mind
Better watch your six, cause we're sneaking up behind
Take your whole crew out, with my team on my back
Every class, every weapon, everybody is stacked
On any map or location, anywhere you could run
I'm gonna get you in my sights, take the shot and you're done
Tossing out the nades, while you try to avoid
But as we infiltrate your base, you're getting destroyed
You're out of luck, your KDR sucks
Put the RPG in front of me, and hit you like a truck
Steady aimin' as I'm flankin', then I'm pullin' out the pistol
And they never see me comin' till I hit em like a missile
Steady droppin' noobs, and heavyweights too
When the SMG's are hummin' better watch your back, dude

[Chorus]
I stay low on the Battlefield, when your team walks by, you're getting killed
Now it's time to say goodbye
Heads will roll on the Battlefield, won't quit, won't stop, we never yield
Here we come, you're going to die

[Verse 3]
I need some help, cause I'm getting surrounded
It's like I'm in jail, cause my ass is getting pounded
I make the call, as I duck and I hide
And when my crew shows up, everyone of you dies
Everyone that I know is an FPS beast
Everyone understands that teamwork is key
Everyone looks out for the bros on the team
Everyone on my crew only knows victory

[Bridge]
Hardline, let's go, on the Battlefield it's time to roll
Put your guns up, get sum, rest in peace, cause now you're done
Hardline, let's go, on the Battlefield it's time to roll
Put your guns up, get sum, rest in peace, cause now you're done

[Chorus]
I stay low on the Battlefield, when your team walks by, you're getting killed
Now it's time to say goodbye
Heads will roll on the Battlefield, won't quit, won't stop, we never yield
Here we come, you're going to die

13321,Chaos And Earthquakes,Nonpoint,"[Verse 1]
Black operations usin' money colored black
Dark webs gettin' spun, so politically correct
Watchin' everybody fight each other
Sister versus brother
Peace versus war
Rich against the poor
Different versus different
Bed versus the floor
Wall versus the door
Shore black, water black, money black
Money-backin' greed back in season
Spring fall in summertime for unnatural reasons

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Wanna decide which side? You're a goner
Don't know which evil side is upon us this time
Mind your business. Stay in line
Find your calling. Enterprise

Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

[Verse 2]
This is maniacal, entire societies are fallin'
Without a net underneath ‘em and no one digging ‘em out
The fire has gotten out of control
We got no water, no buckets, and we’re lucky if tomorrow comes
""Why"" isn't important anymore
Sure, I'd like to know that need-to-know information
But when I know it
What reactions will it cause
When they finally show up dressed up, amped up in a black car?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wanna decide which side? You're a goner
Don't know which evil side is upon us this time
Mind your business. Stay in line
Find your glory, enterprise

13310,Turn It Up,Sonic Syndicate,"[Intro]
Turning up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
What the fuck you gonna do?
(Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do...)

[Verse 1]
Your body's swaying from side to side
I want to catch you when you fall
But then you'll have learnt nothing at all
Still, I'm ready to run
But you're so damn drunk
An atomic bomb couldn't wake you up

What's that you hear?
Bass and lights from the club?
I don't think so; I'm by your side
And all I hear is ambulance siren cries
Screaming, ""Help me
Help me, help me, help me""

[Pre-Chorus]
But the way that you looked

[Chorus]
Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
What the fuck you gonna do?
Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken nails and a bleeding soul
Suck it up, you fuckin' ho!

[Post-Chorus]
The way she walks, the way she talks
We all know the girl is halfway dead, dead, dead

[Verse 2]
You're selling your soul for whiskey and Coke
And you're a suicide for tequila and lime
And I got to admit
When I first saw you hit the dance floor
With your grind
You sent me out of my mind

But after watching you crawl
In the door at 5:00 AM
It's getting old
Out of soul, out of dough, out of all
But you're screaming, ""I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care! I don't care!""

[Pre-Chorus]
But the way that she looked

[Chorus]
Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
What the fuck you gonna do?
Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken nails and a bleeding soul
Suck it up, you fuckin' ho!

Turn it up like you always do
(The way she walks, the way she talks)
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
(We all know the girl is halfway dead)
What the fuck you gonna do?
Turn it up like you always do

Broken nails and a bleeding soul

Not seen you lately, I'm wondering on
White roses, caskets, your name on a stone
Turning up like you always do

Your feeling your fears and doubts come down on you
When it rains, it pours
In over your head to know where you're headed to

[Refrain 1]
I was stuck on windin' roads
No dead end signs, nowhere to go
Hopin' someone catch me if I fall

Can't seem to wanna show my face to
Anything or anyone at all

Goliath the ground with just one stone
And tell me there is a lifeboat

I'll be able to help you be brave

13312,Beating Heart,Steal The City,"It's time to turn this around
Once turned my life upside down
Now it's burning through my conscience
Sleepless nights come back around
Selfish thoughts in my mind, selfless actions are my downfall

I cannot waste my precious time
How many times can I cross the line?
Won't confess rain or shine
Such a mess but I'll be fine
After everything you put me through..

Give it up, give it up
It is my time to fight
It is my human right
To make sure I don't fade away
Money isn't everything it claims to be
I just wanna be free
From everything that's bringing me down

I'm not losing my mind
I thought it was over
But god only knows i was wrong
Seen better days time goes to show
I'm not waiting around
But you know it won't be long

I cannot waste my precious time
It is my time to let it shine
Not afraid to protest
I'll be at my best
Such a shame I'm still hung up on you

Give it up, give it up
It is my time to fight
It is my human right
To make sure I don't fade away
Money isn't everything it claims to be
I just wanna be free
From everything that's bringing me down

I didn't know that this day would be the end of me
I didn't know that the pain would feel so sharp
You wouldn't know if I ever made it this far
Still goes to show I still have a beating heart

Give it up, give it up
It is my time to fight
It is my human right
To make sure I don't fade away
Money isn't everything it claims to be
I just wanna be free
From everything that's bringing me down

Cannot clear my head
This time will be the last
There's nothing left to give

I can see your light
As I make my way to the edge
I'll put these chains behind me
And finally walk again

I tried to warn you
But my faithfulness is drowning
The only good's that left is fading from my memory

I'll put these chains behind me
And finally walk again

I can see your light

I have left this misery
You will pay for everything you fucking did to me
This will be the last time I put up with your shit
Nothing changes
Scream all you want
There's no more you can do to me

Everybody got the same swag now, watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top, all the way 'til my bands fallin' off
Every time that you leave your spot, your girlfriend call me like, ""Come on over""
I like the way that she treat me, gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain and I can't feel it, I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said ""I am not afraid to die""
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
All these haters wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em
Medicine, little bitch take some
Fast car, Nascar, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would become
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G, though
Lookin' at you stackin’ all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say, ""You're the worst; you're the worst""
I cannot die because this my universe

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""I am not afraid to die""
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Outro]
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

13315,One Reason,AmaLee,"[Verse 1: AmaLee]
Slit the throat of reason and reality
Cut myself and scream for their insanity
Wake up to this nightmare that will never end
The main attraction of this twisted master plan

[Verse 2: AmaLee]
Trust nothing but pain to get me through the days
Sleep with one eye open, not to be their prey
Fist against my face, they bring me to my knees
Pressure's crushing down so hard, I can't break free

[Pre-Chorus: AmaLee]
When I can feel my skin crawl, when I'm about to crack
The hunger for revenge gives me strength to stand

[Chorus: AmaLee & BrokeN]
I will be your deadman, with nothing but this blood on my hands
Stuck in your ""wonderland,"" I just want to make you bleed like me

[Verse 3: AmaLee]
Everyday goes by without a second thought
Living in a perfect and controlled project
A puppet of their sick perversion's appetite
Will I be trapped inside this hell until I die?

[Pre-Chorus: AmaLee]
So what if no one cares enough to make a change?
I give my bleeding heart out for one reason

[Chorus: AmaLee & BrokeN]
I will be your deadman, with nothing but this blood on my hands
Stuck in your ""wonderland,"" I want to make you bleed just like me
So make me your deadman, with only poison in my veins
Stuck in your ""wonderland,"" stagnated by the passivity
I'm gonna make you bleed like me

Suffocate everything
They complicate everything
They seal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
Take yourself far away from nothingness
A million miles from emptiness

Suffocate everything
They complicate everything
They seal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
Take yourself far away from nothingness
A million miles from emptiness

Remember the days of the innocence
Before it came in waves
Remember the trust it was blown away
Into oblivion
Remember love
Remember hate
Remember everything they said just to break you again
Remember all all of your enemies
Forever and ever they

Suffocate everything
They complicate everything
They seal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
Take yourself far away from nothingness
A million miles from emptiness

And the endlessness of all of our mistakes
Forget all the blame
And the apathy
And throw it all away
Forget the pain
Forget the hate
Forget all your enemies
They never will break you again

Suffocate everything
They complicate everything
They seal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
Take yourself far away from nothingness
A million miles from emptiness
And leave it all behind you

Suffocate everything
They complicate everything
They seal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
Take yourself far away from nothingness
A million miles from emptiness

Suffocate everything
They complicate everything
They seal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
Take yourself far away from nothingness
A million miles from emptiness
And leave it all behind you
Leave it all behind you
Leave it all behind you
Leave it all behind you

13313,Let It Slide,Freedumb,"I'm gonna let it slide, I'm gonna let it flow
I'm not gonna worry anymore
I'm gon' kick this rock on down the road
I'm not gonna carry no heavy load

I was brought up on the Bible
Fear of God and the devil too
By whiskey drinkers, heavy smokers
""Do as I say, child, not as I do""

We were gypsies born from gambling
""Pack your bag or pay the rent""
So we blew 'round, around that whole town
Like feathers in the wind

And we'll let it slide, gonna let it flow
I'm not gonna worry anymore
I'm gon' kick this rock on down the road
I'm not gonna carry no heavy load

There was trouble, there was heartbreak
Things a child could not control
When the feeling as it first wake
Wasn't aching in your soul

I have parted the curtains
Let the sun come streaming
Shift the rain from my hair
I have carried a burden
And no one can see it
And it's time to leave it there

Every evening I go riding
In my yellow pick-up truck
For the freedom and the night will
Turn my sorrow into luck

I'm gonna let it slide, I'm gonna let it flow
I'm not gonna worry anymore
I'm gon' kick this rock on down the road
I'm not gonna carry no heavy load

I've done everything as you say
I've followed your rules without question
I thought it would help me see things clearly
But instead of helping me to see
I look around and it's like I'm blinded

I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

Who do I turn to? And what do I do?
I'm looking for answers, the lies and the truth
I thought I knew better, but I don't know shit
It's gotta be out there, something better than this

[Chorus]
I'm caught in the middle of life
Somewhere in the middle of love
Nothing's gonna change till I break these chains
And I tear down the wall
I’m lost in the middle of life
Stuck in the middle of love
Nothing’s gonna change til I break these chains
And I tear down the wall

What is the meaning and where does it end?
What does it matter until it begins?
I can't go backwards, I can't give in
Feels like the future is dying and the past is dead

I'm caught in the middle of life
Somewhere in the middle of love
Nothing's gonna change till I break these chains
And I tear down the wall
I’m lost in the middle of life
Stuck in the middle of love
Nothing’s gonna change til I break these chains
And I tear down the wall

I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock 'n' roll
Sometimes, it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough
I keep saying that it's getting too much
But I know I'm a liar
Feeling alright in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire

Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you

Walking out on another stage
Another town, another place
Sometimes, I don't feel right
Nerves wound up too damn tight

Don't you tell me
That it's bad for my health
'Cause kicking back don't make it
Out of control, I play the ultimate role
Don't know how to fake it

Every time I'm with it alone
It picks me up
You just send me down
I can feel it rushing under my skin
You're a cage won't you let me in?
On my toes
Lock the door
Pretty face
Through the walls
Don't know if I'd be so sure again

[Chorus]
My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out

[Verse 2]
Every time I'm stuck in the ground
Spin me round, won't you spin me round
You're a void, a crack in the mirror
See me now, if you could see me now
You slipped through
The night
Then walked out
Skin tight
But you don't matter that much to me
No you don't matter that much to me

[Chorus]
My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out
So turn the lights out
Just turn the lights out

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out

All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die

Breaking the law, breaking the law

Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

I hitched a ride until the coast
To leave behind all of my ghosts
Searching for something I couldn't find at home

Can't get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit and I'll be fine
I swear to God, this'll be my one last time

Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down

When it gets dark in Pigeon Park
Voice in my head will soon be fed
By the vultures, that circle round the dead

Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down

I'd ever be caught
Staring at sidewalks
Hiding my track marks
I left my best friends
Or did they just leave me?

Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

13317,Venom,Eminem,"[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—

[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

To fifty million fables

They call me the seeker

But he couldn't help me either

Focusing on nowhere, investigating miles
I'm a seeker, I'm a really desperate man

I won't get to get what I'm after

I'm happy when life's good, and when it's bad, I cry
I got values, but I don't know how or why

I'm looking for me
You're looking for you
We're looking at each other
And we don't know what to do

They call me the seeker

13341,The Number Of The Beast,Iron Maiden,"[Intro: Barry Clayton]
Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty-six

[Verse 1]
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cos in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Night was black, was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?

[Chorus]
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

[Verse 3]
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

[Chorus]
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes

[Chorus]
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Six-six-six, the one for you and me

[Outro]
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside
If the pain goes on… A-a-a-ah!

[Verse 1]
I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create

[Verse 2]
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take

I spoke to the devil today
And he swears he's not to blame
And I understood

And the righteous side
The righteous side of Hell

As I take your hand
And lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies

Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers
Of a good friend
To the heart and mind

There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find!

I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way

We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay!

Oh, dear Mother, I love you
I'm sorry I wasn't good enough
Dear Father, forgive me
'Cause in your eyes, I just never added up

In my heart, I know I failed you
But you left me here alone

This is wartime, this is our time
We won't be denied
Feed the fire that is raging inside
This is go time, this is showtime

Let the madness fly
Show them strength that just can't be defied
Find the power to devour
Let the beast inside now be woken

In this world, only the strong will survive
Hear the roar and you will know you're alive
Feel the energy build in your soul

Raw emotion, pure devotion
They will testify
And our memory will endure for all time
Never hiding, no dividing

Take it higher, our desire
Will determine what we become now

13374,Battle Born,Five Finger Death Punch,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, I swore I had a heart
Long before the world I know tore it all apart
Once upon a time, there was a part of me I shared
Years before they took away the part of me that cared

[Chorus]
Been a thousand places
And shook a million hands
I don't know where I'm going
But I know just where I've been
I've flown a million miles
And I've rode so many more
Every day, a castaway, a vagabond
Battle born

[Post-Chorus]
I'm battle born

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time, I had an open point of view
But that was just so long ago before I had a clue
Was there such a time where I didn't stand alone?
Was there ever a time, and how would I have known?

Been a thousand places
And shook a million hands
I don't know where I'm going
But I know just where I've been

Sold into slavery down in New Orleans
Goddess of the bayou light
Black dog's head on the killing bed
Severed and left to bleed
There on fire in the corner of the world
There in misery
There on fire in the corner of the world
Left for God to see

Do you want to cross that line?
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me

13377,The Vengeful One,Disturbed,"[Verse 1]
He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation, I cannot forget

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

[Verse 2]
As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

[Pre-Chorus]
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

[Bridge]
When you die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die, you'll know why
You'll die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die, you'll know why

[Chorus]
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?

But I never get it right
No, I never get it right

[Chorus]
I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can't understand why they're stinging me

So I'm cutting that branch off the cherry tree
Singing, ""This will be my victory,""
Then I see them coming after me
And they're following me across the sea

And I don't know why this is happening
But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need

13396,Open Your Eyes,Disturbed,"[Verse 1]
You're paralyzed, breathe your disguise
You feed on the lies that they tell you
Got to break away from the numbing pain
Succumb to the rage that's inside you

You're hypnotized (Hypnotized), demoralized
Believe every line that they sell you
Start channeling (Channeling), whatever will remains
Discern from what's fiction and what is true

Open your eyes
(Whoa-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Whoa-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
See-through the disguise won't you open your eyes?

(Hey! Hey!)

[Verse 2]
You've lost your sense from the emptiness
You do as the headlines compel you
Become whole again and let the war begin
Destroy the veneer that surrounds you

There's no defense (No defense) for your recklessness
You stare as the proof lies before you
Why can't you see (Can't you see)
Are you afraid to be exposed to the demons around you?

Open your eyes

Open your eyes

Open your eyes
See-through the disguise won't you open your eyes?

You would all be running in a world you cannot hide
And the end is coming for the lemmings standing in line
Overcome it, let the fury build inside
It could all be broken if you only opened your eyes

Open your eyes
(Whoa-oh-oh, hey!)
Open your eyes
(Whoa-oh-oh, hey!)
Open your eyes

Here's to bein' human
All the pain and sufferin'
There's beauty in the bleedin'
At least you feel somethin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew what it was like
To care enough to carry on
I wish I knew what it was like
To find a place where I belong

Find a place where I belong

Undo these chains, my friend
I'll show you the rage I've hidden
Perish the sacrament
Swallow, but nothing's forgiven

You and I can't decide
Which of us was taken for granted
Make amends

You're not what you seem

Step inside, see the Devil in I

Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation, depravation
You should've burned when you turned on everyone

So, step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

So, step inside
Step inside
See the Devil in I
See the Devil in I

We're in the fight of our lives
And we're not ready to die!
Who's gonna fight for the weak, who's gonna make 'em believe?
I've got a hero
I've got a hero!
Livin' in me!
I've gotta fight for what's right, today I'm speakin' my mind
And if it kills me tonight
I will be ready to die!
A hero's not afraid to give his life
A hero's gonna save me just in time!

[Chorus: John Cooper, Jen Ledger & Both]
I need a hero to save me now!
I need a hero!
To save me now!
I need a hero to save my life!
A hero will save me 
Just in time!
I need a hero!

I need a hero!
A hero's gonna save me just in time!

S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it, let's go!

[Verse 1]
I've had enough
There's a voice in my head, says I'm better off dead
But if I sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, I'll be alright
You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, you'll be just fine, 'cause…

[Chorus]
Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it

We are possessed
We're all fucked in the head, alone and depressed
But if we sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, maybe we'll forget, 'cause…

[Chorus]
Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles
Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

[Breakdown]
The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's all sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay (Let's go)
So let's sing along
Let's sing along
A little fucking louder
A little fucking louder
Well, don't you feel so much better?

13383,Coming Undone,Korn,"[Verse 1]
Keep holding on
When my brain's ticking like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts
Have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along, mockingbird
You don't affect me

[Refrain]
That's right
Deliver it to my heart
Please strike
Be deliberate (Deliberate)

[Chorus]
Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

[Verse 2]
Choke, choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Pity me in the end
They're out to get me
Since I was young
I've tasted sorrow on my tongue
And the sweet sugar gun
Does not protect me

That's right
Trigger between my eyes
Please strike
Make it quick now (Now)

[Chorus]
Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

[Bridge]
I'm trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better

[Chorus]
Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me

I can't always say
""It's gonna be better tomorrow""

That you can't just live your motherfuckin' life?
The story's gettin' old and my heart is gettin' colder

You got rocks in your head, I can hear them rollin' 'round

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention

The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope
And we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

Ah, ah, ah, aw

You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless

That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope

Why do they always send the poor?

Victorious Victorias kneel for brand-new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth

Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions

13352,Ziggy Stardust,David Bowie,"[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders From Mars
He played it left hand, but made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man, well-hung and snow-white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass, he was the nazz
With God-given ass, he took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Ooh

Ziggy played guitar

Choose strife

Cause i've never asked for this (Asked For This)
Too many times I’ve prayed for something i could never change
We can't hide
And from the same old life i live
Too many times I’ve tried but you seem to be still the same

Entrapment holds us all, you’re a prisoner
We crave false approval
The ones who left us behind
The ones who fear the storm
Are the ones who can't take this anymore
When the lights go out
And the truth is told
We won't be feared by the thought of the darkest hole
Trapped in the system
With no hope left
Can we ever break these chains

Can we ever break these chains
We won't be feared by the thought of the darkest hole
I hope this new path will see a future

But just like them all you've shown your true colors
And here I am again alone in the dark
I feel so lost in myself

Controlled with no feeling
We want to escape
They surrounded our sins

I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today

It's time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to die

Taking all I can take
It's time to say goodbye
It's a good day to die

And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know
It's time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to die

And I know all I know
It's time I said goodbye today
With all I know
It's time I said goodbye

13440,Devil’s Den 鬼,October Ends,"We build this city on our own
So if we destroy it, we decide
Now i don't need the city that never cared for me
Neither you, i’ve made my mind

The devil you know is better (than) the angels you don't
Calling yourself clean you not, no one can see who you are
Is that all you got? Is that all you got?

The devil you know is better (than) the angels you don't
Calling yourself clean you not, no one can see who you are
Is that all you got? Is  that all you got?

Hiding, hiding behind a mask
Take one, another look at yourself
You think, that you’re better than us
That you're better than us

That you're better than us

I've been waiting all this time
Out in the cold
I've been waiting for the moment
I'll shape my way
I've been feeling so destroyed after the fall
You're the reason
I’ve been going astray

You’re dead, stop living in a masquerade
Take a look at yourself
We are, we're all trapped in the den
We’re all trapped in the den

Bitch I fucking hate you
Like a sickness in my head
I can never pull through
Wake up, this city is dead fool
So fucking dreadful
I'm on my own

What's left of me
It's yours for your eyes to keep
Inside of me

Put your mind at ease 'cause you pay no rent
Just let me know when you're ready to unwind

I want to see you satisfied

Walk into the room like you need answers
When it don't matter what you think you'll find
Set your phone aside so we could get lost
In things that don't cost a penny of your time

Don't tell me that you're satisfied

And surrender
I walked the path that led me to the end
Remember
I'm caught beneath with nothing left to give, forever

When all is lost and daylight ends

And wash away the sky
The turning of the tide

I dig farther down this hole
That I have made
And I don't know

If each fist-full I take
Brings me closer to my goal or to a grave

To try to leave you behind

The black hole you left me in
Trying
To get you out of my mind
Before I bury myself alive

I am the prey
Swimming circles in a fishbowl on display
And I'm stuck here
Always in a
Struggle to breathe
Under an avalanche that won't stop falling

The black hole you left me in
Digging
To try to leave you behind
I'm in
The black hole you left me in

To get you out of my mind
Before I bury myself alive

Does this hole
Lead straight to hell?
'Cause I'm falling
And all I know
Is lost under

A black hole
You left me in
Digging
To try to leave you behind
I'm in
The black hole you left me in
Trying
To get you out of my mind

To try to leave you behind

To get you out of my mind

Head to higher ground while there's a chance to live

Well, if you told me you were drownin'
I would not lend a hand

The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot; I can show you the truth
And I don't need a reason to lie to you
No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
If you don't have a weapon, you can't have mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life... it feels like a prison

Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your prima donnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react; it's as simple as that
It's better just to settle than face the facts

I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life... it feels like a prison

You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

One thing that I can't stand
Is when the minutes fight the second hand
I'll waste a lifetime's worth
Just to cling to one more day

No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
Man is a four-letter word, it's really absurd
The hate isn't fake; it's just inferred

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
I'm down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
Oh, I'm not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

[Verse 1]
This has been a long time coming
Remember that I fucking loved you
When you said that I was nothing?
I kept your picture in my wallet
Showed you off to everyone
But little did I know the person you'd become

[Refrain]
All my friends had told me I should stay away
But I never paid attention to the words they would say
You're crying after lies, but I never gave up
Now I've paid for my mistakes
My momma told me you were bad for me
You were a disasterpiece
Don't you remember Billie Jean?
She says that I am the one
(Hee-hee-hee, ooh-ooh)

You're a liar, you lied to me (To me)

I'm running outta words that rhyme (That rhyme)
I see you on the streets (The streets)
Do you feel incomplete? (Incomplete)
But I remember the time, you
When you told me

[Refrain]
You were going out with some friends
And that you'd be home by ten
""Don't worry about them other boys
Because they don't mean a thing""
I know you're not alone, so I hit your cell phone
But you won't pick up now, all I get is dial tone
I know you were with another guy, I can see it in your eyes
Your friends, they told me it just became my time to leave

[Bridge]
(Stay away)
You tried to take control of me
You never thought that I could leave
(It's too late, oh no)
I just don't see you the same
Do you consider how
You made me broken, bitter now?
Take your shit, leave me alone
This is no longer a home
You ruined me, this is what you do to me
Flowers for the dead
Say goodbye and turn my head
(You're a liar, you lied to me, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
You're a liar, you lied to me (To me)
You can try to deny it, but now I can see
You're a liar, you lied to me

'Cause you fucked it up after all (After all)
'Cause you fucked it up after all (Oh, oh no)
'Cause you fucked it up after all (After all)

To my mother, to my father
It's your son, or it's your daughter
Are my screams loud enough for
You to hear me? Should I turn this up for you?

I sit here, locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said

The silence is what kills me
I need someone here to help me
But you don't know how to listen
And let me make my decisions

Gets us nowhere way too fast

All your insults and your curses
Make me feel like I'm not a person
And I feel like I am nothing
But you made me, so do something!
'Cause I'm fucked up, because you all
Need attention, attention you couldn't give!

'Cause I sit here, locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
I sit here, locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said!
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

From cigarettes to skinny jeans
You got the money, they got the means

A lost generation trying to act profound

13415,Love Crime,My Darkest Days,"Some say that love is blind
Some lovers live in lie
She meant the world to me
I've found my one and only

Felt no guilt inside
Can't tell the wrong from right
She stole my soul from me
Her heart is cold and empty
(Turn around and run away)

Get out alive
Before she goes and makes another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)
I paid the price
So she could go and make another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)

Her smile, you can't resist
There's poison on her lips
Disguised as an angel
One night could be fatal

Next victim on her list
Gets caught with just one kiss
You'll never see it coming
To her, love is nothing

Get out alive
Before she goes and makes another victim of the love crime
(Of the love crime)
I paid the price
So she could go and make another victim of the love crime

Turn around and run away

Get out alive

And take the city up

Cold steel calls out my name
Tempted to give in to the rage
Torn apart by this affliction
Locked up inside myself
This life is much too young to fade

I ran away from the pain
Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This won’t be the end of me

Sells an empty promise
They build you up just to watch you fall
It’s time to meet this face to face

I ran away from the pain
Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This won’t be the end of me

Black and white melt into grey
Till every truth is stripped away
When nothing’s wrong nothing’s okay
Everyone has been betrayed

Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This won’t be the end of me

13408,Savior,Rise Against,"[Intro]
It kills me not to know this, but I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face, that this world has forgotten

[Verse 1]
There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!""

That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

[Verse 2]
And the day pressed on like crushing weights, for no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!""

For the questions that you still have!""
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...

The hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah)
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah)
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and (aah-aah-aah)
Oh, I cannot give any more

It's just that this
Is not the way I'm wired, so, could you please
Help me understand why
You've given in to all these
Reckless dark desires? You're

Lying to yourself again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, why would I wanna watch you?

Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your rush, now?
Everyone will have his day to die

Medicated, drama queen
Picture-perfect, numb belligerence
Narcissistic, drama queen
Craving fame and all its decadence

Lying through your teeth again, suicidal imbecile

If you choose to pull the trigger
Should your drama prove sincere
Do it somewhere far away from here

13461,Quid Pro Quo,Critic City,"I might have met my match
Stick with us and we just might light it up
You better bet your ass I’ma get this cash, I don’t need no Midas touch

I’m finna flick my ass, side of your fortress I be climbing. You better pick your path, the man gets stabbed so deep that the knife gets stuck

Switch who spits I think it’s Stitch like 626, it isn’t Doyle

I get it lit better change my coils

Kings like royals

Since we’re spoiled

Yup

Yup, yup

Spoiled with the ability to rap
I’ma stick a tac on a city on a map
Hit ‘em up and snap like a finisher attack

Tell me where they roll, I’ma hit where they at
So much money, gotta fit it in a bag
Matt like a poodle that’s sitting on my lap
She gon’ know the name when I hit it from the back

Going from a 1 to 10
No one even really gives a fuck who I am

That’s not true

I’ma just go again, grabbing a feat. like I’m under the bed, I’m a monster
Or one’s stuck in my head

I’ll take a shot, like a gun to defend
Nah, I’ll take a shot, never rush for the net
‘Cause I just don’t pretend I got money to spend

Just don’t pretend ‘cause your money could
I’m taking out all of your company friends
You takin’ a look and I’m crushing the lens
This shit is bukkake, I’ll come for your head

I’m deadin’ them all but I opened the door
Fly lines, somebody pull my chord

Hey, can I go once more?

Of course

You sure? I like yours but I’m getting kinda bored in the background

*gasp* man, stand down, I am the one that you called when you needed a handout, I’m not a fan now

Wait, I ain’t looking to be starting shit
No arguments
So let’s aim where the target is
The audience and all my partnerships
Started from a hand shake like Parkinson’s

Y’all swim with the largest fish
Rippin’ up your apartment quick
The carpet is covered up in carcasses
It’s hard to miss with mark with the sharpest pick

Wooh

Sick flow bro

Thanks, you too, yo the intro’s dope

Match up force with the back and forths
That I have endorsed like a quid pro quo

Wooh

What the kids don’t know

Is the kick’s so dope that the windows broke

And the crack of the snare leaves a crack in the mirror like a glass getting smashed when I hit those notes

Spitting in the kitchen cooking more than Gordon Ramsay
If it isn’t hitting then you salty or you have beef
Even out the seasons yo, I store em in the pantry
Maybe we can take it to recording on a rap beat

I ain’t really shocked ain’t nobody understand me
I could take the kitty from the bitty like a plan B
I be pullin’ up with the white like a banshee
They don’t really like it in life when you happy

Okay I’m hearing you rapping
Let’s hear some lyrics with passion
I’m always scared of collapsing
Always so jealous of people who mention that their biggest fear is arachnids

‘Cause I’m a Spider-Man but hyper than anyone that try the gang get sniped, they can hit you from a mile away, your life could end
You ain’t really gonna see the lights again

Okay I’ma pick it up and quicken up da pace
Like I’m whipping in a civic and I’m here to win a race
Might leave a bitter taste
I’m fresher than the ice that’s sitting in a little sip of lemonade
I’ve seen some better days
I’ve been a renegade
I’ve spoken for the people who don’t ever get a say
If I’m sitting on a plane
Getting paid to entertain
Then I did it all just being me, anyways

They gonna claim they on the radio but they don’t want to play the song
Who would’ve thought it would take this long?
Fire on the piggy like filet minion
Left as a youth and I came and gone
Hit me up quick, yo we can’t be long
Don’t be coming ‘round where you ain’t be long
They gon’ sing it loud on the day we gone
So what?

But you know what?
They’ll explode when they know I'ma blow up
Take some notes so I don’t have to show ya
They want smoke, just roll up the doja

Wooh

Roll up the doja
I pull it out like a cobra
Taking a bite and it’s over
I put the kid in a coma
I do not need no exposure
I just would like a diploma
School of hard knocks and I’m rightfully owner
I am the life of the party, I’m getting retarded, I follow this Molly and soda
On my sorority shit

I’m sorry my friend
It’s about time, we’re departing again
Pardon the arson and sparks with the pen
It’s just we’re going hard from the start to the end. Ahh!

God damn. Let’s see mawfucka try to do that

Geeze! Geeze!

There's a bloody needle skipping on a record
There's a stray dog sniffing at the rug
There's a lipstick Venus in the bathroom mirror
But she hasn't got time for love
I got the neighbors screaming in my bedroom
And I'm afraid to open the door
There's a crooked white cross in my baby's heart
It's got her going back for more

There she goes again
She's high again
She's tripping with her friends
Without a care
She's high again
She's lonely without me

All the creaturеs, they are running from the moonlight
Scattеring like mischief in the street
There's a cold wind blowing from the end of the world
It smells like addiction and defeat
All the angels have hidden in the basement
Where my love is tearing at the seams
She sold my soul to the shadows below
Now they're feeding on the fear inside my dreams

There she goes again
She's high again
She's tripping with her friends
Without a care
She's high again
She's lonely without me

But you're broken, it's all right
I thought that you were divine

13456,Empires,Coastlines,"So many look yet so few truly see
So many humans, but no humanity
All of them someone
But never themselves
They're smiling and laughing
But going through hells

They mask what they're feeling
""Show none of the bad""
Theres no shame in crying
In showing you're sad

I feel no shame in crying
In showing I'm sad
No shame in crying
In showing I'm sad

Fake a smile re-assure
They must never know
Fake a smile readjust
Win their trust, win their trust

Its falling your empire in dust
Ashes, an empire in flames
See thе fire and the brimstone
See the mask melted down
Hear the truth remove the blindfold
Embold it on a tombstone

Feel the rush, feel adored
An even score

Followed by sheep
(I've tried to ignore)
You pretend to be deep
(I've tried to forget)
Feasting on diffidence

You make me sick

So many humans but no humanity
So many look yet so few truly see
So many humans but no humanity
So many look yet so few truly

Humanity!

It's falling your empire in dust
Ashes, an empire in flames

An empire in flames

That cannot be ignored
Just follow in my voice
Catch out in a lie
Just break down
It's not that I don't look down on you
But it's not just you, I'm also blame
There was nothing more that we can do
Let's just do what we can for now
Find a way to prevеnt me from being hurt evеn if I writhe in pain
You don't know everything, I see a dream
With my eyes open while lay in my bed, it's like nightmare

13493,Suicide,Bad Apples,"I sit on my front porch and light a cigarette in the middle of the evening
There’s a thickness in the atmosphere around me

As I tilt my head back against the fortress of my home, all I can do is remember and wish these walls were painted blue

I hold my troubles in my lungs and release their smoldered vapors to be free amongst the sunset

I am personified in my own head as a better man than I’ve ever been
And I want to be remembered as such

This is classic “He picked the bad apple in the bunch” support system
I’ll fetch the tinder. We’ll smoke his witchcraft alive and send his ashes into the abyss

You’re a horrible mess
And I’m as horrible, yes

Echolocation when you’ve lost sight of your light
It’s on some Super Moon shit

Tonight, we let the devils play advocate to my impressive bedrock foundation
Send signals straight from the nucleus

He is the center of all your problems
He is the answer to the qualms you haven’t solved yet
She’s the sweat that nervousness and psalms bred
She’s the lines betwixt your palms read

I pulled the bears out of the cottage
They were determined junkie-enablers who set their sights on the universe’s final mystery

What is it about the end of times that lets the hopeless live life contently?
Suddenly the final clue is found and all that’s left of curiosity is (You were right and I was wrong) like trying to convince the wrong date to a groundhog

Set Nibelheim to flames and call the man with one wing a bastard of divinity

Do you really want to know who you are?
Can you handle diving deep in your own heart?
Learn about yourself before your good luck turns tits up
Bottom of the well with your rope cut

Now tell me exactly how you plan to get us outta this one?

Make your mood malleable
The wrong guy will fuck you in the streets
The Good Guys and The Bad Guys take turns guessing how long until you fall to your knees

Sugar-Skull Kid lost the paint on his face to the rain
Exposed his pain to those who prefer not to care if it’s wet all year
I was raised to be indifferent to the thunder
Originate the platform
(Master of peasants)
Cut and conform just like your father did
(But when your life is so damn great I wonder if your father did it for you)
(Or Before you)
(I implore you)

Reconsider

2 shots of Jager later and you’ll be concrete-stuck like floor glue
And you won’t ever remember being brave this afternoon

It’s not worth seeing you free if you’re not free with me
I’d rather have you suffer in a place where I can help you
Especially since you won’t ask me too

It hurts me alot more than you do
I’m vibrant and colossal
You’re far too frail and vulnerable

I don’t pick up your calls at all
From my day job I could watch your final fall

Trapped in the life like a fucking disease

Your curse has shadowed a vision I can’t foresee

Condemned from the life that we once knew
Moving forward cause we fucking have to
Place your bets our lives won’t be the same
This is our rеsurrection

I want to give in this apathy
Every day I’m just waiting for thе night
Trying to pretend that everything is fine

But I can’t give up because of you
That’s not love it’s just my hate for you
Motivating me to wanna see you fail

When you can't escape the past
And you let go of what you have for someone else
You know the end is coming

There's no hope of a final chance
My head is battered from
All the thoughts that's keeping me silent
But is it this simple to just let it go?

I’m not jealous, I am your enemy
You took full advantage of them and of me
I had once given up on everything
I can’t keep this up
It’s time that I see the real me

I want to give in this apathy
Every day I’m just waiting for the night
Trying to pretend that everything is fine

But I can’t give up because of you
That’s not love it’s just my hate for you
Motivating me to wanna see you fail

There’s no more words for this fight
I know that we aren’t alive
This is the end of me and you, and you can not break me

Defeat this poison inside of me
You’re gonna break down these walls
The rest of time will not heal this

Directionless I am
The compass inside my head
Has left me lost again

I'll find my way

I finally felt alive

One breath that had set me free
A first step to be more than me
I found a place i could call my home
A new life to make my own

I managed to fix myself
With decency over wealth
I'd found a better way

I'm at the bottom, can you come let me up?
'Cause I wrote a vow for you
Your friends are faded, let me fill up your cup
And toast to the stars over

[Pre-Chorus]
The ocean's foaming
Emotions in the air

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew what it took to win
I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew we'd be more than friends

[Verse 2]
We spin the bottle till we're kissing our cups
Felt like I'd die for you
You can't explain it, it's been years since we've touched
And I've waited nine for you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew what it took to win
I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew we'd be more than friends

[Bridge]
Come let me up
Can you hear me now?
I'm 'bout half a block away out
Can you hear me now?

[Pre-Chorus]
The ocean's foaming
Emotions in the air

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew what it took to win
I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew we'd be more than friends

[Post-Chorus]
Come let me up, can you hear me now?
Come let me up, I'm 'bout half a block away out
Come let me up, can you hear me now?
Come let me up, I'm 'bout half a block away out
Come let me up

[Outro]
Can you hear me now, come let me up
I'm 'bout half a block away out, come let me up

13524,House Of The Rising Sun,Five Finger Death Punch,"[Intro]
There is a house in Sin City
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And, God, I know I'm one

[Verse 1]
My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in Sin City

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

[Verse 3]
Well, I've got one foot on the platform
The other's on the train
I'm goin' back to Sin City
To wear that ball and chain

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
Well, others, tell your children
Never do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
In the House of the Rising Sun

[Outro]
Well, there's a house in Sin City
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God knows that I, I'm one

13521,Shepherd of Fire,Avenged Sevenfold,"[Verse 1]
Let's take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See, I have pity in watchin' you suffer
I know the feeling of bein' damned alone
I've got a storybook of my own

[Chorus]
Don't you see I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
That I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire

[Verse 2]
Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell ya who not to be

Now you know I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
Pardon your mind from the chains of the divine
Make way, the Shepherd of Fire

[Bridge]
Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me, it's never too late

[Outro]
I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
That I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
I am your wrath, I am your guilt, I am your lust
(And you know it's right)
That I am your law, that I am your scar, I am your trust
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire

13519,Sail,DevilDriver,"[Verse 1]
This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my ADD baby, baby!
This is how an angel cries
I blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my ADD baby, baby!

13513,Hallelujah,Shim,"There’s a time to live and a time to die
Most of us don’t think twice
My little boy should’a checked your ego
There’s a time to speak and a time to lie
Most of us can’t decide
Do what you do to get what you need though
It’s a long way down
Can I get an Amen or an Hallelujah
If you’re lost or found
Can I get an Amen or an Hallelujah

There’s a time to scream and a time to cry
And if you don’t pick ‘em right
You’ll make a hot mess mess outta where you’re at now
There’s a time to sleep and a time to rise
But is it worth the fight?
You might be wrong or they might be what you say so
It’s a long way down
Can I get an Amen or an Hallelujah
If you’re lost or found
Can I get an Amen or an Hallelujah

Stuck in the life I designed
I can’t rewind
Going out of my mind
And if you feel me sing Hallelujah
If you feel me sing Hallelujah
If you feel me sing Hallelujah
If you feel me sing Hallelujah

All these lines in my face gettin' clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay

[Bridge]
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true
And all the feelings
Come back to you

Sing it with me

13522,With Me Now,Blacklite District,"[Verse 1]
Got no time for my game, I put it on the shelf
And this money and fame ain't gonna earn itself
I'm not wastin' my time, you better recognize
The flame, the hustle, the pain, the redness in my eyes
When the pressure comes down you throw the towel in
But for me and my crew, that's where the work begins
At the end of the day we like to cut it loose
By the end of the night we're making bodies move
We're waiting, we're waitin', we're waitin'

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the bright lights, high life, everybody's feelin' right
Live it up, keep it poppin' all night
We are ready for the throw down, showdown, never fuckin' slow down
Live it up, tonight it's gonna go down
You know we need it loud
Shout if you're with me now

[Verse 2]
I could be goin' off without any warning
From 6 p.m. to at least 6 in the mornin'
When the sun comes out, we keep it goin'
Looks like a two-day bout, that's what we're throwin'
We're rollin' out, what's up with you?
You know the place we're going to
We're doing shots at breakfast time
We smoke two joints and cut-in-line
We're waitin', we're waitin', we're waitin'

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the bright lights, high life, everybody's feelin' right
Live it up, keep it poppin' all night
We are ready for the throw down, showdown, never fuckin' slow down
Live it up, tonight it's gonna go down
You know we need it loud
Shout if you're with me now
If you're with me now

[Bridge]
You need it, I bleed it
Just take it if you want it
Don't waste it, just taste it now

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the bright lights, high life, everybody's feelin' right
Live it up, keep it poppin' all night
We are ready for the throw down, showdown, never fuckin' slow down
Live it up, tonight it's gonna go down
You know we need it loud
Shout if you're with me now
You know we need it loud
Shout if you're with me now

I love the way you dominate and you violate me
I love you for every time you gave up on me

I love you for never believing in what I say
I love you for never once giving me my way
I love you for never delivering me from pain
I love you for always driving me insane

13549,Rise Up,Saliva,"I wish couldn't go back to yesterday
When I learned the truth about love and hate
I figured out that life was just a game
But I play to win so tell me who's to blame?

We point the finger at you
So tell me what you think you're gonna do

Rise up. Come face to face
Rise up. Let's make a change
Tomorrow could be the end
Rise up. You better take a shot
Rise up. When it's all you got
Tomorrow could be the end
Rise up

And now when I go back to yesterday
So close but still I'm so far away
You know we all gotta learn from our mistakes
I can't die young, I won't fade away

It's time we choose a side
It's time for do or die
Somethings are worth the fight
It's time to set it off

Rise up. Come face to face
Rise up. Let's make a change
Tomorrow could be the end
Rise up. You better take a shot
Rise up. When it's all you got
Tomorrow could be the end

I wish couldn't go back to yesterday
I wish couldn't go back to yesterday

Rise up. Come face to face
Rise up. Let's make a change
Tomorrow could be the end
Rise up. You better take a shot
Rise up. When it's all you got
Tomorrow could be the end

Rise up

13540,No Surprise,Theory of a Deadman,"Friday is when you left me
So I'll drink myself to sleep
And Sunday is when I'll wake up
Not to remember a thing

My friends all say the same thing
I don't know my new girl too well
(I know)
That all this lying gets to me
And no one seems to give a shit
(The way)
She talks to every guy in the bar
(I guess)
It should've raised some kind of alarm
Who'd ever think I'd go in and end up
Like all the other guys that you've gone and fucked?!

Well it ain't no surprise
That you'd turn me on and leave
It ain't no surprise
That you'd turn it around on me
I don't know why
You won't give me what I need
It ain't no surprise
That that bitch is leavin' me

My friends are mean to me
They say I don't break up too well
(They know)
All this crying gets to me
And no one seems to give a shit
Well I know you want to
So go on and say it
Just go on and say it
Just go on and say it

Well it ain't no surprise
That you'd turn me on and leave
It ain't no surprise
That you'd turn it around on me
I don't know why
You won't give me what I need

There's no sense, the fire burns
When wisdom fails, it changes all
The wheel embodies all that keeps on turning
Blood red skies, I feel so cold
No innocence, we play our roll
The wheel embodies all, where are we going?

Though it's not paradise

13517,Lola Montez,Volbeat,"[Intro]
Feel the fire where she walks
Lola Montez so beautiful
Shady and a tempered dame
Blinding your eyes with her spider dance

[Verse 1]
Her performance utterly
Erotic subversive to all ideas
And for public morality
And cool as she was she didn't care
See the miner throw his gold
Lifting her skirt howling loud like a wolf
Hell raising and full of sin
When Lola was dancing and showing her skin

[Chorus 1]
Wherever she walks
She will be captivating all the men
Don't look in her eyes
You might fall and find the love of your life, heavenly
But she'll catch you in her web
The love of your life, yeah

[Verse 2]
Feel the fire where she walks
Lola Montez so beautiful
Shady and a tempered dame
Blinding your eyes with her spider dance
Well notorious I have been
But never for fame, that's what she said
Dear Henry taste my whip
Never to see any words you print

[Chorus 1]
Wherever she walks
She will be captivating all the men
Don't look in her eyes
You might fall and find the love of your life, heavenly
But she'll catch you in her web
The love of your life, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh Lola I'm sure that the love would have been
The key to all your pain
The key to all your pain
No words will later come
Did the spider bite your tongue
We will surely not forget
We will surely not forget
The Lola spider dance
Whoa!

[Outro]
Don't look in her eyes
You might fall and find the love of your life, heavenly
But she'll catch you in her web
The love of your life, yeah

13544,Die For You,Otherwise,"[Verse 1]
Can't kill the way I feel
Can't stop a hurt so real
Can't kill what I've denied
There's nothin' left to sacrifice
I stand on solid ground
Look up from falling down
There's nothin' left unsaid
I live with no regrets

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel so alive, I could die

[Chorus 1]
I would break, I would burn, I would suffer
There's nothin' I wouldn't do, do for you
I would lie, I would steal for no other
You make me feel so alive
So alive I'd die for you

[Verse 2]
There's nothin' left to hide
Want you to see inside
For me there is no doubt
My heart is yours, so rip it out
I don't expect you to understand this
I'll take what you give, but I won't take it for granted

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel so alive, I could die

Watch me light the sky
Light up the sky
Watch me light the sky
Light up the sky

[Verse 1]
Hands held high sweat dripping off me
Light it softly, got these fakers trying to stop me
This ain't a hobby it's a way of life
Just like Holyfield and Tyson, gloves on fight night
Boom here comes the hurricane monsoon
Switched up, came to redecorate the room
My ears are ringing from hearing the same sound
So what now all of the walls just came down

[Pre-Chorus]
I blaze a trail like the rays from tail lights
Sound shaking the ground like earthquakes hail might
Someday I'll die but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

[Chorus]
Light up the sky
Watch me light the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky

[Verse 2]
Game time ripping mint condition
Lights out stomping all competition
My upmost to it's highest it gets no flyer
Uh oh we set the mainframe on fire
Boom cold lead from the peddle I push to the metal
The dust never settles
F5 level kick up the bass in the tremble
Because faith that's rebel, I could show you the devil

[Pre-Chorus]
I blaze a trail like the rays from taillights
Sound shaking the ground like earthquakes and hail might
Someday I'll die but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

Watch me light the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky

Nowhere else have I seen such lions led by lambs
So if you're not afraid of us stand up and take my hand
We got a battle upfront but beyond that's the promise land
And when we all shout together then believe me they'll understand
Nowhere else have I seen such lions led by lambs
So if you're not afraid of us stand up and take my hand
We got a battle upfront but beyond that's the promise land
And when we all shout together then believe me they'll understand

I blaze a trail like the rays from taillights
Sound shaking the ground like earthquakes and hail might

Made myself this way
A pillar an unafraid
Don't drop the shade
You down with O-p-p-o-s-i-n-g?

Tastefully hating these
Thought police
Unbreakable no release

Hate me hate me

Until my dying day

Now common sense isn't common
Unconscious logic quick to the coffin
Stray from the path footsteps like this
On a soap box but you're all silent
I'm sick of the same story
So boring
If you try to ignore me this is your last warning
I don't fuck with the obvious
Up top while you're all in the audience

Hate me hate me

13529,The Unforgiven II,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you? Yeah
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Verse 2]
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...

13514,Numb,The Veer Union,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Every step that I take is another mistake to you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

The one thing you can’t live without
Yeah, I’m the girl you've been waiting for
I’ll have you down on your knees, I’ll have you begging for more
You probably thought I wouldn't get this far
You thought I’d end up in the back of a car
You probably thought that I’d never escape
I’d be a rat in a cage I'd be a slave to this place
You don’t know how hard I fought to survive, waking up alone when I was left to die
And you don’t know about this life I've lived, all these roads I've walked, all these tears I've bled

So how can this be, you’re praying to me
There’s a look in your eyes, I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything

I can be your whore!
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for

[Verse 2]
I’m the one that you need and fear
Now that you’re hooked, it’s all becoming clear
That all your judgments that you placed on me was a reflection of discovery
So maybe next time when you cast your stones
From the shadows of the dark unknown
You will crawl up from your hiding place
And take a look in the mirror, see the truth in your face

So how can this be, you’re praying to me
There’s a look in your eyes, I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything

[Pre-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
There's only one thing left here to say
""Love's never too late""

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & Chad Kroeger]
I've broken free from those memories
I've let it go, I've let it go
And two goodbyes led to this new life
Don't let me go, don't let me go

[Post-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Don't let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go

[Outro: Avril Lavigne]
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go

13545,Die For You,Red,"[Verse 1]
I know you hate me
I never meant to make you feel this way
I feel so betrayed
I never thought I could feel condemned
I never thought I could feel all your sin

[Chorus]
Oh! I can feel your madness now
Oh! I can feel your fire now
It's what I burn for
It's what I bleed for
I would die for you
You know I'd die for you

I feel exposed, I feel disgraced
I feel a whole new kind of hate
Someone please tell me
What I'm supposed to do
Cause you hate me but I love you

Oh! I can feel your fire now
It's what I burn for
It's what I ache for

Oh! I can feel your fire now
It's why I'm breaking down

13508,Unbreakable,Of Mice & Men,"[Verse 1]
There are weapons in the sound, and they echo all around
And you feel the bitter sting as you fall to the ground
Memories and plans forgone, pave the way for fear to spawn
To find a vein to feast upon, hoping I become undone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

[Chorus]
I'm unbreakable
Can't defeat me though I'm bleeding
Unbreakable
Though I'm bending, I'll never break
I'll never break

Throwing caution to the wind, learning how to fight again
I carry on regardless of the shape I'm in
Every torch and pitchfork thrown only makes the fire grow
When it engulfs you, you will know that I will not be overthrown

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

[Chorus]
I'm unbreakable
Can't defeat me though I'm bleeding
Unbreakable
Though I'm bending, I'll never break
I'll never break

Through the firestorm, I will remain
And you will know where you stand
Through the firestorm, I will remain
And you will know where you stand, go
Through the firestorm, I will remain
And you will know where you stand
And you will know where you stand

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

Can't defeat me, though I'm bleeding
Unbreakable
Though I'm bending, I'll never break
Unbreakable
Unbreakable

13546,Mystify,Saving Abel,"You know you mystify...

Consuming moments just like these
I'm being broken down on my knees
It's getting clear, what do I see?
I feel your love reaching out for me
Oh, mirror, it's so clear
That I'll run and disappear
So mirror, mirror on the wall:
Who's the biggest fool of all?

Yeah...
You know you mystify me
You bring a light to the life, I'm breathing
Yeah...
You know you mystify...
You bring a light to the life, I'm living

Why am I running from the past
With all the memories that couldn't last?
So when you peek into my soul
Why do I run, when you make me whole?
So mirror, mirror on the wall:
Who's the biggest fool of all?

With no light, no sight, no eyes I see
I can't help, I feel love reaching out for me

Yeah...

Yeah...
You know you mystify me
You bring a light to the life, I'm breathing
Yeah...
You know you mystify...
You bring a light to the life, I'm living

Yeah...
You know you mystify...

13536,What If I Was Nothing,All That Remains,"[Verse 1]
Just let it go, don't wanna argue anymore
I can't be sure, I know just what we're fightin' for
I know you're scared and that you're thinkin' I may go
I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard, it seems we've worked at this so long
It's often foolish pride that tells us we're not wrong
I hear your voice, you tell me that you'll never go
And I believe it, I believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you

And we can keep this goin' on
We'll make it work some way
And every step, it makes us
Stronger every day

And if you're thinkin' I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothin'? What if this is true?
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you
So what if I was angry? What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you
What if I was nothin'? What if this is true? (What if I was nothin'?)
What if I was nothin', girl, nothin' without you (What if I was nothin')
So what if I was angry? (What if I was nothin') What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothin' without you
"
13531,Tired,Stone Sour,"[Verse 1]
I'm alive in here, so alive in here
Pulling down a little peace
I'm open wide in here, slow to rise in here
Saving grace and killing me
You say this only makes me incomplete
I'm canceled out and rendered obsolete
Tell the mad chameleon he's not welcome anymore
I know what I'm looking for...

[Chorus 1]
Somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know, I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me; I'm just too young to care

[Verse 2]
I can see in here; I can feel in here
Comatose with common sense
I take my time in here; somebody get me out of here
What am I so against?
I just want to watch the whole world burn
Lost a million times and I won't learn
Show me someone innocent, I'll show you there's no proof
I may be gone, but I'm no fool...

[Chorus 2]
I'm not close; I'm not safe
I don't know, don't know, am I better off in chains?
The one is not aware
So stay away from me; I'm just too young to care

[Outro/Chorus]
I need somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know, I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me; I'm just too young to care
Too young to care
"
13526,Strife,Trivium,"[Verse 1]
My anxiety's clawing
Out from deep within me
It burns within as my throat
Begins to cauterize

This negativity's leeching
Any shred of composure
Rationale has decayed and left
Me bound in madness

[Pre-Chorus]
I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul

[Chorus]
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

[Verse 2]
How I yearn for the silence
For an end to the voices
The calamity grows and the
Deafness leads to disarray

Guilt buries me alive
In a coffin—criticized
I shouldered the blame and dug
This hole for me to lay in

[Pre-Chorus]
I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul

[Chorus]
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

[Interlude]
I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I...

[Solo: Beaulieu | Solo: Heafy]

[Chorus]
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

This time you better bite your tongue
Think twice before you open that mouth
Save your breath, hold it in your lungs
The urge remains, will it overcome?

I feel the tension rising high
I feel my heart pound in my chest
Not seeing straight, just seeing red

Too slow, you know you should've backed down
Didn't think before you crossed that line?

Not seeing straight, just seeing red

Do what you, what you want
If you have a dream for better
Do what you, what you want

Stand and face the unknown (Got to remember who you really are)

Screams that I have failed you

Infecting everything you love
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
Hello, hello, remember me?

Hello, hello, remember me?

We can break through

Remember who you really are
Do what you, what you want

Here's a little story how the west was won
The white man came and took out everyone
The used dirty blankets and they used machine guns
And they didn't think twice about what they've done

Here's a little story 'bout Kevin Bacon
He had a bunch of money but he got taken
He got a bunch of lawyers and he tried to sue
But Bernie looked at him and said, ""Hey, fuck you!""

Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!

You'll lose!

Tired mechanical heart
Beats 'til the song disappears

13586,Skeletons,Heartist,"I've forgotten how to feel
These nights, they chill me
Light the way to something real
And save me from myself
You chase the cold from me
With you
I'm learning to see
I just need you to know
I tried to find a way
To bury all the pain
But these skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons won't sleep
You gave me clarity
And showed me how to free
These skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons in me
These skeletons in me
How can I forget the past
If it still haunts me?
Your ghost never fades away
When I gave up everything
You took a hold of me
And proved I'm more than a broken wing
I just need you to know
I tried to find a way
To bury all the pain
But these skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons won't sleep
You gave me clarity
And showed me how to free
These skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons in me
These skeletons in me
Sympathy is hard to find
So maybe life should be defined
By all the pain we left behind;
It rots inside our minds
You make me believe
I tried to find a way
To bury all the pain
But these skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons won't sleep
You gave me clarity
And showed me how to free
These skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons in me
These skeletons in me

When all I need is to be set free
I need a little time to think
And if you ever really loved me
Then all I need is a little room to breathe

I've been through and seen a lot
Left at the bottom and the top
We're on borrowed time, but time isn't enough
I'm just trying to be the best man I can be
When I fall down, it's just me and the ground
I am no king, I have no throne

When all I need is to be set free
I need a little time to think

Whatever it takes to get you by
And all of those lies that keep you clean
Are really beneath your plastic wings

Turn on the light that keeps us blind
Holding believers under your thumb
Pulling the veil over their eyes
Speaking in fables with your electric halo

Prey on the guilty and confused
Burn all the bridges that you've used
To cross into lives to fill a hole
You'll say anything to keep control

Turn on the light that keeps us blind
Holding believers under your thumb
Pulling the veil over their eyes
Speaking in fables with your electric halo

You don't think it's hard for me
No one knows you better
You don't think I'll set you free
No one knows you better

Holding believers under your thumb
Pulling the veil over their eyes
Speaking in fables

Turn out the light that keeps us blind
Holding the levers under your thumb
Pulling the veil over their eyes
With your electric halo

13562,Try to Fight It,Shallow Side,"I can't stand the way you always lead me on
I follow blindly right behind you and I still get lost
You never look and check to see
If maybe I'm okay
This crazy world you live in
Is filled with mistakes

I, I lose it all when I speak to you
Your face, your eyes, changes what I've been through
Now, now I can't help but to scream your name
I try to fight it, I try to fight it

And I can't stand the way your lies they seem so real
Now every time I burn inside it's all that I can feel
You promise you will always change
But things just stay the same
You bend me 'til you break me and it's driving me insane
But then I see you smile

I, l lose it all when I speak to you
Your face, your eyes, changes what I've been through
Now, now I can't help but to scream your name
I try to fight it, I try to fight it

It's just the touch of your skin
The way you pull me in
I can't deny it..
'Cause I try to fight it
But then I see you smile

And I, I lose it all when I speak to you

13559,Nothing Left to Lose,Heaven's Basement,"Cover your eyes, you're not ready to see this
Better to be blind than to try and resist
Say your prayers and cease and desist, We all have secrets

Everyone nods, so what's the meaning in all this
We have a choice to live and to exist
You are mark
We don't have regrets

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

Pushed close to the edge , I can't go any further
Tear me apart with mechanical murder
Ignorant bliss in a time of disorder
God save some bastards

Nightmares come and I can't open my eyes
Running from the best, I know that I can't hide
I get knocked down shout up to the sky
I've got no regrets

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

We don't belong here
The sound of a thousand vultures
Will drown us out and confiscate our bones
We stand alone

We don't belong here
The sound of a thousand vultures
Will drown us out, and confiscate our bones
We stand alone
We stand alone
We stand alone

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

Say goodbye to the world that we once knew

13582,Drown,Theory of a Deadman,"[Verse 1]
Ebb and flow, the sea is cold, but my blood comes to boil
I feel it filling up my lungs, the weight pulls me to soil
Current takes me, breath escapes me, inducing coma sleep
Close my eyes, I'm paralyzed, finally at peace

Another sunny day, I feel like getting in the water
Why did you have to let me go?
Such a perfect way to spend my time, and swim out farther
Why did you have to let me drown?

Lay there flowing, body bloating, skin turning to gray
I build my castle, the dirty rascal finally got his way
Waves roll in and clean my sins, now everything is clear
I'm having fun under the sun, wishing you were here

Why did you have to let me go?
Such a perfect way to spend my time, and swim out farther
Why did you have to let me

A thousand leaks, I live and breathe along the ocean floor
Now submerged, I join the curse to float here ever more

[Chorus]
Another sunny day, I feel like getting in the water
Why did you have to let me go?
Such a perfect way to spend my time, and swim out farther
Why did you have to let me drown?
Drown
Drown
Drown
Drown

13553,Die Trying,Art Of Dying,"[Verse 1]
I think it's time for me to go now
I've done more harm than good
If I could change how this turned out
Yeah, you know that I would

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the weight is more than I can hold
But I’d rather fail than not know

[Chorus]
If it takes forever
I will die trying
If it takes forever
I will die trying
I will die trying

[Verse 2]
I wish I knew then what I know now
But I’d probably do the same, yeah
I get the feeling it’s planned out
From the cradle to the grave

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the weight is more than I can hold
I’d rather fail than never really know

[Chorus]
If it takes forever
I will die trying
If it takes forever
I will die trying
I will die trying

[Bridge]
I am digging a hole
I am taking it all
I am digging a hole to bury my soul
I am digging
If it takes forever
Then I will die trying

[Chorus]
If it takes forever
I will die trying
If it takes forever
I will die trying

[Chorus]
If it takes forever (Forever)
I will die trying (I will die trying)
If it takes forever (Forever)
I will die trying (Forever)
I will die trying (Trying)

13551,Torn to Pieces,Pop Evil,"[Verse 1]
Here I sit all alone like an airplane
On the edge of a sky full of solid gray
Staring at the ceiling
Tell me that I’m dreaming
Oh, I wish you were here today
All these days that I know I’ll never get back
All the words that I always wish you would’ve said
All these dreams that we had now fade to black
Try to wash it away

[Hook]
I’m torn to pieces, I’m broken down
I still see your face when you’re not around
I sit here in misery wondering if I’ll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be

[Verse 2]
Here I float through the air like a waterfall
Then I sink to the bottom like a cannonball
Having trouble breathing, suddenly I’m screaming
""Why wasn’t I good enough?""
Even though I know you’re not gonna come back
I can’t wash it away

[Hook]x2

[Bridge]
It’s tearing me to pieces
Tearing me to pieces
It’s tearing me to pieces
Tearing me to pieces

Even though I know you’re not coming back
I can’t wash it away

I’m torn to pieces, I’m broken down

I still see your face when you’re not around

I sit here in misery wondering if I’ll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be

13584,Hey Kid,Bad Seed Rising,"I meant to piss you off, it's such a big deal
We're just nowhere kids in demand with mass appeal
I got to turn it on, so I smear the make up
To keep the boys looking at me from the waist up
Forgot to call while breaking city curfew
While making eyes with who I'm not supposed to
And all you say, say, say, is

Hey, Hey kid, you've got another thing coming, coming
You think the world owes you but I ain't asking for nothing no, no
Hey kid
I ain't asking for nothing no

I meant to cut you off
I meant to interrupt
Cause you ain't saying nothing, no you just ain't saying much
It don't bother me, I don't got an attitude
I'm just who I am, from my head to my boots
Forgot to call while breaking city curfew
While making eyes with who I'm not supposed to
And all you say, say, say, is

Hey, Hey kid, you've got another thing coming, coming
You think the world owes you but I ain't asking for nothing no, no
Hey kid
I ain't asking for nothing no

Give you a piece of my heart, I think you already know
I told you right from the start, you'd never have control
I don't care, you can talk, talk all you want
Nothing's going to stop me from doing what I want

Hey, Hey kid, you've got another thing coming, coming
You think the world owes you but I ain't asking for nothing no, no

13589,Set Me on Fire,Flyleaf,"[Verse 1]
Oh, what a cold, dark world it is to walk through
Alone with a fear-filled head
Thinking of losing you is a haunted song
And a dread much worse than the fear of death

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I feel the fear rising up
Climbing up, taking over my body
And I feel my pulse starting up
Waking me again

[Chorus]
Open my eyes, I'm reaching for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire
I'm burning inside, I'm waiting for you
Set me on fire, set me on fire

[Verse 2]
Your hand in mine, oh, I feel the fire
Two hearts that beat, oh, to feed the fire

You are a spark that shines a light
Where we could belong together, factionless
Let's keep it burning bright 'til we're floating away
'Til we're ashes dancing inside the flames

Now I feel the fear rising up
Climbing up, taking over my body
And I feel my pulse starting up
Waking me again

Don't wanna be sly and defile you
Desecrate my mind and rely on you
I just wanna break this crown
But it's hard when I'm so run down
And you're so cynical
Narcissistic cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

Sometimes I hate the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me, taking its sweet time

Holding on, I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days

When love changes faces, appears from nowhere
When beautiful, lovely is ugly alone
You need me back bad, just can't be on your own

Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb
Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb

[Chorus]
I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye

Now your life is broken, revolves around love
Not love of yourself but the love you have lost
When sad desperation is lonely despair

Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb

Well, they say that we are tragic
And they say we're born to lose

You're the heathen, I'm the fool

But today you'll be the master
Or the slave it's up to you
Oh, my beautiful disaster
Take me anyway you choose

Don't fight it
Ignite it
This much I'm sure

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
It may never be this good again

It's like a new religion
Speak in tongues, come see the light
Do not trip on inhibitions
That will only waste my time

Let me tempt you with the evils
Of the flesh and so much more
Like a babylon redeemer
Like a pusher like a whore

Just try it
You'll like it
I'll give you more

I think it's time to push it to the edge

All the truth inside us
All I want is to feel
Something that's real before the end

What you see?

Kill the lights
Oh, come to me
Set it off tonight

I think it's time to push it to the edge

Ooh, you feel the hunter's gaze
A shadow even in the dark of night
Scheming your early grave
He's going to leave you dead or dying
Draining all the blood he craves
You never thought you'd be meat for the market
What'd you expect when you sold your name?

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again
To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within

Ooh, when courage takes its hold
You face down all the would-be masters
And break the ties that bind your goals
This is gonna be the moment
Your blood wakes and fills your veins
Stand tall with your strength, defy them
Become your own fate

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again
To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within

Who stands the storm and faces
The horrors that darkness breeds?
Who will take the life they're given
And cast light for all to see?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?
What's built from cowards that we praise?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides

To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within
So cast the light that hides within

You need a light just because you're so afraid

Dirty money scheme, a clean split, nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowin' as soon as the dough or the deal peak
Say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep, until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock 'til pop and radio
And record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see
That green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game
To me you're all the same, you're guilty

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same

[Post-Chorus]
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same

When did we become these sinking stones?
When did we build this broken home?
Holding each other like ransom notes
Dropping our hearts to grip our brothers' throats

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't see because you don't know
You're caught below beneath your own shadow
Stuck inside, half alive
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?
Close your mind, identify
Do you feel, do you feel, do you call this a life?
All you waited for
Drowning just to keep score
We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes, we're walking blind

Anchored in anger, we exile ourselves
Bitter blood builds our prison cells
Darker water now fills our lungs
The depths of our heart have blacked the sun

You can't see because you don't know
You're caught below beneath your own shadow
Stuck inside, half alive
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?
Close your mind, identify
Do you feel, do you feel, do you call this a life?
All you waited for
Drowning just to keep score
We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes, we're walking blind

Naked we come, naked we leave
Fools we are, to hold tightly
We are free, we are free

This is the time that we let it go
Yeah, these are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we just open our eyes (If we just open our eyes)
This is the time that we let it go
And this is the pain we are forced to know
Singing the song that's inside, inside us all, inside us all

Love gets you high

[Chorus]
Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

[Verse 1]
Time on my side
I got it all
I heard that pride
Always comes before a fall
There's a rumour goin' 'round the town
That you don't want me around
I can't shake off my city blues
Everywhere I turn, I lose

[Chorus]
Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

[Chorus]
Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

[Verse 2]
Time is no healer
If you're not there
Lonely fever
Sad words in the air
Some things are better left unsaid
I'm gonna spend my days in bed
I'll walk the streets at night
To be hidden by the city lights, city lights

[Chorus]
Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

[Chorus]
Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

[Chorus]
Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me

He, he recognized me
And punched me in the nose, he said

At the end of a dream
If you know where I mean
When the mist just starts to clear
In a similar way
At the end of today

Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see, no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 2: Roger Daltrey & Pete Townshend]
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]

His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

The golden light above you shows me where you're from
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon

They wonder where I found you

Oh, my love, it's a long way
Where you're from it's a long way

"
13616,Up Where We Belong,Joe Cocker,"Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear wind blows

Some hang on to ""used to be""
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb them a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear wind blows

Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear wind blows

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong

13604,Without You,Mötley Crüe,"Without you, there's no change
My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same
Without you, I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl you'd never, never know
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

Without you, my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
Knowing someday I'd grow strong
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only you as we grow old

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

I know that she's waiting
For me to say forever
I know that I sometimes
Just don't know how to tell her
I want to hold and kiss her
Give her my love
Make her believe
She doesn't know

You're all I need beside me, girl!
You're all I need to turn my world

You're all that I need
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
I know that she's always
There when I need her loving
I know that I never
Told her how much I love her
I see her face before me
I look in her eyes
Just wondering why
She doesn't know
She doesn't know

[Pre-Chorus]
She doesn't know

[Chorus]
You're all I need beside me, girl!
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart

Say that you'll be there
Whenever I reach out
To feel your hand in mine
Stay
Stay within my heart
Whenever I'm alone
I know that you are there
Oooooh!

You're all I need beside me, girl!
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart

All that I need
All I need to turn my world
All that I need beside me, girl!
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart

All that I need
Is for you to believe
All that I need
Is you

13605,When Doves Cry,Prince,"Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Say it!
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds likе
When doves cry

Everybody!
Huh huh huh huh huh
Say it

13647,Rain,Status Quo,"How can I see what I'm needing for
How can I give what I gave before
How can you tell me that you want me to stay
How can I stay when I'm trying to say
That I can't live without the rain
Yes I can't live without the rain

How can I feel what I'm trying to feel
How can I move when I'm heel to heel
You're always shouting about the doubt in my eyes
But I can't answer 'cos my eyes are so dry
Now I can't live without the rain
Yes I can't live without the rain

Now I can't live without the rain
That's falling on my head
Rain that's falling on my head
Rain that's falling
Rain that's falling
Rain that's falling on my head

I started thinking back to you know when
I'd like to send a line but then again
How can I write you when there ain't no light?
I'm feeling tired tonight but that is all right
Now I can't live without the rain
Yes I can't live without the rain

She trying to let me down as fast as she can

It's only love, it drives me crazy
It's only love pretty baby

It's forever, this time I know, and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is through, girl, I'll be loving you forever

13627,Go to Hell,Alice Cooper,"[Intro]
For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged
You can go to Hell

[Verse 1]
For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly
For making us doubt our parent's authority
For choosing to be a living obscenity
You can go to Hell

[Hook]
You're something that never should have happened
You'd even make your Grandma sick

[Verse 2]
You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane
You'd gift wrap a leper and mail him to your Aunt Jane
You'd even force-feed a diabetic a candy cane
You can go to Hell

13634,Astronomy,Blue Öyster Cult,"[Verse 1]
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May
And now, the sands become a crust
Most of you have gone away

[Verse 2]
Come Suzy dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you want to know where winds come from
Well, it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there, you know
At the four winds bar

[Bridge]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors barred and windows barred
One door let to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
In hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Or the light that never, never warms
Never warms, never warms

[Verse 3]
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Suzy dear
Would find themselves at the four winds bar
It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

[Bridge]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Call me Desdinova, eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent

High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?

Oh, I see his face

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?

[Verse 2]
Hot wind, moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky

[Refrain]
Oh, I see his face

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, far?
When do we leave?
Hey, I believe, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
Too many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But we don't know why
Ooh, now where do we go

All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound, as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand

Oh, I see his face

[Pre-Chorus]
Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far?
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed

In heat and rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly

But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many die
Just to see him fly
Look at my flesh and bone
Now, look, look, look, look
Look at his tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there, on the horizon
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Time is standing still
He gave me back my will
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
The place I've known
But it's not home
Ooh
Take me back
He gave me back my will
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
The place I've known
But it's not home
Ooh
Take me back, take me back
Back to my home ooh, ooh, ooh

Just getting ready, then it was time
Warpage in my figures, radios appear
Midnight was the barrier, back in 1963

Each night, the covers were unfolded
Each night, it's Suzy's turn to ride
While Charles, the one they call her brother
Covers on his eyes
Murmurs in the background
It will be time

Oh yeah!
Suzy and her brother, Charles, the grinning boy
Put me in the back seat and they took me for a ride
Yeah, the radio was on, can't you dig the locomotion
Kingdoms of the radio, 45 RPM
(Too much revolution, then)

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard]
Each night, the covers were unfolded
Each night, it's Suzy's turn to ride
While Charles, the one they call her brother
Covers on his eyes
Murmurs in the background
It will be time

It's past midnight said Charles, the grinning boy!
And looking at me greedily, said it's 1964!

Don't believe me if I tell you
That I wrote this song for you
There just might be
Some other silly pretty girl
I'm singing to

Don't believe a word
For words are so easily spoken
And your heart is just like that promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe a word
Cause words can tell lies
And lies are no company
When there's tears in your eyes

Don't believe me if I tell you
Not a word of this is true

I got lost on the road somewhere
Was it Texas or was it Canada?
Drinking whiskey in the morning light
I work the stage all night long
At first we laughed about it
My long-haired drunken friends
Proposed a toast to Jimmy's ghost
I never dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end

[Chorus]
I'm stuck here on the inside looking out
I'm just another case
Where's my makeup, where's my face
On the inside

[Verse 2]
You've got your kicks from what you saw up there
Eight bucks even buys a folding chair
I was downing Seagrams on another flight
And I worked that stage all night long (Worked that stage all night long)
You were screaming for the villain up there
And I was much obliged
The old road sure screwed me good this time
It's hard to see where the vicious circle ends

[Chorus]
I'm stuck here on the inside, I'm looking out
That's no big disgrace
Where's my makeup, where's my face
On the inside, on the inside

He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire
And as he spoke, I felt a deep desire
To free the world of its fear and pain
And help the people to feel free again

[Bridge]
Why don't we listen to the
Voices in our heart?
Cause then I know we'd find
We're not so far apart
Everybody's got to be happy
Everyone should sing
For we know the joy of life
Peace and love can bring

So spoke the wizard
In his mountain home
The vision of his wisdom
Means we'll never be alone
And I will dream of my magic night
And the million silver stars
That guide me with their light

Past midnight I still see the land
People are saying the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
The city's ablaze, the town's on fire
The woman's flames are reaching higher
We were fools, we called her a liar
All I hear is
""Burn!""

I didn't believe she was the devil's sperm
She said, ""Curse you all, you'll never learn""

Warning came, no one cared
Earth was shaking, we stood and stared
When it came no one was spared
Still I hear

13612,The Flame,Cheap Trick,"[Verse 1]
Another night slowly closes in
And I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first, you'll be the last

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

[Verse 2]
Watching shadows move across the wall
Feels so frightening
I wanna run to you, I wanna call
But I've been hit by lightning

[Pre-Chorus]
Just can't stand up for fallin' apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon

I will be the flame
I will be the flame

[Outro]
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
And whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Oh, whatever you want, I'll give it to you

I'm a wheel, I'm a wheel
I can roll, I can feel
And you can't stop me turning
Cause I'm the sun, I'm the sun

Grimy as an alley, loves me like no other lover
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little monster, baby I adore ya
Man or woman living
Couldn’t love you like me baby

Will come off in my hands

No other little girl could ever
Hold you any tighter
Any tighter than me maybe
Billion dollar baby
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe
Fighting like a dog
That's been infected by the rabies

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands

13615,I'd Do Anything For Love,Meat Loaf,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathin' fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothin' I've ever
Seen before or will again

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turnin'
As long as the stars are burnin'
As long as your dreams are comin' true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feelin'
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turnin'
As long as the fires are burnin'
As long as your prayers are comin' true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of

Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that

[Chorus]
But I'll never stop dreamin' of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Bridge: Lorraine Crosby & Meat Loaf]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
Will you hold me sacred?
Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life?
I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh no, now, I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me somethin' I can take home?
Now, I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now, I can do that
Oh no, now, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwin' around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Outro]
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

13610,Take My Breath Away,Berlin,"[Verse 1]
Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

[Verse 2]
Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

[Chorus]
My love, take my breath away

[Bridge]
Through the hourglass, I saw you
In time, you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today, I'm unafraid

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

[Verse 3]
Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love

13607,The Power of Love,Jennifer Rush,"[Verse 1]
The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now as I look into your eyes
I hold on to your body and feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender, a love that I could not forsake

[Hook 1]
Cause I am your lady and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
Lost is how I'm feeling, lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
But never wonder where I am
Cause I am always by your side

[Hook 2]
Cause I am your lady, and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love

[Bridge]
The sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on is light-years away

[Hook 2]
Cause I am your lady, and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love

We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love
Ooh, the power of love
The power of love

Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn 'bout the power of love

Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
""Forgive me if I seem out of line""
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away!

You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there, gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

It doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white
All men are equal till the victory is won
No color or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun

[Chorus - Gary Moore]
Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

[Verse 2 - Phil Lynott & Gary Moore]
It doesn't matter if you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause for which you fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag no uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun

[Chorus - Gary Moore]
Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

[Bridge - Gary Moore]
There's no communication
No one to take the blame
The cries of every nation
They're falling on deaf ears again

[Interlude - Phil Lynott & Gary Moore]
Out in the fields
Out in the fields, they are falling one by one
Out in the fields, no flag has ever stopped a bullet from a gun
Death is just a heartbeat away

Out in the fields, a heartbeat away
Out in the fields, death is just a heartbeat away
Out in the fields, a heartbeat away
Out in the fields

[Chorus - Gary Moore]
Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day

OUT!

So, it's on and on and on

Spinning fast, you gotta ride it well

The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no

You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream

This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me

Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

13692,Run to the Hills,Iron Maiden,"[Intro]
White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came, too much for Cree
Oh, will we ever be set free?

[Verse 1]
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom, the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards, attack

[Chorus]
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

[Verse 2]
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

[Chorus]
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

[Bridge]
Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square
Our breath comes on white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me, we both could've died then and there

[Verse 2]
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Cause I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes, I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

[Chorus]
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Kiss your sassafras

It’s complete, but obsolete
All tomorrows become yesterday
In demand, but second-hand
It’s been heard before you even play, yeah
Up to date, but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You’re so right, but overnight
You’re the one who has to take the blame, yeah

[Bridge]
Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can’t believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried?
Yeah-ay-ay-ay, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Don’t delay, you’re in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday’s star is Monday’s scar
Out of date before you’re even seen, yeah
At the top so quick to flop
You’re so new, but rotting in decay
Like butterfly, so quick to die
But you’re only looking for today, yeah

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can’t believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried?

Glamour trip so soon to slip
Easy come but, oh, how quick it goes

Overpaid, but soon you fade
Because you’re only looking for today, yeah

Well, I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes, I'm leaving the sorrow and heartaches
Before it takes me away from my mind

Send me love and I may let you see me
Send me hopes I can fit in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead

When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And let tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me

When you're low down and dirty, from walking the street
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet

13654,After Forever,Black Sabbath,"[Verse 1]
Have you ever thought about your soul
Can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think
That when you are dead
You just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head
Or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name
That you read in the book
When you were in school?

[Verse 2]
When you think about death
Do you lose your breath
Or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope
On the end of a rope?
Do you think he's a fool?
Well, I have seen the truth
Yes, I've seen the light
And I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared
When you're lonely and scared
At the end of our days

[Bridge]
Could it be you're afraid
Of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realise before they criticise
That God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small
That you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run?
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say that you may as well
Worship the sun?

[Verse 3]
I think it was true it was people like you
That crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had
Was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure
When your day is near
Say you don't believe?
You had the chance
But you turned it down
Now you can't retrieve

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Perhaps you'll think before you say
""God is dead and gone""
Open your eyes, just realise
That He is the one
The only one who can save you now
From all this sin and hate
Or will you jeer at all you hear?
Yes, I think it's too late

He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him, fed him by hand

Yeah! I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

Withdrawn he'd sit there
Staring into space
No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled
It seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye—and then he died

Yeah! I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

It can take forever and ever and ever and ever
But I still win

How many like him are there still
Who to us, all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands, blank and lost

...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...

I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day...""

I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to

Little child dry your crying eyes
How can I explain the fear you feel inside
Cause you were born into this evil world
Where man is killing man and no one knows just why
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again

When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 2:]
Little child you must show the way
To a better day for all the young
Cause you were born for all the world to see
That we all can live with love and peace
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again
No more presidents and all the wars will end

When the children pray let them know the way

When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealin' second after second just 'cause I know I can, but

I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from

The very worst part of you is me

I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I oughta be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in

Dangling on the edge of a lifelong dayshift
Sick of the days but they just don't work
Someone come and pull me out
I never lived a full year
And if it ain't working then it's another
So take what you need; with the rest don't bother
Someone come and pull me out
I never lived a full year
And every little need ain't your need
But you ain't the only mouth that you gotta feed
Or find a way to God
You're so wrapped up in it that you can't survive

[Chorus 1]
Your life, it ain't worth wasting mine on
Your life, it ain't worth it
No, no-no it ain't

[Verse 2]
Thinking that you're life at the time is defined by
A hammer and a nail and you just gotta like it
Someone come and pull me out
I never lived a full year
But you ain't the kind that will lose that easy
One thing you got is the will to get it right
Someone come and pull me out
I never lived a full year

Your life, it ain't worth wasting mine on (x2)
I won't accept that every day
Will just be thrown away
Because your life, it ain't worth wasting mine on

Got everything i need

Bet you were first in line

Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness
Will the ending be ever coming suddenly?
Will I ever get to see the ending to my story?

[Chorus]
Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

[Rap]
So when and how will I know?

[Bridge]
How much further do I have to go?
And how much longer 'til I finally know?
`Cause I'm looking and I just can't see what's in front of me
In front of me

[Chorus]
Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

Overbearing panic attack
Entrenching my veins
In an hour I'll be okay
I pray this pain will go away
Permanently someday

[Pre-Chorus]
I've seen more than
I should have to
I've seen this on my own

[Chorus]
This song is a poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire, break the glass
And move on into your own
Your own

[Verse 2]
Reoccurring drowning effect
Entrenching my brain
I hope you'll be okay someday
So I can say that you moved on
In the right way

[Pre-Chorus]
We've seen this and
We've breathed this and
We've lived this on our own

[Chorus]
This song is a poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire, break the glass
And move on into your own

[Chorus]
This song is a poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire, break the glass
And move on into your own
Your own

This song is a poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire, break the glass

And move on into your own
Your own
Your own

13746,All or Nothing,Lost Frequencies,"[Verse 1]
All or nothing
You know what you're doing, but the clock is ticking
Give it your best and then you're onto something
And keeps on getting closer, closer
All or nothing
Everything's silent and your head just sweating
Something not sure except the way you're heading
You know it's getting closer, closer

[Chorus]
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say ""all in"", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing

[Verse 2]
All or nothing
Take a step forward and you know she's looking
Take a deep breath before you make it happen
Keeps on getting closer, closer

[Chorus]
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say ""all in"", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing

All or nothing
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say ""all in"", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say ""all in"", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing

They blazed a trail I dared to run
They built this world and I have come
I need another, like a brother
For a cryin' shoulder

[Chorus]
This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?

Sober mind, time now is gone
They carved my body not of stone
A pretty maze of emptiness
I said, ""To hell with all the rest""

This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?

Leave me alone

You wanna see a reaction

Come on and cut me down

Please help me ‘cause I'm breaking down

Keep it inside, the image portrayed
As if I couldn't stand losing, as if I couldn't be saved, no way
A small confession, I think I'm starting to lose it
I think I'm drifting away from the people I really need
A small reflection on when we were younger
We had it all figured out, ‘cause we had everything covered
Now we're older, it's getting harder to see
What this future will hold for us?
What the fuck are we going to be?

I'm falling farther away
I'm falling farther from where I wanna be
I'm afraid I'm falling farther away
I'm falling farther away
I'm falling farther away

God will begin to speak forth
Our righteousness is of Him, sayeth the Lord.""
Get back

Can you feel, I'm not like you anymore
I can't see, I can't breathe
See you quiver like the dogs on the streets
Looking down on as I beat you

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a bad religion
From a broken nation
It's a contradiction
And I can't take it anymore
Yeah

Can you hear me? I'm alive inside of you
Agony creeps up behind you

Who or what came before this precious moment

Choosing to be here in

This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in

Spinning, weaving 'round each new experience
Recognize this as a holy gift and
Celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing
A chance to be alive and breathing

Embrace this moment, remember
We are eternal, all this pain is an illusion

13733,Southtown,P.O.D.,"[Verse 1]
Welcome to hard times
Back again like its never been, for the first time
It seems to mess with my head
So when I realize what it takes can I relate
With whatever but never will it drive me to hate
Could be the next guy that you take before I wake
Now I lay me down to sleep, eyes tight when I pray
This here is real life, circumstances make you think
Should I be counting my blessings
The next second my eyes blink?

[Chorus]
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive

[Verse 2]
One love, its easier said than done
Can I rise above everything that's in my way?
Like words you say
You let your tongue get loose
But when push comes to shove, not used to walking away
I keep on looking up, cause these times, they getting tough
Tomorrow's gone, and its the same old song
Father fill my cup, give me strength to power up
A life to shine, you're the diamond in this rough

[Chorus]
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive

Don't wanna throw up my fist, ain't gots to be like this
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
It ain't gots to be (Like this)

13708,Not Falling,Mudvayne,"[Verse 1]
Always, known in, all my time
A little left of center now
Reflect as I realize
That all I need is to find the middle pillar path
To sit like the sun by a star in the sky and just be
Sinners, casting stones at me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I, I stand, not crawling
Not falling down
I, I bleed the demons
That drag me down

[Chorus]
I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, the center
Not falling down of calms within the eye
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That pull me down for me and no one else

[Verse 2]
Goodbye, sunshine, I've put it out again, sad
I'm over, personalities, conflicting
I don't need you, or anyone, but me
I'll just be, living my own life
I feel my glowing center grow, infecting
I feel alive
Shovel dirt over lime
Plant it in myself to sit like a seed
Under covers of earth and just be
Sinners, pointing fingers at me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, by myself
Not falling down
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That drag me down

I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, the center
Not falling down of calms within the eye
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That pull me down for me and no one else

Come play kill
Refuse my body, refuse my shadow
Stone cold will
Refuse to lead this, refuse to follow
Bitter pills
Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow
I'm fueled godless
Come play, come play
Kill
Just be, just be, just be, just be, just be, just be

I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, by myself
Not falling down
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself

I love the way you look at me
I feel the pain you place inside
You lock me up inside your dirty cage
While I'm alone inside my mind
I like to teach you all the rules
I get to see them set in stone
I like it when you chain me to the bed
But then your secrets never show

[Chorus]
I need to feel you
You need to feel me
I can't control you
You're not the one for me, no

I love the way you rake my skin
I feel the hate you place inside

'Cause I'm that guy you'll never find
I think you know all of the rules
There's no expressions on your face
I hope that someday you will let me go
Release me from my dirty cage

I make my poetry everyday
And I'm frozen, comin' right on time
I froze my mind with that serious rhyme
And I'm open, comin' up inside you
Know my mind has got a grand design
And I'm flowin, goin' all the way
I make my point to be everyday, come on!

And I wanna take you down
But your soul cannot be found
Doesn't matter much, you see
'Cause your disease is killin' me
And you know it's only right
'Cause it feels like paradise
And I know nothin' is for free
'Cause your disease is killin' me

My mind's broken, I'm goin' up in smoke
If you breathe my toke, I'm guaranteein' you choke
And I'm chosen to testify for masses
Wear dark glasses like the cops in Texas
All-knowing, it's not a premonition
Kill the competition like a man on a mission
I'm blowin, comin' up inside
Like the Bee Gees' cry, I'm just stayin alive, come on!

And I wanna take you down
But your soul cannot be found
Doesn't matter much, you see
'Cause your disease is killin' me
And you know it's only right
'Cause it feels like paradise
And I know nothin' is for free
'Cause your disease is killin' me

So now I'm finally going down
Can I find my way back home?
Now there's no one else around
Can I find my way back home?
Will I ever see the light
Even though I'm fallin'?
(Will there ever be any peace for me?)
Even though I'm fallin'
(Will there ever be any peace for me?)
Even though I'm fallin'
(Will there ever be any peace for me?)

And I wanna take you down
But your soul cannot be found
Doesn't matter much, you see
'Cause your disease is killin' me
And you know it's only right
'Cause it feels like paradise
And I know nothin' is for free
'Cause your disease is killin' me

And I wanna take you down
But your soul cannot be found
Doesn't matter much, you see
'Cause your disease is killin' me
And you know it's only right
'Cause it feels like paradise
And I know nothin' is for free
'Cause your disease is killin' me

No life, but nothing's died
No lights, but quite the show

Now, now, now

[Chorus]
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in and we can get the last call
Our lives, our coal
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up, it's the picket line or the parade
Our lives, our coal

13714,Nice to Know You,Incubus,"[Verse 1]
Better than watching Geller bending silver spoons
Better than witnessing newborn nebulas in bloom
She who sees from up high smiles and surely sings
Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

[Chorus]
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you

[Verse 2]
Deeper than the deepest Cousteau would ever go
And higher than the heights of what we often think we know
Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees
To obtain a bird's eye is to turn a blizzard to a breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

[Chorus]
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you

[Bridge]
Could it be that it has been there all along?

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

[Chorus]
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you

13712,Meant to Live,Switchfoot,"[Verse 1]
Fumbling his confidence
And wondering why the world has passed him by
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments
And failed attempts to fly, fly

[Chorus]
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

[Verse 2]
Dreaming about Providence
And whether mice or men have second tries
Maybe we've been livin' with our eyes half open
Maybe we're bent and broken, broken

[Chorus]
Ah-we were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

[Bridge]
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than the wars of our fathers
And everything inside screams for second life, yeah

[Chorus]
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more (We were meant to live)
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live (We were meant to live)
We were meant to live

13718,Outside,Foo Fighters,"[Verse 1]
There you are dancin' at your altar
Beautiful earthling, dressed in kashmir
All your sound echoes through the canyons
Down below they're dreamin', hear the sirens screamin'
Another time, another world, girls were boys and boys were girls
Find the glitter in the litter
Like a haunt, it's got to move, everybody needs some room
There's something out there

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me

[Verse 2]
All I found, space between the spaces
Standin' in the nothing, and time reclaims you
And as the wind will beat you down, and the wind the only sound
There's something out there

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me

13739,Schism,TOOL,"[Verse 1]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

[Bridge]
The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

[Verse 2]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

[Bridge]
The poetry that comes from
The squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

[Verse 3]
There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second-guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

[Bridge]
Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers

[Outro]
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
And I know the pieces fit

13722,Prayer Of The Refugee,Rise Against,"[Verse 1]
Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch

[Chorus]
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down
Don't hold me up now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry and the cold
We are the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told (Oh, oh, oh)
But we've been sweating while you slept so calm in the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up everything you've known

[Chorus]
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down
Don't hold me up now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down

So open your eyes, child, let's be on our way (Hey, hey)
Broken windows and ashes are guiding the way (Hey, hey)
Keep quiet no longer, we'll sing through the day (Hey, hey)
Of the lives that we've lost and the lives we've reclaimed
Go

13734,Pardon Me,Incubus,"[Intro]
Pardon me while I burst
Pardon me while I burst

[Verse 1]
A decade ago, I never thought I would be
At 23 on the verge of spontaneous combustion, woe is me
But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never-ending calamity

I need you to hear, I need you to see
That I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility
To me

[Chorus]
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Not two days ago, I was having a look
In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, ""I can relate,"" 'cause lately, I've been
Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from
The burdens of the planet Earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy and the perils of being in 3D
But thinking so much differently

[Chorus]
Pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same
Never be the same, yeah

Pardon me while I burst into flames
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me

Cut the rope, fell to my knees
Born and broken every single time
Always keep me under finger
That's the spot where you run to me
Might see some type of pleasure in my mind

Oh, so many ways for me to show you
How your savior has abandoned you

Fuck your God
Your Lord, your Christ, He did this
Took all you had and left you this way
Still you pray, you never stray, you never
Never taste of the fruit
Never thought to question why

It's not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side
Praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed
He did it all for you
He did it all for you

Oh, so many ways for me to show you
How your dogma has abandoned you

[Verse 2]
Pray to your Christ, to your God
Never taste of the fruit
Never stray, never break never
Choke on a lie!
Even though He's the one who did this to you
Never thought to question why

[Chorus]
Not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side
Talk to Jesus Christ as if He knows the reasons why
He did it all for you, oh
He did it all for you, woah
He did it all for you

Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh...

I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out
Without hope
We're the empty set just floating through empty skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

13790,Regulate,Warren G,"WARREN G:
It was a clear black night
A clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets
Trying to consume some skirts for the G
So I could get some funk
Rollin' in my ride
Chillin all alone

NATE DOGG:
Just hit the eastside of the LBC
On a mission tryna' find Mr Warren G
Seen a car full of girls
Ain't no need to twee
Girl you skirts know whats up with 213

WARREN G:
So I hooks a left on 21 a Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said 'lets do this'
I jumped out the ride
And said 'whats up'
Some brothas pulled smoe gats so I said 'i'm stuck'

NATE DOGG:
Since these girls peepin me
Ama glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Wanna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix

MICHAEL MCDONALD:

I keep forgettin things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin

NATE DOGG:

NATE DOGG:

In need of some desperate help

One of them dames was sexy as hell I said 'ooh I like your size'
She said 'my cars broke down and you seem real nice would ya
Let me ride'
I got a car full of girls and it's goin real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

13751,What I'd Give,LVNDSCAPE,"[Verse 1]
We used to drive down to the water at night
Set fire to driftwood and then laugh till we cry
Drunk off them cheap beers that we used to buy, used to buy
What I'd give to go back in time

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm tryna keep a young heart
But I'm only getting older
Tryna keep those nights so fresh in my veins
Never in a million years
Did I think that it'd be over
Then it's like I'm floating away

[Chorus]
What I'd give
To go back, to go back again
What I'd give
To know that we both felt the same
'Cause it's hard moving on knowing all that our love has wasted away
What I'd give to go back again

[Verse 2]
For just a moment we were hand in hand
Went for a kiss that I was nervous to land
I didn't mean to spill your drink in the sand
Oh, what I'd give to go back again

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm tryna keep a young heart
But I'm only getting older
Tryna keep those nights so fresh in my veins

But you know I couldn't catch a wave if I tried
You shoulda seen your face when I nearly died
Oh, now those days are over, and I
Oh, I'm just going going under the tide

13758,44th and 8th,Sean Bradford,"[Verse 1]
44th and 8th could no longer find my way
Instantly I felt the pain
A good friend asks what's wrong
Words couldn't leave my tongue
Oh I have seen better days
""Move on, move on, be strong, be strong"" they say
Don't miss what lies ahead, the change, the change

[Chorus]
So where can I go, to get over you?
Fast forward and know, I'll get over you
Your voice keeps running though my head
Running though my head, running though my head
I'd seen another way but I can't find the exit

[Verse 2]
End the night of Berlin
Drown myself in more gin, lose myself in base
Ride the train as memories fade
As we give each other space
Try to move on, move on, be strong, be strong like they say
Embrace the change what lies ahead

[Chorus]
So where can I go, to get over you?
Fast forward and know, I'll get over you
Everything moves in slow motion
But too quick to give you what I wanted
And now I can't get over you
How do I know I'll get over you?
Your voice keeps running though my head
Running though my head, running though my head
Seen another way but I can't find the exit

You had me under your spell
And I let you under my cell
The words you said under your breath
As my fingers ran under your head

Shake my body to the ground, down to the ground

If I had a wish
I'd wanna be your blackbird up in the sky

Will turn right into water, like snowflakes in the sun

We've been apart
But it's never over
No matter where we are
And sometimes when I dream of you

It feels like you can see me too

We just need a moment
Breaking through the frozen
Rip back what they've stolen
Underneath the ice
We just need a moment
Digging out the rumors(?)
With our arms wide open
Aiming for the sky

And we light the fi-fi-fire (x8)

The only one thing higher

Twisty top of your fuckin' neck, meet ya Maker
Watchin' your mother cry bring me joy like Anita Baker (Hahaha)
My demons is evil by nature (Right)
Black talents out the Jeep; make you kiss the street (Pussy)
My favourite bitch is shootin', she bussin' then twist the leaf (Pff)
She hit the DM and meet 'em and leave 'em restin' in pieces, the bitch is lethal, I never leave her
Niggas talkin' like hustlers, I don't believe 'em (I Don't)
You nеver had coke on your fingertips unlеss you sniffin' it
I spray, that's a tone under package, made me a dummy brick
The price too good to be true, truth
I bust it open on the only corner where real COAF can food you (Hahaha)
Uh, niggas to gullible, my attitude combustable
Combined with the fact that this fourty-five-inch'll bust at you
Listen, I got no proper visitin'  where you live in I'm touchin' you (Boom)
A quick five will have the worst niggas alive discussin' you (Uh)

[Verse 2: Mickey Diamond & Scott G]
Yo, I'm too familar with bank departments, O'– (Diamond)
Ol' blue byes, my nigga, no Frank Sinatra
We still breakin' records like Curry on the court
Now tell us what you love more, the money or the sport?
Crossover, fade away it, I Micheal J. it (He's on fire!)
Stove still broke, we cook in the mircrowave, I might complain, I'm still blessed, I kill a mic a day
Run your jewels and keep tools like the NRA
I pop the steel and leave you stucked with doctor bills (Boom)
The coupe got the roof missin', like Dr. Phil, uh
We was youngans lookin' for a pipe to steal
Now these little niggas lookin' for a block to drill
It's–, it's danger in the field, no Rodney
RIP little Ronnie, it still feel funny
Niggas wasn't even twenty, fuck it, get money and be cool Before these niggas fuck around and turn your lights out, uh

13762,Tired,Alan Walker,"[Intro]
I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

[Verse 1]
Cold hands, red eyes
Packed two bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

[Chorus]
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you when your heart is tired

[Verse 2]
When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don’t talk
And if they could, they’d say
Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

[Chorus]
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you when your heart is tired

I know those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

It may be too obvious but can't you see
You take me to places, I don't wanna leave

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh

[Chorus]
When it hits me in slow motion
Then it's right where I belong
It runs deeper than an ocean
Now we've only just begun
When I'm underneath the surface
Will you ever let me go?
This could be better, stronger, deeper than

[Verse 2]
And when I turn on the lights I realise that we meet
Thinking and dreaming of what it could be
Losing myself on the breath in between
The minute you stay and the second you leave

Then it's right where I belong
It runs deeper than an ocean
Now we've only just begun
When I'm underneath the surface

13765,Wishing Well,Sam Feldt,"[Verse 1]
She drips diamonds like a glacier melts
She's self-made, down to her buckles and belts
And she's really happy, but not with a lot
And she gets her pleasures from her chemist shop

[Pre-Chorus]
She's busy, busy losing the plot
Busy, but her mind is shut
Doesn't really want it to stop
She just says now

[Chorus]
Hey there, sister
That bottle leads to hell
I ain't drinking that
Honey, can't you tell
Jump while they're swimming, this ship is sinking
Got no soul to sell, so
Hey there, mister
Throw some luck away to the wishing well
Throw some luck away to the wishing well

[Verse 2]
Don't start thinking, it messes with your head
Go with instincts, the sweet or the dead
True love is out there, it's waiting with a ring
You'll know her face the second she walks in

[Pre-Chorus]
He's busy, busy losing the plot
Busy, but his mind is shut
He doesn't really want it to stop
He just says now

Hey there, sister

Honey, can't you tell
Jump while they're swimming, this ship is sinking
Got no soul to sell, so
Hey there, mister
Throw some luck away to the wishing well
Throw some luck away to the wishing well

Hey there, sister
That bottle leads to hell

Honey, can't you tell
Jump while they're swimming, this ship is sinking
Got no soul to sell, so

Y es que contigo estoy alucinando
Porque ha llegado el día que tanto he esperado y me tiene contento
Me miro en el espejo y te veo conmigo porque
Aunque siendo novios también somos amigos
Conozco tus defectos y conoces bien los míos y eso es lo bonito

Y con los pajaritos te llevo serenata
Carlos Vives, la provincia y su parranda vallenata
Bailando esta canción que hoy te dedico
Te espero en el altar y te prometo estar contigo

Hasta que seamos viejitos
Y la piel se nos arrugue de a poquitos
De tanto reír y de tantos besitos
Ay que nos dimos, ay que nos dimos (2)

Ella sabe que su mirada es el mejor vestido
Me da un besito cada vez que se lo pido
A ella le gusta que bailemos Tropipop
Y cuando nos vamos de fiesta, le canto al oído y le digo

(Te amo) Es que me tienes loco loquito
(Tanto) Y si quieres yo te lo repito
Te quiero, te quiero, te quiero tanto ay te quiero tanto (2)

Hasta que seamos viejitos
Y la piel se nos arrugue de a poquitos
De tanto reír y de tantos besitos
Ay que nos dimos, ay que nos dimos (2)

Tengo que confesar que eres lo que soñé
Y de esos ojos tan bonitos yo me enamoré
Por ti yo me derrito y tú lo sabes
Te ves más linda cuando no usas maquillaje

Y con los pajaritos te llevo serenata
Alejandro y la provincia y su parranda vallenata
Bailando esta canción que hoy te dedico
Te espero en el altar y te prometo estar contigo

Hasta que seamos viejitos
Y la piel se nos arrugue de a poquitos
De tanto reír y de tantos besitos
Ay que nos dimos, ay que nos dimos (2)

I'm wondering if it's her
Damn I feel so insecure
Should be moving on by now
But baby tell me how
Stuck on you, stuck on you

And I guess it's kinda dumb
Cuz I know you ain't the one
I am wasting all my time
Deep inside I know you can't be mine
And baby that's alright
But I'm stuck on you

Oooooh
Slowly realise you will never be mine

I'm your slave, and I give in

I love the game, that I can't win
'Cause you're the sweetest sin

I saw you go by with your little angel face
Ruby eyes, bright smile
I followed you, I know my instincts led me to you
I got to the bar, ordered a strong tequila
To start
I saw you with your friends, I approached
Under the pretext of inviting you to dance

The song encouraged us to enjoy
Body to body you and me, the two stuck together
I whispered in your ear, ""I like you
And I want you to come with me tonight""

And drink coffee in the morning
Waking up to kisses, pleasing you in my bed
And look at your face, your smiling face
Let peoplе know that I love you and that you love me

You are on my path, like that sunset

[Intro]
Dí eso que te canta todo el mundo
No he venido a casa en casi un mes
O chocas con la verdad, no finges
Si he tenido fallas, tú también
Se hizo tarde para ser felices
Sin comentarios, yo lo sé
Cuatro mil razones hoy nos sobran
Para terminar con este estrés
Dosis de amor hacían falta
Pero ninguno cedió

[Coro]
Ahora sólo hay números en tu cabeza
De una relación que no da para más
Ahora sólo hay símbolos de suma y resta
Sumas mis errores, resto tu bondad
Ahora soy la pieza en tu rompecabezas
Que nunca hizo falta, que no encajará
Voy a enumerar todos nuestros errores
Cuando llegue a cero todo acabará

[Verso 1]
Diez - nunca me dices que me amas
Nueve - siempre cambio la verdad
Ocho - cuando salgo de la casa
Siete - casi siempre llego a las
Seis - no me agradan tus detalles
Cinco - a esta altura nos da igual
Cuatro - se nos apago la llama
Tres - casi voy a terminar
Dos - si no hay amor, no hay nada
Es oportuno el adiós

[Coro]
Ahora sólo hay números en tu cabeza
De una relación que no da para más
Ahora sólo hay símbolos de suma y resta
Sumas mis errores, resto tu bondad
Ahora soy la pieza en tu rompecabezas
Que nunca hizo falta, que no encajará
Voy a enumerar todos nuestros errores
Cuando llegue a cero todo acabará

[Verso 2]
Aquí empezó el conteo regresivo
Cuando llegue a cero se acabo
Tú te vas, yo me voy, nos vamos los dos
No hay razón para quedarnos
Tú conmigo, yo contigo
El amor está perdido  lo nuestro se termino
Sin remedio se murió
Aquí empezó el conteo regresivo
Ni te quedas aquí ni me quedo contigo
Cuando llegue a cero se acabo
Tú te vas, yo me voy, nos vamos los dos
Esto no tiene salvación
No hay solución para el adiós
Cada cual por su camino
Ya que esto no nos convino
A buscar otro destino
Por que esto fue un desatino
De los dos…
Aquí empezó el conteo regresivo
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5
Cuando llegue a cero se acabo
Tú te vas, yo me voy, nos vamos los dos
¡Camina!

[Outro]
Aquí empezó el conteo regresivo
Cuando llegue a cero se acabo
Tú te vas, yo me voy, nos vamos los dos
Si ya lo intentamos todo y nada nos funcionó
¿Qué Pasó?
Cuando llegue a cero se acabo
Tú te vas, yo me voy, nos vamos los dos
Y cuando llegue a cero
Ni me quieres ni te quiero
El amor se termino
Cuando llegue a cero se acabo
Tú te vas, yo me voy, nos vamos los dos

Cero

Anularte de mi mente, ni quemando mis neuronas

En mí la testosterona solo se activa por ti

Hombre que más ha amado a una hembra

Waiting up again, I'm always tired
Give it up and watch me go
It wasn't always just a midnight fire
You used to call me on the road

Out of love, yeah, I know you decided
Hurry up, make me feel what you don't
Come around and then you take what you want and then go

No, I don't, that feeling that you almost fine

13835,Me Tengo Que Ir,Adolescent's Orquesta,"[Letra de ""Persona Ideal""]

[Verso 1]
Me enamoré de la persona ideal
Pero a la vez, se tuvo que ir
Ay, es que el dolor que desgarró toda mi alma y corazón
Para vivir de los recuerdos de este amor
Cuando agarrados de la mano, en el parque nos besamos
Y las lágrimas caían en los pétalos de rosa
Y tristemente me dijiste así

[Coro]
Me tengo que ir
Y no es por mí, contigo está mi corazón
Todo el amor de mis entrañas
De mi pecho y de mi alma
Algún día volveré a estar aquí
Me tengo que ir
Así es la vida y tiene desilusión
Se tiene amor y hay esperanza
Cuando se quiere con el alma
Al prójimo que Dios te puso allí

[Verso 2]
Llegó otro amor de una persona ideal
Pero también se tuvo que ir
Ay, es que el dolor que había en su vientre
Un niño estaba presente
Y en sus cartas me decía que alguien perdería la vida
Y tristemente me escribió así

[Coro]
Me tengo que ir
Y no es por mí, contigo está mi corazón
Todo el amor de mis entrañas
De mi cuerpo y de mi alma
Todo el fruto de este amor te queda a ti
Me tengo que ir, ir, ir
Se tiene amor y hay esperanza
Cuando se quiere con esperanza
Al prójimo que Dios te puso allí, allí

[Instrumental]
Eh

[Refrán]
Me tengo que ir
Y no es por mí
Contigo está mi corazón
Si te quiero con el alma
Me tengo que ir
¿Por qué tienen que separar?
Contigo está mi corazón
El amor de mis entrañas

[Instrumental]

[Refrán]
Me tengo que ir, contigo está mi corazón
Me entregué en cuerpo y alma
Me tengo que ir
Ya no estarás más en mi vida
Contigo está mi corazón
Triste el adiós, triste tu partida
Me tengo que ir
Me tengo que ir
Contigo está mi corazón
Y te amaré toda la vida
Me tengo que ir
Es la verdad de una pasión cuando se entrega el corazón
Me tengo que ir

It's criminal, the thoughts inside your head
When you're fast asleep
Crimes you've committed from your bed
You've set the world on fire once, didn't you
You've set the world on fire once

It's a tragedy, waiting for the light to change
On an empty street, driving you insane

13801,Fireproof,Coleman Hell,"[Verse 1]
Did you know me and you
Must be fireproof with all the hell that we've been through
When all our lovin' lost its charm
Learned to make a shelter out in the storm (Hey)
Made it out of the cold
Climbed a mountain and I stepped on burning coals
When all our lovin' fell apart
Someone left the light on out in the dark

[Chorus]
You and I, we've both been through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire, feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof
We'll be fireproof

[Verse 2]
Did you know you and me
Must be fireproof with all these flames between our sheets
When all our lovin' was almost gone
Made some in the moonlight, yeah, before the dawn (Hey)
Made it out of the heat
Crossed the desert and we sailed the seven seas
When all our lovin' felt so wrong
Found out all the hard times just made us strong

[Chorus]
You and I, we've both been through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire, feel it getting hotter

I was thinking about the day we met
When the love came rushing out and you were empty-handed filled with regret
I was thinking about the day we met
When the love came rushing out and you were empty-handed filled with regret

[Verse 1: J-Wright]
(Yuh, Uh)
You ain't leaving my side
Girl I knew that when I met you I just keep that in mind
Swear she got me so lost watching her taking it off
Got me so love sick for you and be hearing me cough
I'm mixing liquor with love
Steady living it up
And they all see me do good watch 'em hittin' me up
Turing nothing to somethin'
You should be constantly frontin'
Now you all up in my phone sayin' my new song is bumpin'
It's hard work
And i still been taking like no breaks
Go play, all my new songs, got me up so late
Trying to write the perfect lyrics but you're too hard to describe
As I'm all up on that body girl you got me so alive
Yeah, you gotta leave I don't want you to go
Swear we're moving so fast but still be feeling to slow
I could rap a thousand words
I could make a hundred rhymes
But nothing would matter if you weren't here by my side
Lets go

[Hook: Matoma]
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes

[Verse 2: J-Wright]
Forgetting all the stress though
Let loose summer time baby lets go
Crack a bottle while we underneath the stars
Reminiscing on the memories we made it so far
Yeah even if call girl I ain't gonna answer
The way you move those hips I swear you were a dancer (nah)
Used to be chilling just on occasions
Now every weekend feeling like a vacation
Girl got me patient got me looking like that
Try and drift away but you coming right back
We living with no regrets
I'm this right here my past
Everything I'm working to is closer with every breath
And I keep breathing like I'm working it out
If your looking at my views I bet it's hurting your doubt
I could rap a thousand words
I could make a hundred rhymes
Nothing would matter if you weren't here by my side
Lets go

[Hook: Matoma]
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes

With a pocket full of dreams
I can see the black clouds arising

Shaking off my inner fears

Sand beneath my toes
I feel at ease
Tide creeping in with that summer breeze

[Chorus]
My shoulders feel light
Finally I can breath
While in the winter times
I will leave to follow that summertime breeze

Darling, you can't stay here
Come with me
How can you resist that summer breeze?

My shoulders feel light
Finally I can breath
While in the winter times
I will leave to follow that summertime breeze

13843,El Gran Varon,Willie Colón,"[Letra de ""El Gran Varón""]

[Intro]
En la sala de un hospital, a las 9:43 nació Simón
Es el verano del '56, el orgullo de Don Andrés, por ser varón
Fue criado como los demás
Con mano dura, con severidad, nunca opinó
""Cuando crezcas vas a estudiar la misma vaina que tu papá
Óyelo bien, tendrás que ser un gran varón""

[Verso 1]
Al extranjero se fue Simón
Lejos de casa se le olvidó aquel sermón
Cambió la forma de caminar
Usaba falda, lapiz labial, y un carterón
Cuenta la gente que un día el papá
Fue a visitarlo sin avisar, ¡vaya qué error!
Y una mujer le habló al pasar
Le dijo: ""Hola, ¿qué tal, papá? ¿cómo te va?
¿No me conoces? Yo soy Simón
Simón, tu hijo, el gran varón""

[Pregón]
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jamás su tronco endereza
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jamás su tronco endereza
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jamás su tronco endereza

[Verso 2]
Se dejó llevar por lo que dice la gente
Su padre jamás le habló, lo abandonó para siempre
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jamás su tronco endereza
Y no te quejes, Andrés, no te quejes por nada
Si del cielo te caen limones, aprende a hacer limonada

[Verso 3]
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jamás su tronco endereza
Y mientras pasan los años, el viejo cediendo un poco
Simón ya ni le escribía, Andrés estaba furioso
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jamás su tronco endereza
Por fin hubo noticia de dónde su hijo estaba
Andrés nunca olvidó el día de esa triste llamada

[Puente]
A-le-le-lelele, a-le-lelele
A-lelele-lele
A-le-le-lelele, a-le-lelele

En la sala de un hospital
De una extraña enfermedad, murió Simón
Es el verano del '86
Al enfermo de la cama 10 nadie lloró
Simón, Simó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ón, Simón

[Verso 4]
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jamás su tronco endereza
Hay que tener compasión, basta ya de moraleja
El que esté libre de pecado que tire la primera piedra
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jamás su tronco endereza
El que nunca perdona tiene destino cierto
De vivir amargos recuerdos en su propio infierno
No se puede corregir a la naturaleza
Palo que nace dobla'o, jamás su tronco endereza

Take it slowly
'Cause it feels like time has got something to show me
Through a crowded room, look at me like you know me
Ain't it funny how a second last forever, when we're together?
And I might get enough one day
But I won't let this feeling fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change? We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever
I'll make you stay

Don't let this feeling fade away
Don't let this feeling fade away

[Verse 2]
Don't you hurry
I will show you all the treasures that I've bury
Try to hide but you just always see right through me
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But you're the reason that I'm not leaving

I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change? We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever

Nunca es suficiente para mí
Porque siempre quiero más de ti
Yo quisiera hacerte más feliz
Hoy, mañana, siempre, hasta el fin
Mi corazón estalla por tu amor
¿Y tú qué crees? ¿Que esto es muy normal?
Acostumbrado estás tanto al amor
¿Que no lo ves? Yo nunca he estado así
Si de casualidad
Me ves llorando un poco
Es porque yo te quiero a ti

[Coro: Natalia Lafourcade]
Y tú te vas, jugando a enamorar
Todas las ilusiones vagabundas que se dejan alcanzar
Y no verás que lo que yo te ofrezco es algo incondicional
Y tú te vas, jugando a enamorar
Te enredas por las noches, entre historias que nunca tienen final
Te perderás dentro de mis recuerdos por haberme hecho llorar

[Verso 2: Natalia Lafourcade]
Nunca es suficiente para mí
Porque siempre quiero más de ti
No ha cambiado nada mi sentir
Aunque me haces mal, te quiero aquí

Si de casualidad
Me ves llorando un poco

I'm halfway gone
We fought long enough, long enough and
We were holding ropes
But untied to love, untied to love saying
If we had a moment we could ignite
Instead it seems we're trying hard to start a fight
'long these streets you read my words in the night
You hear me call

Let me come home to you, let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Your smile still echoes through my head
Let me come home to you, let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Tell me would you let me in

[Pre-Coro 1]
Pero me llegó el momento y quise ser más fuerte
Y ahora estoy tan convencida que no debo verte
Que perdí mi tiempo mientras tú ganabas
Porque valgo mucho más de lo que imaginabas

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy aquí, disfrutando la mejor versión de mí

[Pre-Coro 2]
Y porque hoy que no te tengo, tengo tantas cosas
Ahora empiezo a disfrutar un poco más las rosas
Por fa', no me insistas, tampoco lo intentes
Si ya sé que nunca cumples lo que me prometes

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy aquí, disfrutando la mejor versión de mí

[Outro]
No te toca a ti disfrutar de la mejor versión de mí

[Intro]
Uuuuh
No
No, no, no, no

[Verso 1]
Yo no sé si tú, no sé si yo
Seguiremos siendo como hoy
No sé si después de amanecer
Vamos a sentir la misma sed
Para qué pensar y suponer
No preguntes cosas que no sé, yo no sé
No sé dónde vamos a parar
Eso ya la piel nos lo dirá
¿Para qué jurar y prometer algo que no está en nuestro poder?
Yo no sé lo que es eterno
No me pidas algo que es del tiempo

[Coro]
Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana
Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo
Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí
Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos
Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí

[Verso 2]
De un cafe pasamos al sofá
De un botón a todo lo demás
No pusimos reglas ni reloj
Aquí estamos solos tú y yo
Todo lo que ves es lo que soy
No me pidas más de lo que doy, no

[Coro]
Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana
Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo
Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí
Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos
Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí

[Puente]
Esta vida es igual que un libro, cada pagina es un día vivido
No tratemos de correr antes de andar
Esta noches estamos vivos, solo este momento es realidad
No, oh, no, no sé, oh

[Refrán]
Yo no sé mañana
Esta vida es una ruleta que gira sin parar
Yo no sé mañana
Yo no sé si tú, yo no sé si yo, cómo será el final
Yo no sé mañana
Puede ser peor, o puede ser mejor
Yo no sé mañana
Deja que el corazón decida, vida mía, lo que sentimos
Mañana, yo no sé
Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana
Ahora lo que vivimos es algo realmente lindo
Quién puede saber lo que pasará mañana, no hay nada escrito
Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana
Estamos solos tú y yo
Y los momentos hay que vivirlos, hay que vivirlos
¡Oye!
Yo no sé, yo no sé
Yo no sé, yo no sé

[Coro]
Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana
Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo
Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí
Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos
Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana

Yo te ando buscando como un loco por el mundo
Y sin ti ya no aguanto un segundo
Alguien venga, dígamelo ya

Porque la busco, yo la busco y no la encuentro
Ya yo quiero que llegue ese momento
En que yo le pueda decir
Que sin ti, mi vida, no puedo vivir

La ando buscando por los siete mares
Debajo de las piedras y en mil lugares
Alguien venga, dígamelo ya

Si alguien sabe, dígamelo ya
Si ha pasado un año, un siglo o una eternidad

Ando buscando por los siete mares
Debajo de las piedras y en mil lugares

¡Opa!

[Verso 1]
Te quiero así, deliciosa, insospechada
Porque creo en tu palabra
Porque yo siento que aún te necesito
Porque me alteras las ganas
Te quiero así, estruendosa y delicada
Entre alegría y nostalgia
Porque me gusta tenerte, vida mía
Y no quiero que te vayas
Porque el amor, cuando es verdad sale del alma
Nos aturde los sentidos
Y de pronto descubrimos que la piel se enciende en llamas

Bien, tu amor me hace bien
Tu amor me desarma
Ay, tu amor me controla
Eh, eh-eoh, me endulza, me encanta

Eh, eh-eoh, me vence, me amarra, eh, eh
Mira que me hace bien, ay, que me hace bien

[Verso 2]
Te quiero así, tan precisa, equivocada
Con tus detalles que matan
Porque tenerte a mi lado me hace fuerte
Si eres mi reina y mi espada
Te quiero así, cuando ríes, cuando callas
Porque al caer, me levantas
Porque mi voz y mi espíritu se agitan
Cuando dices que me amas
Porque tu amor, como es verdad me vuelve el alma
Me despierta los sentidos
Y de pronto descubrí que aquí en mi piel se enciende en llamas

Ayer me enamoré
De la rubia que estaba bien dura, me habló en inglés
También francés
Ayer le prometí
A una rusa llevarla de compras a un mall en París
Dijo que sí

Ya todo has entregado
Casi todo has vendido

Estás desesperado en busca de cariño
Pero te gustan todas
Y no tienes dedo pa' tanto anillo

Ella me baila donde no hay luces
Yo pago el precio, ella se luce

Entras por la noche
Sales por el día

Entro por la noche
Salgo por el día

[Verso 1]
Si huele a caña tabaco y brea
Uste' está en Cali, ay mire vea!
Si las mujeres son lindas y hermosas
Aquí no hay fea para que vea

Mi Cali se está adornando para su fiesta más popular
Con caña dulce el melao hierve en la paila hasta amanecer
Habrá corrida de toros y por la noche fiesta y rumba
En Cali mirá, se sabe gozar
En Cali mirá, se sabe gozar

De día su sol ardiente hace que mi Cali se caliente
De noche sus callecitas con farolitos se ven bonitas
Afinen bien las orquestas que este año si vamo' a reventar
La rumba empezó en la sexta y vamo' a Juanchito es a rematar

Con salsa de aquí, con mucho maní
Con salsa de aquí, con mucho maní

[Estribillo]
Oiga mire vea, véngase a Cali para que vea
Oiga mire vea, goce la feria para que vea
Si uste' va llegando váyase entonando
Que de baile en baile se va acomodando
De día en la plaza corrida de toros
De noche casetas sin hembras, ni modo

Oiga mire vea, véngase a Cali para que vea
Si va uste' a Juanchito la pasa bonito
Si va al barrio obrero se vuelve rumbero
Si se me acalora, no mire la hora
Tómese un raspao' y cuento acabao

Oiga mire vea, goce la feria para que vea
Aquí no hay problema, aquí no hay pelea
Mi gente de Cali disfruta y rumbea
Pida una botella pida una caneca
Que en mi Cali bella mi gente respeta

Oiga mire vea, vengase a Cali para que vea
Vaya despacito si ya va prendido
Si va manejando, se mete en un lío
Quédese quietico, ya está amanecido
Y después de canse, váyase pa' Pance

[Estribillo 2]

Oiga mire vea, véngase a Cali para que vea
Oiga mire vea, goce la feria para que vea
Oiga mire vea, véngase a Cali para que vea
Oiga mire vea, goce la feria para que vea

[Verso final]

Qué qué qué qué qué
Querían que te cantara
Cali te canto y te cantaré
Después que pasa la feria
La rumba sigue como es
Así queda demostrado
Y aquí queda comprobado
Que las mujeres de Cali tienen sabrosura
Salsa
Porque mueven la cintura
Las mujeres de Cali tienen sabrosura
Salsa
Porque mueven la cintura

13883,Adiós Amor,Daniela Darcourt,"[Letra de ""Adiós Amor""]

Miro tus ojos y no eres feliz
Y tu mirada no sabe mentir
No tiene caso continuar así
Si no me amas es mejor partir

Desde hace tiempo ya nada es igual
No eres el mismo y me tratas mal
Y ante mi dios te podría jurar
Cuanto te quise y te quiero todavía

Adiós Amor
Me voy de ti
Esta vez para siempre
Me iré sin marcha atrás porque sería fatal
Adiós Amor
Yo fuí de ti
El amor de tu vida
Lo dijiste una vez, me lo hiciste creer
Como me duele perderte
Me resignaré a olvidarte
Porque me fallaste

Si no tiene caso continuar así
Mejor me voy
Me voy de ti

Para qué voy a mentir
Si no me amas es mejor partir
Y de una vez concluir
Con este mal que me agobia
Con este amor que me quiere destruir

Adiós Amor
Me voy de ti
Esta vez para siempre
Me iré sin marcha atrás porque sería fatal
Adiós Amor
Yo fuí de ti
El amor de tu vida
Lo dijiste una vez, me lo hiciste creer
Como me duele perderte
Me resignaré a olvidarte
Porque me fallaste

Porque me fallaste

Llevamos una luz que apagar, nadie ha podido
Rostros de mi gente rostros sencillos
Y juntos decimos ante nadie me humillo
Nada nos detiene ninguna presión
A nada le teme a esta gran nación

Frente a la oscuridad inclemente de criminales mentes
Se levantó mi gente y se limpió la cara
Aunque mi rostro es de barrio de techo de lata
Mi alma y mi esencia no la compras con plata

Pero se pone de pie y se limpia la cara
Aunque tu seas el patrón apunta bien tus armas
No sea que por justicia te toque la última bala

La tengo (Mamacita; toma)

[Verso 2: Silvestre Dangond]
Por ella bailo lo que sea, aunque suene raro
La sigo por el mundo, voy de arriba a abajo
Si con ella me voy, la saco del estadio
Se va a prender la calle si la llevo al barrio
Y pa' qué lo discuto, como tú ninguna
Viendo ese cuerpito me siento en la luna
Cante lo que cante, llena la tribuna
Revienta la pista porque es la má' dura

Ay, la tengo
Bailando reggaeton bien pega'o (Uy)
La tengo, ay, la tengo (La tengo bailando)
Hablando mi boricua canta'o (Toma)

Darme tu amor para toda la vida

Que me engañabas, que me hablabas mentiras

Dejaste que de ti me enamorara
Que me acostumbrara solamente a tu cariño
Y ahora estoy pagando mi condena

No ves cuanto me hiere tu traición
Yo que soñaba con hacerte solo mía
Con tu error me lastimaste el corazón
Si lo engañaste a él a mi lo mismo me harías

Fue imposible sacar tu recuerdo de mi mente
Fue imposible olvidar que algun dia yo te quice

Alexandra:
Tanto tiempo pasó desde el dia que te fuiste
Ahi supe que las despedidas son muy tristes
Nunca me imagine que un tren se llevara en su viaje
Aquellas ilusiones que de niños nos juramos
Todos tus sentimientos los guardaste en tu equipaje
Quiciste consolarme y me dijiste yo te amo

Desde entonces no supe que seria de tu vida
Desde entonces no supe si algun dia regresabas
Los amigos del pueblo preguntaron si volvias
Llorando di la espalda no les pude decir nada

Monchy:
Ayer que regresé a mi pueblo
Aguien me dijo que ya te casaste
Mirame y dime si ya me olvidaste
Me marcharé con los ojos aguados

Despues le pregunté a la luna
Me dio la espalda e intento ocultarse
Hasta la luna sabe que me amaste
Hasta la luna sabe que aun me amas

Y vuela vuela por otro rumbo
Ve y sueña sueña que el mundo es tuyo

Aunque mis sueños se iran contigo

Es tan triste tener que decirte que me olvides
Otro amor ha llegado a mi vida y no te quiero

Monchy:
Es muy tarde no puedo negarte que me muero
Pero no callaran mis palabras pa' decirte
Que soñaré contigo siempre que cierre mis ojos
Que entonaré por ti mis cantos tristes noche a noche
Que lloraré sin ti cuando recuerde que estoy solo
Y al recordar que duermes en los brazos de otro hombre

Me pregunto si aun reflejas algo de mi vida
Si en tu memoria vive aquel amor de tantos años
Aquel hombre que siempre te ha querido desde niña
Que llora porque el amor de su vida se ha casado

Alexandra:
Es triste ver que un tren se aleja
Y en el se va lo mejor de tu vida
Dime el motivo de tu despedida
¿Por que te fuiste dejando mil penas?

Un dia recibi tu carta
Quice leerla y era una hoja en blanco
Pues de tu vida nunca supe nada
Como preguntas que si aun te amo

13887,Como Se Perdona,You Salsa,"[Letra de ""Cómo se Perdona""]

Me dolió que me engañaras
Me di cuenta cuando hablabas
Y en la manera en que esquivabas
Mi mirada, se te notaba

Mas me dolió que fue con ella
Era mi mejor amiga
Si alguien viene y me lo cuenta
No lo creería, pero los vi

Déjame explicarte, me pasé de copas
No tuve control de mí
Fue una noche loca, no recuerdo nada
Ni por qué yo estaba ahí

Tú eres la que amo
La que más deseo
Solo vivo para ti
Solo son ideas
Quiero que lo sepas
Yo jamás te voy a herir

¿Cómo se perdona?
Cuando alguien que se ama te traiciona
Cuando tu mejor amiga te lo roba

Y te mienten en la cara
Aún sabiendo que
Esa noche yo los vi

¿Cómo se perdona?
Quién me quita ese recuerdo de mi mente
La confianza que se pierde ya no vuelve

Yo quisiera perdonarte
Pero ya mi corazón
No puede

Me dolió
No es lo que tú piensas
Que tú me engañaras
Es un malentendido

Un cristal cuando se rompe
Nunca más puede volver
A como estaba, no se repara

Déjame explicarte, me pasé de copas
No tuve control de mí
Fue una noche loca, no recuerdo nada
Ni por qué yo estaba ahí


Tú eres la que amo
La que más deseo
Solo vivo para ti
Solo son ideas
Quiero que lo sepas
Yo jamás te voy a herir

¿Cómo se perdona?
Cuando alguien que se ama te traiciona
Cuando tu mejor amiga te lo roba

Y te mienten en la cara
Aún sabiendo que
Esa noche yo los vi

¿Cómo se perdona?
Quién me quita ese recuerdo de mi mente
La confianza que se pierde ya no vuelve

Yo quisiera perdonarte
Pero el corazón, amor
No puede

¿Cómo se perdona?
¿Cómo se perdona?

Cuando se pierde confianza
Cuando el amor te traiciona

¿Cómo se perdona?
¿Cómo se perdona?

Yo te pido perdón, mujer
Lo que pasó esa noche
No es lo que crees

¿Cómo se perdona?
¿Cómo se perdona?

No insistas, no
Ya no hay marcha atrás
Prefiero quedarme sola

Mujer infiel y traicionera
Prefiero la soledad que tu medicina de amor
Y ya no quiero que vuelva
Yo que fui su novio primero

Que me la devuelvan
Me la pusieron difícil
Con una que es peor que Nereida
Así que dame, un billón

13888,Mala,Mr. Don,"Bebe, se que tu no creías en amor a primera vista
Y yo que soy temerario, no tengo miedo a perder
Haré una dictadura si el destino me separa de tu piel
Porque la vida no avisa

Voy asegurarme que el amor no se arrepienta y no se apague lo
Que siento, voy hacer un pacto entre mis besos y tus labios
Para detener el tiempo

Y si no hay mañana yo te juro еs el momento
Para desvеstir tu corazón haz el intento
Venci la teoría que lo nuestro es incorrecto
Y ya esta en agonía ese maldito sufrimiento

Ay olvídate del exterior entrégame tu corazón
Escribire en tu habitación
Aquella historia de los dos baby
Aquí el que manda soy yo

Y si no hay mañana yo te juro es el momento
Para desvestir tu corazón haz el intento
Venci la teoría que lo nuestro es incorrecto

Ay olvídate del exterior entrégame tu corazón
Escribiré en tu habitación

Αν πάλι κάτι μέσα σου διστάσει
Μέχρι το πρωί θα μ’ έχεις χάσει

Siente lo que siento yo
Derritiendo el frío porque vengo con mi gente
(Oh-le-oh-lei)
De la tierra son las estrella' y del cielo son los pionero'
De las nubes salen los fuego', los que no se apagan con hielo
Quien le tiene miedo al sereno no resiste ni un aguacero
Báilalo, que esto está bueno, muévelo, que esto es un juego

[Verso 1: Residente, Residente & Ricky Martin]
No, no
No quiero un trofeo gigante
Como Héctor, yo lo que quiero es que mi gente cante
Vamo' pa' 'lante
Hoy no nos paran ni con tranquilizante de elefante
El dinero, aunque sea abundante, no vale
Aquí todo' somo' importante'
Con el mismo semblante, suda'o y sin bañar
Pero comoquiera elegante'
Esa cadera mírala cómo cocina
Gourmet como bacalao sin espina'
Llovió y esto no se ha acaba'o
Bailamo' hasta con los zapato' moja'os
La' cara' linda' que lindas son
Pa' esa sonrisa un besito 'e bombón
Corazón de melón, melón
Agarra tu pareja antes de que suene el trombón

Que lo baile San Juan, que lo baile La Habana
Apreta'íto y bien suda'o como en Copacabana
Que mala ere' Juliana
Demasia'o de sabrosura como pa' no verte mañana
Con los pies caliente' y la cerveza fría
Deja que el alma monte la coreografía
Que yo tampoco sé bailar, pero confía (Ey, ey, ey)
Que aprendo antes que salga la luz del día (Ey, ey)
Muévete como tu bandera
El tiempo pasa y por nadie espera
La calle está prendí'a, está en candela
Bailando sin zapato' con los pie' acapella
Con orgullo te digo dónde está mi abuela
Gracias Maelo y Lavoe por la escuela
Que cante mi gente, le' prendo' una vela
Con Cristo mirando toda' las favela', yeh

Amores que causan, las chanzas, señalan

Somos dos payasos en un circo de amor

[Verso 1]
Tu curaste mi canto
Secaste mi llanto, bebimos del sol
Por caminos que el viento se llevó
Tu rezaste a los santos
Vestiste de encanto y de ilusión
El recuerdo que el tiempo nos dejo

[Puente]
Quiero todo de ti, toma todo de mi
Basta ya de ver quien tiene la razón
Siempre aguantando
Sudando mal de amor

[Estribillo: Vicente García, Coro]
Siempre ahí ahí
Deja que tu beso se acostumbre a mi pasión
Siempre te escondes
No dejes que a mi abrazo se le olvide tu calor
Siempre ahí ahí
Cuando no se entiende el corazón con la razón
Siempre
Vivo por tus besos muero en mi dolor

[Verso 2]
Despertar, desvestir el día con tu cuerpo
Siempre siento que es soñar que me voy volando con el viento
Atravieso el mar, sol sobre horizonte amaneciendo
Tu me ves llegar y el mismo cuento

[Estribillo: Vicente García, Coro]
Siempre ahí ahí
Deja que tu beso se acostumbre a mi pasión
Siempre te escondes
No dejes que a mi abrazo se le olvide tu calor
Siempre ahí ahí
Cuando no se encuentra el corazón con la razón
Siempre
Vivo por tus besos muero en mi dolor

[Outro: Vicente García, Coro]
Te escondes
Vivo por tus besos, muero en tu dolor
Siempre ahí ahí
Por qué no vuelve a mi
Si yo te espero aquí
Bajo la sombra del mango
Tu sabes cuanto cuanto cuanto mamá
Siempre ahí ahí
Curaste mi canto, secaste mi llanto
Bebimos del sol
Siempre ahí ahí
Siempre ahí ahí

13859,No Te Contaron Mal,You Salsa,"Letra de ""No Te Contaron Mal"" ft. Amy Gutierrez

Voy a contestarte ahora mismo
Todas tus preguntas
Pa' dejarte bien claro
Qué fue lo que pasó

La noche en que me dejaste
Pasaron cosas
Las mismas cosas que tu amigo
Ya te contó
¿Y sabes qué?

No te contaron mal
No te voy a negar
Si nos besamos
Nos entregamos

Pero hasta ahí nomás
Fueron unos cuántos besos
Dos o tres caricias
Me ganó el deseo

De que fuera mio
Hubo coqueteo
¿Y pues yo que hacía?

No te contaron mal
Estuve con alguien más
¿Qué te hace daño?
Si no fue en tu año
¿Qué tienes que opinar?

Si no fueron muchas
Solo fue con uno
Si andaba de fiesta
Era culpa tuya

Y al final de cuentas
Uno no es ninguno
No te contaron mal

No te contaron mal
No te voy a negar
Si nos besamos
Nos entregamos
Pero hasta ahí nomás
Fueron unos cuántos besos

Dos o tres caricias
Me ganó el deseo
De que fuera mio
Hubo coqueteo

¿Y pues yo que hacía?
No te contaron mal
Si estuve con alguien más
¿Qué te hace daño?

Si no fue en tu año
¿Qué tienes que opinar?

Si no fueron muchos
Solo fue con uno
Si andaba de fiesta
Era culpa tuya
Y al final de cuentas
Uno no es ninguno
No te contaron mal

No te contaron mal
Nos besamos
Nos entregamos
Pero hasta ahí nomás
Fueron unos cuántos besos
Dos o tres caricias nada más

No te contaron mal
Si nos besamos
Nos entregamos
Y me ganó el deseo
Pero hasta ahí nomás
De que podria ser mio
No te lo voy a negar

No te contaron mal
Nos besamos
Nos entregamos
Pero hasta ahí nomás

¿Qué te hace daño?
Si no fue en tu año
No tienes que opinar

You Salsa dice

No te contaron mal
Estuve con alguien más
¿Qué te hace daño?
Si no fue en tu año
¿Qué tienes que opinar?
Si no fueron muchos
Solo fue con uno

Si andaba de fiesta
Era culpa tuya
Y al final de cuentas
Uno no es ninguno
No te contaron mal

Ya no recuerdas mis locuras ni el amor aquel
Estás tranquila, lo mereces, siempre fuiste bien

No me sorprende, sospechaba terminar así
Yo solamente fui la excusa para hacerle ver
Que tú podías, si querías vivir sin su amor
Perdóname
No me di cuenta de ese juego y me enamoré
Después fue tarde, no podía ya volver atrás
Y te quería cada día más y más

Que puedes hacer lo que quieras tú

Que no me odias y preguntas siempre algo de mí

Discúlpame
Aquellos celos tan intensos que sentí por ti
Estaba loco, casi loco, por aquel amor
Y al poco tiempo para siempre lo perdí

(Tú con él) Aún recuerdo el romance que viviste conmigo
(Tú con él) Yo sé que jugaste con mis sentimientos

Cuándo y cómo darte un beso
Yo en cambio encuentro el punto débil
Que te eleva hasta el exceso
Y ni siquiera se imagina de ese pacto misterioso
Con tu alma y tu cerebro
Tendrías que volver a nacer
Para ver si en otra vida te enamoras de él
No tiene la táctica adecuada pa' arrancarme de tu pecho
Yo, que te fallé a ti mil veces, sigo siendo tu dueño
Que me pregunte cómo te conquisté
Que anote mis truquitos en papel
No basta los modales y ser fiel
Si tú deliras por el malo que te eriza la piel

[Interludio]
Oye
Escucha las palabras
De Romeo
So nasty!
Yes, sir!

[Coro]
Tú serás la Cinderella
Él, el tonto que da pena
Y aunque yo no sea un príncipe azul
Soy tu amor y tu dilema
Y al igual que en las novelas
Soy el malo con una virtud

13909,Quítame Ese Hombre,Gaby Zambrano,"[Letra de ""Quítame Ese Hombre""]

Quítame el recuerdo que me dejó
Quítame el vestido, destrózalo
Bájame del cielo donde me llevó
Bájame y de nuevo súbeme hasta el sol

Quítame esa idea de serle fiel
Quítame el deseo de estar con él
Déjame en la mente
Ganas de volver a verte

Quítame ese hombre del corazón
Quita de mi cuerpo su sensación
Anda quítalo tú, anda inténtalo tú

Borra con tus labios lo que él beso
Llega donde nadie jamás llegó
Anda inténtalo tú
Anda inténtalo tú

Quítame la venda que me cegó
Quítame de golpe esta obsesión
Siempre queda espacio para un nuevo amor
Siempre, si el que llega es muy superior

Quítame esa idea de serle fiel
Quítame el deseo de estar con él
Déjame en la mente
Ganas de volver a verte

Quítame ese hombre del corazón
Quita de mi cuerpo su sensación
Anda quítalo tú, anda inténtalo tú

Borra con tus labios lo que él beso
Llega donde nadie jamás llegó
Anda inténtalo tú, anda inténtalo tú

Quítame, quítame el deseo de darle amor
(Quítame ese hombre de mi corazón)
Dile que lo reemplacé con tu cuerpo, tu beso, tu calor

Ay, quítame de golpe esta obsesión (quítame ese hombre de mi corazón)
Quítame el vestido a tu manera, ven y destrózalo

Ven y compone el corazón que aquel desarmó
(Quítame ese hombre de mi corazón) dame tu amor, dame tu amor
¡ay, dámelo, dámelo, dámelo!

¡Gaby Zambrano, ¡Dícelo!
¡Sube!

Arráncalo lléname de placer (sácalo de mi alma)
Hazle saber que yo, yo, yo soy tu mujer

Y bórrame la cicatriz que me dejó (sácalo de mi alma)
Sácalo de mi alma ven y dame la calma, mi amor
¡Dícelo!

Ella miró oh si! ella pasó oh no!
Ella se volvió con una sonrisa

La invité y puso brinca
Y enseguida quise jalarla pa' la pista

Bailamos tres merengues de corrido y gozamos
Luego nos sentamos, ordenamos bebidas y conversamos
She look good, so of course I lied all my girls from the hood
Ella preguntó si tenía novia y yo dije no
Me quité el anillo, despacito me lo metí en el bolsillo
Vino un descarado y me dijo ¿tú no eres casado?
Me quedé pasmado y enseguida se la llevó de mi lado
Oh my god ese tiburón

13913,El Que Siempre Soñó,Issac Delgado,"Eguramente, no quedo mas solución
Que separarnos, a pesar
De nuestro amor
Y no te niego que quizás
Fue lo mejor después de todo

Para entendernos no bastaba
Con querer
Para querernos no faltaba
Madurez
Pero del fuego que encendimos
Una vez queda el polvo

Que no se te olvide
El mas pequeño sorbo
Del pasado
El sueño mas querido y
Mas soñado
El beso que nos dimos
Como adiós

Que no se te olvide
Que mientras haya el ultimo
Recuerdo
Es como si viviéramos de nuevo
Sabiendo que tu piensas
Aún en mi

Para poder vivir

Te hecho de menos esa taza de café
Que preparabas nada más al atardecer
Y los censados que solíamos tener
Por tonterías

Te sobra tiempo y no se
Que hacer con el
Hago proyectos que se mueren
Sin hacer
Es que la vida
No me va ni mal, ni bien
Sin tus caricias

Que no se te olvide
El mas pequeño sorbo
Del pasado
El sueño mas querido y
Mas soñado
El beso que nos dimos
Como adiós

Que no se te olvide
Que mientras haya el ultimo
Recuerdo
Es como si viviéramos de nuevo
Sabiendo que tu piensas
Aún en mi

(Que no se te olvide)
Lo que yo te di era solo para ti mami
(Que no se te olvide)
Quiero que sepas que nunca te he olvidado
(Que no se te olvide)
Acuérdate de mi
Que la llama del beso vive
(Que no se te olvide, mi amor)
A mi me falta tu querer y lo quiero tener
Que no se te olvide

(Que no se te olvide)
Ay mami lo que bueno pa ti es sabor
(Que no se te olvide)
Tu enamorada, tu enamorado
(Que no se te olvide)
Vuelve pa que tu negro te mime y te cuidé
(Que no se te olvide)
Que no me falte tu amor para siempre
Eeehh

(Y yo siempre te amaré)
(Y yo siempre te amaré
Siempre te amaré

(Que no se te olvide y yo siempre te amaré)
Que te olvido, que te olvidé
A mi que nada se me olvida
Que no, que no

(Y yo siempre te amaré)
Que yo me muero, sin tu amor
A mi lado

(Que no se te olvide y yo siempre te amaré)
Es que quiero tenerte
Porque amando es que se vive

13928,Siempre Tan Ron,Vicente Cifuentes,"Siempre te he dicho que te quiero
Siempre tú has sido para mí
Una ventana y un consuelo
El pasaporte que perdí

Siempre te veo en lo que hago
Incluso cuando equivoqué
Le diste fuego a mi cigarro
Y yo no sé si lo fumé

Parece un mar
De fuego y mineral
Aprendí a ver
Y a conocer tu soledad

Mi corazón
Tan malherido
Siempre tan ron
Como los vientos prometidos

[♪]

Siempre que caigo demasiado
Hay alguiеn para contener
Estabas tú en еl otro lado
Cuando lo tuve que aprender

Por eso abrázame, y tranquilo
Tu mundo entero ya esta aquí
El que te vino a dar asilo
Para ponerle punto al fin

Parece un mar
De fuego y mineral De fuego y mineral
Aprendí a ver
Y a conocer mi soledad

Tu corazón Tu corazón
Tan bienvenido  Tan bienvenido
Siempre tan ron
Como los vientos prometidos

Y tú eres de madrugar
Es tan extraño que el tiempo

Cuando todo es igual

Y yo no paro de hablar
Es mágico y divertido

13901,Amor De Una Noche,N'Klabe,"Vaya N'Klabe
Ta pasando voltio
Mi pana mi pana te veo con la depre
Hermano tu sabes
Que pajo consul

{Hector:}

Ella me entrego su cuerpo
En una noche cualquiera
Luego abandono mi puerto
Como un barco de vela

{Felix:}

Ella me detuvo el alma
Fue un reloj sin manecillas
De repente estaba solo
Cuando amanecia

{Ricky:}

Todo se cambio esa noche
Hasta el color de las estrellas
Todo fue tan diferente por ella

Por que te fuiste (socio pero buscala) y no dejaste huella

{Felix:}

Me vuelvo triste

{Hector:}

No encuentro tu silueta

{Ricky:}

Desde la noche aquella

{Hector:}

Luz que se desaparece

{Felix:}

Amor que se va y no vuelve

{Ricky:}

Pero que me surge al alma
Como un fuego que crece

{Hector:}

Y yo te sigo soñando
Procurando que aparezca

{Felix:}

Ese amor que me hace falta
Ese amor que me alimenta

Todo se cambio esa noche
Hasta el color de las estrellas
Todo fue tan diferente por ella

Por que te fuiste (ven aca tu te quieres casar) ,y no dejaste huellas

{Felix:}

Me siento triste

No encuentro tu silueta

Es como un sueño del
Que no quiero escapar
Y es que tu imagen no se pueda revelar

Socio buscala dale perciguela si te la encuantras hablale bonito
Y convensela pero no pierdas tu orgullo de hombre
Si ya te la gosaste olvidala

Te dio de la que envisia o de la que enchula

Hasta de color ya cambiaron las estrellas
Pero si no aparece papi olvidate de ella

Todo se cambio esa noche(voltios ya se fue)hasta el color de las estrellas(se me fue)

Las mujeres de hoy en dia tienen muchas babillas
Te paso por encima y no le cojiste la tablilla

Eso le pasa a cualquiera una ves me paso
Si ella no quiere dile que se lo perdio

Noche de calentura y de aventura y derroche

Nos tomamos una cerveza, porque esto está caliente

Formamos una locura, prendido de su cintura
Y nos fuimos mar adentro, donde nos llevará el viento

Y hoy ando pero ando muy sola
Sola como va la brisa
Mozo tu no me decías
Que se iba a cansar tu risa

Risa que fue calentando
De poquito a poco la mirada mía

Mozo porqué me dejas
Tan así de pronto
Y sin decir nada
Porque me dejas

Mozo porqué me dejas
No dices como, ni cuando
Solo me dejas

Cuando andando por tu barrio
Yo me encuentro a tus amigos
Me dicen que te ven muy triste
Triste por haberte ido

Y eso es lo que yo no entiendo
Amor tu sabes bien
Cuanto es que yo te quiero

Mozo porqué me dejas
Tán así de pronto
Y sin decir nada
Porqué me dejas

Mozo porqué me dejas
No dices como, ni cuando
Sólo me dejas

Ya no quiero saber nada de tí
Ya no quiero saber nada

Mozo tú me dejaste
Tan así de pronto
Y sin decir nada
Tú me dejaste

Mozo ya me olvidaste
Ya me olvidaste
Verdad que sí
Ya me olvidaste

[Clarinet]

Mozo tú me dejaste
Tan así de pronto
Y sin decir nada
Tú me dejaste

Mozo ya me olvidaste
Ya me olvidaste
Verdad que sí
Ya me olvidaste

Mozo tú me dejaste
Tan así de pronto
Y sin decir nada
Tú me dejaste

Mozo ya me olvidaste
Ya me olvidaste
Verdad que sí
Ya me olvidaste

Ya no quiero saber nada de tí
Ya no quiero saber nada

Dame de tu vida y de tu tiempo
Suficientes para ver
Dentro de tus ojos el momento
Que me obligue a renacer

Dame vida y dame aliento
Que yo ya perdí el conocimiento
Sólo quédate un momento
Hasta evaporarnos en el viento

No hay motivos para decirnos adiós tan pronto
Sigo vivo créemelo mi amor no soy tan tonto

Si tú quisieras esta noche
Ir a bailar un chachachá
Yo te puedo enamorar

Dame de tu vida y de tu tiempo, oooh

Déjame sentir el movimiento, oooh

Voy manejando por la noche y pienso en ti
Y en tantas cosas que no te llegué a decir
Y la luna desde lejos me acompaña
Y me trae tantos recuerdos que perdí
Y la radio esta tocando tu canción
La que bailamos tantas veces tú y yo
Y la lluvia cae tan fuerte en mi ventana
Y se evapora como gotas de tu amor
Y las luces de los autos brillan como las estrellas en el cielo del dolor
El camino va pasando y yo voy acelerando como quien busca el amor
Yo te busco como un loco

Dime
¿Dónde estarás?
¿Dónde estarás?
¿Todavía piensas en mí?
¿Dónde estarás?

Quiero saber si todavía te quedará un poquito de amor por mí
La carretera se hace larga y yo siento que puedo morir

Voy manejando, creo que va salir el sol
Qué diera yo por estar en tu habitación
Tu contestador responde mi llamada
Dejo grabado un mensaje con mi voz
Y te digo que te extraño
Que eres tú toda mi vida
Que me ahogo el alcohol
Que no acepto que termine
Esta historia tan bonita
Esta historia de los dos
Que ese tipo que pretende
Secuestrarme tus caricias
No va ser mejor que yo
No lo dudes
Mi amor

13927,Solo Le Dije,Kevin Johansen,"Solo le dije ""necesito un tiempo”
Y ahí comenzaron los problemas
Porque uno es esclavo de sus hazañas
Pero dueño de sus intentos
Y puedo callar casi todo lo que pienso
Pero no puedo con mis sentimientos…
Solo pedí un poco de tiempo para mí
Ahora ya no sé si soy feliz con tanto tiempo…
Solo le dije, ""démonos espacio”
Y de pronto me vi eyectado hacia el cosmos
Y ser astronauta nunca fue lo mío
Pero sí entender por qué somos como somos
Puedo callar casi todo lo que miento
Pero no puedo con mis sentimientos…
Solo pedí un poco de tiempo para mí
Ahora ya no sé si soy feliz con tanto tiempo…
Ya no sé quién soy, desde el living a la cama voy
Ni siquiera sé qué día soy con tanto tiempo…
""Puede fallar"" ya lo dijo el Maestro
Pero qué logro si ni siquiera intento…
Solo pedí un poco de tiempo para mí
Ahora ya no sé si soy feliz con tanto tiempo…
Era calavera ayer, hoy pregunto si ser o no ser
Ya no sé qué más se puede hacer con tanto tiempo
Solo le tiré ""démonos espacio y libertad”
Ahora tengo un bulo en el Le Park con mucho tiempo…
Solo le dije ""necesito un tiempo”

¡Es lo único! Si a mi casa no vas más
Olvidate, ¿okay? Olvidate de todos esos asuntos
Y toda esa parafarnalia que vivimos juntos
Y todo el menguele que te doy desde mi corazón

Y olvidate de Tito
Y de los caminos al río, oh

[Outro]

O bicho tá pegando
A chapa esquenta
O tempo passa mas a evolução é lenta
Mas não tenho pressa
Velocidade é essa
Não há nada nesse mundo
Compadre que me estressa
Porém Ah Porém
Há um caso diferente
Que envolve toda a minha gente
Não se embucha de ninguém
Fica do lado do bem
Atitude, amor e respeito também
Eu vou no samba é gente bamba
A diferença é clara
A gente fuma e eles fama
Proteja a raiz pra que tenha bons frutos
Já diz o velho ditado
Eu vou no samba
Eu vou no samba

Siento que tu respiración
Es el oxígeno de esta habitación
Mis ojos descansando y todavía estás
Dormida o despierta, nunca te me vas

Ahí veo tu cuerpo recostado del sofá
Quisiera entrar en tu sueños pa' vivir contigo
Y lo que en tu mente está
Yo sueño contigo quisiera despertar
Y cuando abra los ojos ahí tu vas a estár

Se que no todo es bueno
Siempre hay un lado obscuro, ahora no lo encuentro

Ay mamita negra portase mal contigo a mi me alegra

Si tiene pesadillas, ahí yo voy a estar
Uy siento que me miras, me muevo sin pensar

El camino de lo aprendido
Volver, volver, volver a recuperar

Llamando a tu puerta estoy
Por las ramas ya me he ido
Se acaban las palabras y nos queda el cuerpo
Rendido

Qué será? Que esa noche
Ya estaba ilusionada por venir a mi casa
Y de un vino a una balada
Un beso click, toco mi alma
Desde el suelo hasta mi cama
Dibujo el amor
Con alas, sus alas, mis alas

Llega vida, por su vida, por su voz,por su risa
Yo que nunca llevo prisa
Me calme mas cada dia
Que es el mar y la armonia
Por ver en su luz, infinita luz

Que será? que la miro y del mundo material
Asi me olvido
Conexion espiritual

Ni duda cabe la confianza magica
La solucion de las señales
Todas estas cosas bellas
Consecuencias son

Solo se que de decirlo
No sera algo que acabe
Con el mistico fulgor de nuestra accion
La vida es clave

Un dia nos junto, en infinita luz

Não há pior sentimento que o arrependimento
Mais patético eu me sinto quanto mais eu me lamento
Passado é passado, foco tá no meu futuro
Sem controlo no presente tipo dei um tiro no escuro
Nova escola tá a tremer tipo tem parkinson
Triplos com as minhas tranças, sou a resposta tipo o Iverson
Niggas tão franzinos tipo a Telma, sem problemas
Surro niggas tipo o Bruce, lhes levo tipo o Addison (Lee)
Chamem todas as crews de rap e chamem a M.O.B
Já que os outros grupos andam fracos de QI
Quanto à MOB eles me sabem, tentam ficam sem esqueleto
Rompo todos faço ponta, de esquebra beefo o Gilberto
Como o Fredh Perry disse: eu mando no meu teto
Tenho vos dormido tanto, peçam alambamento
Nem consigo andar direito, tou 14-15
Meu bolso tá mais pesado que os implantes da Bernice
Manequim challenge na tua dama, ela vai tar em saltos
És um fala tão barato nem precisas saldos
Só faço as minhas notas tipo que o meu nome é Aldo
Levantamentos no banco como eu levanto o estádios
Ficamos mais caros e promotores tao resmungões
Todos deram conta que a nós não compram com ilusões
Já tou farto de intrujões, cabrões e mijões
Então o fake eu corto com a precisão de cirurgiões
Aqui ninguém mais quer o trono, já foi conquistado
Tamos todos a correr tu podes ficar lá sentado
Só atendo se for money, se não dá ocupado
Porquê que o.. fugiu? Já tá explicado
Latino tá a explorar Angola tipo o Diogo Cão
Respiras o mesmo ar que nós e pagas comissão
Um conselho muito honesto não te armes garanhão
Porque os dedos no gatilho do canhão têm comixão

(Coro - Xuxu Bower)
Ah não, sou o best rapper
Ah não, o meu pai tem paper
Ah não, arrastei a Bitch
""Xe wi o corno não é esse wi?""
Ah não, babies tão a calling
Ah porque, todos dias ballin
Ah, uso cartier dos kotas
Mas lá no biva ainda esconde as notas

(Verso 2 - Mendez)
Eu vim mudar o episódio
Fermentar o vosso ódio
Tou ma cagar, trás imodium
Nigga eu vos tirei do pódio
Deixei claro tipo sódio
Que eu sou um preto sem maneiras
Mato e não vou preso, Anna Mae pra esses haters
Barras na folha tipo um designer de celas
Talento é mais cobiçado que as morenas em Benguela
Ela pensa que eu sou estrela de novela mas lhe deixo com mazelas
Sou um nigga do Cacém, mesmo assim eu a cruzo em Chelas
E eu tou atrás do meu Picollo
Dou cabelo a niggas Krilin, lambo conas Majin Bu!
E a tua baby nigga aqui colou
Então não penses que tu fodes, nigga ouve ""Quem És Tu""
Pussy suave pra minha vara dura, bambu
Tantos caracóis a shawty vê, quer logo por Cantu
Tava armada em fina, só chorava pra ir ao Nobu
Acabou no KFC, não entendia o menu
E o goal é ter mais nomeações do que menções na net
Rappers tão a retroceder no game, vão lançar disquete
Antes talento mandava, hoje em dia é diferente
Hoje dj's só te tocam se fizeres um bom minete
Quero ser colega da Isabel na Forbes
Outros niggas viram cornos, colegas do Nery Borges
Tou dentro dum Porsche, skr, já me sinto o Felix
Buzz tá pesado nigga, Mendez Obelix

Camine triste por la vereda
Y me cruce con un tren
Me chanco una rueda
Y me empece a sentir bien

La historia no iba tan negra
Pero era de necesitar
Un poquito de afuera
Para poder armonizar

Su paso de caribeña
Caribeña, caribeña
Caribeña, caribeña, caribeña
Si la ves triste no la dejes ir

Cada vez que entraba la pena
Me volvían a pisar
Unas hormiguitas negras
Que me hacían carcagear
Y ya casi riendo de todo
Lo volví a ver pasar
Era el miedo con nuevo apodo
Que quería desordenar
Mi paso de caribeña
Caribeña, caribeña
Caribeña, caribeña, caribeña
Si la ves triste no la dejes ir

14017,I'll Play The Fool,Claude Fontaine,"[Verse 1]
I'll never live a life of regret
Some things you’re certain are surely kismet
If the tides turn and they pull us apart
It wasn't in the stars

[Verse 2]
What do I care who's wrong or who’s right?
As long as it's you who's holding me tight
Why waste our time even if we just met?
Why play hard to get?

[Chorus]
I'll play the fool
When love is cruel
Maybe I'll learn the next time
Why play it cool?
Love knows no rules
As long as it's you that I call mine

[Verse 3]
I ask myself when I'm in a bind
When will you see that love can be blind?
How do you hold yourself up when you fall?
You win or you lose it all

[Chorus]
I'll play the fool
When love is cruel
Maybe I’ll learn the next time
Why play it cool?
Love knows no rules
As long as it’s you that I call mine
I'll play the fool
When love is cruel
Maybe I’ll learn the next time
Why play it cool?
Love knows no rules
As long as it's you that I call mine

[Verso 1]
Comienzo a sentir la ebriedad de la realidad
Las cosas que me sorprendían
Hoy en día, ninguna me deslumbra de verdad
Los fantasmas que intento atrapar
Se me escabullen en los brazos
Tendría que aceptar mi realidad
O pedirle a los astros que tengan piedad
Aquí estoy trabajando y no pierdo la dignidad
Con este hambre voraz, queriendo siempre más y m\as
Creyendo que algún día iba a poder saciar
Fantasiando que en algún momento de la vida
Me crecerían alas pa' poder volar
Y a quién no le falta el aliento en este aposento de frivolidades
Hay que estar atento, pa' no pasarse de ingenuidades

[Pre-Coro]
¿Quién le dijo que él y yo éramos rivales?
Más bien amantes, correteamos por los valles, incesantes
Creímos ser como la encina y el roble
Permanecer unidos nos haría inmortales
Y así vivir un amor de eternidades
Y así vivir nuestro amor de eternidades

[Coro]
No quisiera desaparecer
Antes de mojarme otra vez
Los pies en la luna
No quisiera desaparecer
Antes de mojarme otra vez
Los pies en la luna

[Verso 2]
Te creíste sabio sabiendo que lo lograrías
Había algo que no sabias, vía vía
Se te paso el tranvía
Otra vez estas luchando contra la deriva
Quisiera desenmascarar al enmascarado
Aquel que de su sed de haber el mundo conquistado
Se ha colocado una careta y no protesta
Patea a quien sea con tal de alcanzar su meta
Se me está haciendo difícil con usted interactuar
Trastabilla su lengüeta cada vez que intenta hablar

14063,Montreal,Dieter Spitz,"Wir stürzen ab
Ich hab's geahnt!
Mein Horoskop hat diese Woche doch vor Flugreisen gewarnt
Die Flügel brennen
Die Menschen schreien
Ein paar Sekunden noch, dann wird höchstens die Blackbox übrig sein

Das Chaos tobt
Im dichten rauch
Die Optimisten blasen schon mal ihre Rettungswesten auf
Ich sitz verkrampft
Und kreidebleich
An meinem Kopf fliegt scheinbar schlecht verstautes Handgepäck vorbei

Es wird stets gesagt, bevor's zu Ende geht
Sieht man sein Leben wie im Zeitraffer nochmal
Ich würde zwar viel lieber etwas Anderes sehen
Doch da hat man ja vermutlich keine Wahl

Ich frag mich, was wohl meine letzten Worte waren
Den genauen Wortlaut kann ich nur erahnen
Doch mit Sicherheit - wie sollt es anders sein
War Tomatensaft dabei

Where do you go when your glass end up empty
Oh, I wanna know, won't you let me know
Where do you hide when you leave me here wasting
Oh, I wanna know

We're only lovers when we count down
Tell me when to stop, tell me, tell me when to stop, babe
Just keep on dancing like we're nightbound
Lovers on the clock
I'll be ready when we go down

We spend the night on bubble-bliss
Forever lasting
I know you never would admit it
But I can see through you

Oh, I wanna know, won't you let me know
Where do you hide when you leave me here wasting
Oh, I wanna know

Why you gotta be so beautiful?
Making me afraid to fall in love
Why you gotta be so wonderful?
When I know we just can't happen
It's running through my head
The things I could've say
And now I'm trying to get you off my mind
So why you gotta be so beautiful?
Why you gotta be so beautiful?

Don't say ""No"", I'll make a scene
'Cause in my head we're meant to be
It's not a joke, just how I feel
I'll pinch your arm to show it's real
I would take that leap but I'm scared of heights
I'm in too deep to back out
So I hold my breath and I close my eyes
The time is never right, oh why

Why you gotta be so beautiful?
Making me afraid to fall in love

14091,Summer Love,Sole Sole,"Hook:

If she by her lonesome, ask her if she want some, Come get some of this ""Summer Love""

Look her in her eyes, and just pull her to the side and you just tell her this

Verse 1:

I seen you walking by yourself just the other day, didn't approach you cause I couldn't think of words to say

Let me be the person that put a smile on your face, and if anybody try you Im breaking they face

Hold your hand while Im walking with you on the streets, a'int gotta play no games with me this can be for keeps

Can have a kid that one day me and you we can teach, have a lot of dinner dates pick a place to eat

You should wear some heels, you should show you're thighs, we can be together till the end of our lives

Might have some bad days, but mostly good days, she vibe to my music, yeah, she could stay

Bringing flowers to your job, to make you happy isn't hard, got you now I'm thanking God, know you'll never play the guy

Don't let one of these dudes throw a ring on you then you're trapped, its not about the gift itself but really how the gift is wrapped

Hook:

If she by her lonesome, ask her if she want some, Come get some of this ""Summer Love""

Look her in her eyes, and just pull her to the side and you just tell her this


Verse 2 :

I'll fall back if you feel bugged but this it could be real love, a year from now we'll still hug, not nervous if I mean mug

Wait on you while you get you're nails done, I a'int got a problem, one day ima get you Gucci, one day ima get you Prada

Hold it down while Im on the road chasing cash, ill never let you go cause you know this gone last

You can have my back, while Im writing in the lab, can be smiling when you see me getting closer than you laugh

After that, we relax, cause in time you get attacked, who would have thought we'd be a match, no funny ways you gone act

Don't like no there dudes be cause she knowing that they wack, you don't want to waste you're time but mostly give them the ass

But when you give it to me you knowing that Im gone grab, when you ask me am I ready I say ""You don't know the half""

Giving you summer love after that you gone be glad, replaying it in your mind of loving that you just had


Hook:

If she by her lonesome, ask her if she want some, Come get some of this ""Summer Love""

Look her in her eyes, and just pull her to the side and you just tell her this

The only rules were the ones we made
So reckless and not thinking straight
But we didn't care

Singing ey-oh, we are the wild ones
Living life 'cause you're only a child once
Nothing's gonna come between us
Nothing's gonna come between us

14144,Con Mi Amiga,Daniela Darcourt,"[Letra de ""Con Mi Amiga""]

[Verso 1]
Pásame tu celular, estás nervioso, ya lo sé
Dices que no ocultas nada
Permíteme, entonces ver
Quita esa cara de idiota
Ya entiendo por qué no querías
Acabo de ver la prueba
Que estás con alguien escondidas
Ya no aguanto más mentiras
No soporto esta agonía
Y lárguese, lárguese de mi vida

[Coro]
Que te vayas con ella
Ya no niegues las cosas que yo he visto
Esta traición no la resisto
Y ahora soy yo la que te pido
Que te vayas con ella
Pero lárguese lejos de mi vida
Que siento asco si me miras
Y tu presencia me lastima
Y una pregunta yo le tengo
Que una cosa que me intriga
Por qué de todas las mujeres
Tú me engañaste con mi amiga

[Verso 2]
Solo deseo que algún día
El karma se le apareciera
Y todo lo que me has hecho
Te lo hagan de igual manera
Con negarlo no haces nada
No es eterna una mentira
Acabo de ver la prueba
Que estás con alguien escondida
Ya no aguanto más mentiras
No soporto esta agonía
Y lárguese, lárguese de mi vida

[Coro]
Que te vayas con ella
Ya no niegues las cosas que yo he visto
A esta traición no la resisto
Y ahora soy yo la que te pido
Que te vayas con ella
Pero lárguese lejos de mi vida
Que siento asco si me miras
Y tu presencia me lastima
Y una pregunta yo le tengo
Una cosa que me intriga
Por qué de todas las mujeres
Tú me engañaste con mi amiga

[Puente ]
Daniela Darcourt, esa soy yo
¡Súbelo Mate!
Oílo
Yeeeeeieh

[Coro]
Que te vayas con ella
Ya no niegues las cosas que yo he visto
A esta traición no la resisto
Y ahora soy yo la que te pido
Que te vayas con ella
Pero lárguese lejos de mi vida
Que siento asco si me miras
Y tu presencia me lastima
Y una pregunta yo le tengo
Una cosa que me intriga
Por qué de todas las mujeres
Tú me engañaste con mi amiga
Con mi amiga
Te quiero lejos de mi vida

[Verse 1: Maxi & Agus]
Nena, yo no sé con quién
No me importa ni quiero saber
Tranquila que yo estoy muy bien
Pero mejor si no te vuelvo a ver

Yo sé que solo es cuestión de tiempo
Mientras tanto de rumba me iré
Verás como la paso bien
Sin ti yo me la paso bien

[Chorus: Maxi & Agus]
Te olvidaré
Tú fuiste la que me falló primero
Y ahora me va mejor así soltero
Buscando amores pero pasajeros

Te olvidaré (olvidaré)
Porque tú del amor no sabes nada
Me voy con una amiga pa' la playa
Será sobre la arena o bajo el agua

[Verse 2: Pedro Capó]
Ahora que estoy soltero, mamá
Hago lo que quiero cuando quiero na' ma'
Humildemente tengo que decirte
No sabés de lo que te perdiste
Yo vivo gozando y tú estás triste

Yo tiro el anzuelo
Todo lo que pique caramelo
Tú a mí ya no me haces falta
Suelto, dejo que te vayas
Cierro puerta, me voy pa' la playa

[Chorus: Maxi & Pedro Capó]
Te olvidaré
Tú fuiste la que me falló primero
Y ahora me va mejor así soltero
Buscando amores pero pasajeros

Te olvidaré
Porque tú del amor no sabes nada
Me voy con una amiga pa' la playa
Será sobre la arena o bajo el agua

[Verse 3: Agus, Maxi & Pedro Capó]
Todo será bajo del sol y a plena vista
Yo no soy como tú que te besabas a escondidas
Me muevo como una palmera con la brisa
Y ella que me baila, ay, que rica esta vida

Yo sé que solo es cuestión de tiempo
Mientras tanto de rumba me iré
Verás como la paso bien
Sin ti me la paso bien

[Chorus: Maxi & Agus]
Te olvidaré
Tú fuiste la que me falló primero
Y ahora me va mejor así soltero
Buscando amores pero pasajeros

Te olvidaré (te olvidaré)
Porque tú del amor no sabes nada
Me voy con una amiga pa' la playa
Será sobre la arena o bajo el agua

[Fade Out: Maxi & Agus]
Lejos, te quiero lejos
Mejor no verte y tenerte bien lejos
Lejos, te quiero lejos
Vete y no intentes buscarme de nuevo
Solito me quedo

She's praying to a God that won't talk back

Keeps praying to a God that won't talk back
Won't talk back
Down on her knees here
Praying to a God that won't talk back (Hey)

Her momma believed that the devil had a dress on
So she's out on the town, tonight she got her best on
Her daddy believed that the needle was a highway
So she powders her nose, she's just looking for the right shade

[Pre-Chorus]
It gets hard to feel the friction underwater
And she's breaking down, tearing at the borders
In too deep to save herself
She takes a pill, it seems to help
Close her eyes and pictures standing at the altar

She's praying to a God that won't talk back

14149,Píntame,Gabriel,"En el bolsillo derecho de mi impermeable naranja
Guardo un universo en el que todo va hacia atrás
Allí doblaré una esquina diferente y
Como dice la canción, no nos conoceremos jamás

Cuando miro una tormenta pienso en carnotauros
Pintame un cielo mandarina con nubes de nácar
Dejemos Agosto debajo de una piedra
Si no viste la flor antes de marchitarse
No digas conocerla

Es siempre así, es siempre así
El taladro en la cabeza y soñar es resistir
Es siempre así, es siempre así
Un taladro en la cabeza. Soñar es existir

Y si al otro lado del agua quieta y clara
Hay otra igual también sentada en la silla más fía del jardín
Si vas a vivir un solo día ojalá que salga el sol
Y que huela a jazmín

Es siempre así, es siempre así
El taladro en la cabeza y soñar es existir
Es siempre así, es siempre así
Un taladro en la cabeza. Soñar no es mentir

No me dejes morir por mucho tiempo
Plantame en el lugar al que las aves vuelan en invierno
Para no llorar

Gira y gira sin cesar como un espiral en un espiral…

La distancia no sabe lo que es la distancia no sabe lo que
La distancia no sabe lo que es la distancia no sabe lo que es la distancia
No sabe lo que es…

La distancia no sabe lo que es la distancia no sabe que lo es

Never let my sisters out the spot but they let me
Eleven years old grindin' rocks, wallahi
With my lil' ahks DeMarco and Sean G
Now when I see my lil' niggas shine it remind me
Of the times could've died sellin' crumbs to zombies
Lil' kids on outside but look how times changed
Used to sell rocks to get fly now niggas rob friends
Pops locked, moms can't get by we barely had things
But the love in our heart gave me drive now we got everything
Told me, ""Jack please go to school,"" but I would rather sing
And would my music go all over the world but that was just a dream

[Chorus: The Jacka]
I knocked a nigga off today
Maybe I should walk away
Remember when you talk to me
I could take your life away
I knocked a nigga off today
Maybe I should walk away
Remember how you talk to me

Get that work on our arms some Big Willie favor
Buy a suite in the Seasons with big willy niggas

You really love your girl but really she was my hoe before

You better duck cause nigga here come ninety-nine more
You probably got fucked if you fucked over me before
Them choppers buck and leave blood on the dance floor
Be true to this game and the game will be true to you
Fuck a vest all [?] what we usually do

Y te vi llegar, no pude evitar preguntarte
Pude notar en tus ojos tristes que lloraste, lloraste, lloraste
¿Te maltrató, dime qué te hizo ese cobarde?
Su mamá no le enseñó que eso a una mujer no se le hace
No se hace, no se hace (No, no, no, no, no)

Y tú aquí en mi cama (Aaah)

Yo soy una dama (Sí)
Hicimos justicia porque en el amor el que la hace la paga (Ay)

O que salga de ella y que la venda

Él no sabe que ella tiene suplente
Es que hace tiempo nadie me pone caliente (Uy)
Que me mate con flores y no con golpes

Getting into trouble

Unpredictable
So original
You're never backing down, backing down, backing down

So dangerous

When I’m with you
I go all in
To lose or win

Moving like a hurricane
There will come a time for when
We can wash away our sins
Settle down but until then
We're like a hurricane

You're so different
Kind of ignorant
You don't care what people say, people say, people say
I'm going crazy
For you baby
Don't know how you're making me, feel this way, what can I say

Just take a hand, you got a free pass

Tried to hide it, but you had me from the get-go
Let me be frank, I'm not that complicated
If you need me, there's no use in playing games no
There’s no denying what we've got

[Chorus: Vicki Vox]
Just watch me break in your sweat
You're falling into me
Touch me, I swear
You'll do anything that I want
So keep us awake till the dawn

14139,Cristina,Maffio,"Eu fui ver a minha amada
Lá prós baixos dum jardim
Dei-lhe uma rosa encarnada
Para se lembrar de mim

Eu fui ver o meu benzinho
Lá prós lados dum passal
Dei-lhe o meu lenço de linho
Que é do mais fino bragal

Eu fui ver uma donzela
Numa barquinha a dormir
Dei-lhe uma colcha de seda
Para nela se cobrir

Eu fui ver uma solteira
Numa salinha a fiar
Dei-lhe uma rosa vermelha
Para de mim se encantar

Eu fui ver a minha amada
Lá nos campos eu fui ver
Dei-lhe uma rosa encarnada
Para de mim se prender

Verdes prados, verdes campos
Onde está minha paixão
As andorinhas não param
Umas voltam outras não

Minha mãe quando eu morrer
Ai chore por quem muito amargou
Para então dizer ao mundo
Ai Deus mo deu Ai Deus mo levou

14119,Missed Call,Hogland,"[Verse 1]
I know you're coming back for everything that we had
You're so unpredictable with the way that you act
I'll show you all the reasons why we didn't last
And now it's time to fake the blame

Our story ends with me feeling so alone
There's no way you coming back, please just let me go
And I picked you up but you push me to my knees
Now I'm strugglin' to breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Your missed call is another sign to me
That you never had to leave
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can see all the days we didn't meet
You won't own me so I let you go
Oh no, oh no

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Your heart's jinxed, played the melodies to keep my head
They hold me like the shadows underneath my bed
You got me lost inside your everchanging maze
Now it's too late to escape

I can't be wasting time, playing silly games
Control it with your lies that i dont wanna say
And I got back up, now I'm stood on my two feet
So it's time for you to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Your missed call is another sign to me
That you never had to leave
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can see all the days we didn't meet
You won't own me so I let you go

That you never had to leave
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can see all the days we didn't meet
You won't own me so I let you go
Oh no, oh no

Nothing stayed the same

There's so much more in between us
Tell me if I’m dreaming
Are we the lucky ones?
Are we the lucky ones?

Went from quitter to winner
No, I never gon' leave her
Love the fact that I've been so wrong
Now I know she's a keeper

In the shell the water's fine
Don't wanna leave the old behind
If it's not now, give it time
Everybody has to cross the line
Thoughts and prayers are not enough
It's battle scars that make us tough
Bend the wood and build the ships
Say farewell with a widow's kiss

Come with me, darling
Let's go down the secret road
Where the unknown is all we know
Lay with me, darling
Let's sleep beneath another sky
Where every story we've told

A promise made, but will it keep
When the cold keeps us from sleep?
When the untouched is in our reach
Will the water still taste as sweet?

Hacerme el tonto, ¿para qué?
Si a mí no me importa nada
Prefiero vivir y perder que no haber vivido nada
Si te vas, quedaré en un dolor que jamás conocí

Sin brújula, sin dirección, pisado y sediento
Lo mismo que amar un humano sin alma en el cuerpo

Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)

Lo que tiene esa mujer
Que no se aferra a nada
Si la vienes a convencer
Te hace tragar esas palabras

Ella no cree en los falsos amores
Ni que traten de conquistarla
Mucho menos que le lleven flores
Que por ahora no se casa..

Dice que no quiere nada ah ah
Que ella quiere estar sola ah ah
Que no le prometan nada ah ah
Por que ella no se ilusiona ah ah

Dice que no quiere nada ah ah
Que ella quiere estar sola ah ah
Que no le prometan nada ah ah
Por que ella no se ilusiona ah ah..

Ella decide a quien
Le da sus besos le entrega su cuerpo
Ella no quiere más enamorarse
Que no le vengan con el mismo cuento

Ella sale en la noche
Solo piensa en pasar bien
No quiere estar con alguien
Que le diga lo que tiene que hacer..

Dice que no quiere nada ah ah
Que ella quiere estar sola ah ah
Que no le prometan nada ah ah
Por que ella no se ilusiona ah ah

Dice que no quiere nada ah ah

Straight up, I think you’re scared to love
I said it
Oh, and that’s why you’re backing out
Last night I know was dangerous
I get it
Because both of our guards were down

If we were like two kids
Caught with a lighter, after starting a fire
But baby, why all this?
There’s no point in fighting
There’s no point in fighting when

I know you feel for me what I feel for you
I know you felt the heat when I was holding you
But how we supposed to burn, like them lovers do
If you keep, you keep, you keep acting all fireproof

No lie, this is the realest thing
I mean it
Maybe that’s why you’re lying up
Wishing right now you were here with me
Under blankets
'Cause I’m the only one who lights you up

We could be like two kids
Catching on fire, using lips as our lighters
So baby, why all this?

My serenity when the drama starts
Permanent president of my heart
Baby, baby, you are

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Me quedaré contigo
Voy a robarle todas las flechas a cupido
Y te daré mi corazón con un motivo
Que solo por tu amor
Yo sigo vivo (Yo sigo vivo)
Yo sigo vivo

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I live a life that movies are made of
But nothin’ 'bout me is Hollywood
Baby, you know how we roll
Baby, you know what they do
Baby, you know how it goes
Cojelo con take it easy
Baby, let's take it slow

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Mi amor, mi vida es complicada
La fama
El poder
Dinero
Mujeres
El chisme
El alcohol
La hierba
Pero yo sigo enfocado
El león de la selva

[Verse 3: Pitbull & Ne-Yo]
Gracias a ti (Thank you)
Por tu apoyo (Thank you)
Por tu amor, thank you for staying loyal
Yo te lo doy todo
Hasta la vida que yo vivo
Para quedarme contigo

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Me quedaré contigo
Voy a robarle todas las flechas a cupido
Y te daré mi corazón con un motivo
Que solo por tu amor
Yo sigo vivo (Yo sigo vivo)
(Yo sigo vivo) Yo sigo vivo

[Verse 4: El Micha]
Me quedaré contigo porque contigo estoy vivo
Porque tengo mis motivos si, pa’ quedarme fijo
Contigo quiero el anillo
Contigo quiero los hijos
Los momentos que vivimos ni borrando los olvido
Yo lo único que pido es que siempre duermas conmigo
Y que en los momentos de frío, seas mi mejor abrigo
Yo nunca me quitaré aunque me celes y me pelees
Y aunque te hablen mal de mi yo te pido que no me dejes, si yo
Soy jardinero y te cuido como una flor
No soy perfecto y contigo soy el mejor
No me dejes solo sin tus besos por favor
Porque yo

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Me quedaré contigo
Voy a robarle todas las flechas a cupido
Y te daré mi corazón con un motivo
Que solo por tu amor
Yo sigo vivo (Yo sigo vivo)

[Verso 5: Lenier]
Si me dieran a escoger
No sabría qué decir
Pero ojalá que seas tu
Ay, solamente tu
La que siempre está ahí cuando más necesito
La que me regala momentos bonitos
Me esta robando toda la confianza, poquito a poquito

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Me quedaré contigo
Voy a robarle todas las flechas a cupido
Y te daré mi corazón con un motivo
Que solo por tu amor
Yo sigo vivo
(Yo sigo vivo) Yo sigo vivo

I swear to God, when I come home
I'm gonna hold you so close
I swear to God, when I come home, I'll never let go
Like a river, I flow to the ocean I know
You pull me close, guiding me home

[Chorus]
And I need you to know that we're
Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words
With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, we're fallin' in love

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, I can see
Four kids and no sleep
We'll have one on each knee, you and me, hmm
And when they've grown up
You're still the girl in the club
When I held your hair up, 'cause you had too much

[Chorus]
And I need you to know that we're
Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words
With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love

I swear to God, every day
He won't take you away
'Cause without you, babe, I lose my way

Lo siento pero antes de enamorado

[Verso 1]
Lembra das chaves do nosso apartamento
O dia em que você me pediu em casamento
Depois fugiu e nunca voltou
Quantas vezes me silenciou
Os amigos me avisavam que você não presta
Mas prum apaixonado só o que interessa
É viver esse amor
Foi falso enquanto durou

[Pré-Refrão]
E agora você vai se sentir tão pequeno
E agora vai provar do próprio veneno
Seu feitiço agora acabou
Ficou claro quando um novo amor rolou

[Refrão]
Chora, chora
Agora chora, chora
Seu feitiço virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

[Verso 2]
Fiquei sabendo que anda pelos cantos
Sofrendo e lamentando porque perdeu tanto
As vantagens que aproveitou
A amizade que renegou
E agora ainda quer que eu me compadeça
Depois que fodeu toda a inocência
Encontrei meu auto-amor
Seu controle agora acabou

[Refrão]
Chora, chora
Filha da puta, agora chora, chora
Seu feitiço virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

[Verso 3]
Os boletos que não pagou
Quantas vezes me silenciou
E ainda veio achando que ia sair por cima
Comigo não
As contas que deixou pra trás
Vou mandar pra casa dos seus pais
E essa foi a última vez que me levantou a mão
Comigo não (Comigo não, comigo não)

[Refrão]
Chora, chora
Filha da puta, agora chora, chora
Seu feitiço virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

Com o teu lado tão descolado
Às vezes muito pouco arrumado
Teu black, teu cacho, teu crespo, teu afro
Ondula, ondulado, enrolado
E em seus cachos será que me encaixo?
Em seu peito tem pra mim um espaço
Se enrosca no meu que eu me enrosco no teu
Se amarra no meu que me amarro no teu

[Verso 1: Farruko]
(¡Farru!)
Me recuerda los domingo' en el bote en Palomino
'Cuchando a Daddy Yankee pa' los tiempo' 'e Barrio Fino
Bebiendo gasolina, bajando pa' Carolina
Con el bate encendi'o y no soy Yadier Molina
Tú me recuerda' mucho, bebé, a mi islita
A Barrio Obrero, Santurce y Playita
Le gusta el calentón y no se deja la galla
Si tú fuera' boricua tú sería' de Baya'

Que por ahí andamo' a fuego y hoy a casa no llego
Vámono' (Vámono', vámono')
De chinchorreo pa'l campo, en el Banshee wheelieando

Ella loquita, yo loco con ella, bailando no me despego, oh

[Verso 2: Lennox]
Ay, cintura caribeña, bella trigueña
Se menea como toda borinqueña
Es una guerrillera, nada le asusta
Ella tiene todo lo que a mí me gusta (Mamaci-)
Con ella voy pa'l campo, Monte Adentro
Exploramos todo sin perder el tiempo
Te canto al oído con mi flow violento
Tenemos el gorrito y nos quemamo' lento

[Verso 3: Pedro Capó]
Mansa-mansita como la Bahía
Conmigo a to'a ella siempre se va
Es un tesoro, mi perla escondi'a
La vi bailando en el viejo San Juan
En una fiesta de San Sebastián
Prendi'a como un flamboyán
La reina de toda La Plaza
La santa de mi catedral

[Pre-Coro: Justin Quiles]
Los ojo' azule' como el horizonte
Un trajecito verde monte
La llevo a Aguadilla, enrolamo' en Aponte
Conoció mis raíces de adolescente
A ella le gusta el barrio y a mí también
Le gusta lo sencillo y a mí también
Le gusta estar elevada y a mí también
A mí también, a mí también

Me recuerda a mi borinquen bella, bella, ella

14184,Oasis,Potyguara Bardo,"[Verso 1]
Agora vai! Em pleno deserto
A tempestade de areia lhe trouxe pra mais perto
Agora vem a mim semelhante
Também jovem nesse jogo, mas já tão bem amante
Agora VDC, já deu certo!
Pois já desejei a um gênio e cruzei o dedo aberto
Agora vai ter festa na floresta
Mais de um milhão de bardos juntos pr'essa seresta

[Pre-Refrão 1]
Lhe ofereço algo pra beber
Cê bebe tudo sem uma gota escorrer
Se sonhei ou se eu tô sonhando
Eu não sei, só sei que eu tô gostando
E o coração sambando a palpitar
Nós valsando ao som daquela da Vittar
Me toquei que tava alucinando
Um oásis com a gente lá morando

[Refrão 1]
Mas eu sei que você não me quer
Me afobei quando meu beijo retribuiu
Não faz mal, benzinho não vou lhe incomodar
Mil e uma rejeições já precisei encarar
Mas eu sei que você não me quer
Me afobei quando meu beijo retribuiu
Outro igual, desculpe não vai encontrar
No varal do oásis eu estendo amor para dar

[Pós-Refrão]
Para dar paparadara, para dar, paparadara
Paparadara, paparadara, paparadara

[Verso 2]
Agora vai! Agora já passou
Eu fiquei meio ariada, é que a rede balançou
Agora chega desse mau agouro
Que eu não sou mais um bezerro e lustro bem os meus touros
Agora vai! Minha letra mudou
Mamma Mia! Ka-karamba! Eu quero um flop novo
Agora vou ouvir meu coração
Quiçá dessa batida sai um outro refrão

[Pre-Refrão 2]
Lhe ofereci água pra beber
Fez cara feia e se danou a correr
Se sonhei, ouvi quando acordando
No deserto, seu nome ecoando
'Cê tem noção que consegue me afetar
Mais do que a situação da política brasileira?
Me passei, tô sempre alucinando
Vou fugir, ser um monge tibetano

[Refrão 2]
Pois eu sei que você não me quer
Me afobei quando meu beijo retribuiu
Não faz mal, benzinho não vou lhe incomodar
Mil e uma rejeições já precisei encarar
Tudo bem que você não me quer por aqui
Me afobei quando meu beijo retribuiu
Não faz mal, benzinho não vou lhe incomodar
O ideal é aprender a me preservar
Pois eu sei, por mim devo ter mais respeito
Já notei, minha saúde vale mais que um beijo
Outro igual, desculpe não vai encontrar
No varal do deserto eu ainda estendo amor para dar

[Pós-Refrão]
Para dar paparadara, para dar, paparadara
Paparadara, paparadara, paparadara
Para dar, paparadara
Para dar, paparadara
Para dar, paparadara
Paradise, paparadara
Para dar, paparadara
Para dar, paparadara, paradise
Para dar, paparadara

Ver um filme no seu sofá

Dum dum, uh la la la la
Com as bênçãos de Buda
Cristal, vela e o caralho

Eso que tú hiciste conmigo
Yo no te lo perdono
Ahora tienes lo que te mereces
Tú te quedaste solo
Y no vengas a pedir perdón (Ah, ah)
Ahora lloras y te duele
Tú jugaste con mi corazón
Y con el de mil mujeres

[Coro: Fanny Lu]
Ahora sufre como yo sufrí, ahora llora como yo lloré
Aguanta calla'o, como yo aguanté
No me preguntes cómo hice, pero te olvidé
Ahora sufre como yo sufrí, ahora llora como yo lloré
Aguanta calla'o, como yo aguanté
No me preguntes cómo hice, pero te olvidé

[Post-Coro]
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
No me preguntes cómo hice, pero te olvidé (Fanny Lu, la nena)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
¡Okey!

[Verso 1: Farina]
Ya pasé la hoja, tus explicaciones son tan flojas
Guárdalas pa' la rubia, la negra y la pelirroja (Bye, bye)
Que de lo tuyo ya no se me antoja
Tengo a otro que hasta reinas sonroja
Loco, copiando por el privado, tú fuiste un malvado
Ahora mi sentimiento por ti está congelado
Lo quiero dulce, lo tuyo me sabe a salado
Mi amor por ti ha sido fusilado
Tú ya pasaste a la historia
Al final fui yo quien obtuvo la victoria
Ahora que estás lejos me siento en la gloria
¿Qué si soy feliz? La respuesta es notoria

[Pre-Coro: Fanny Lu, Farina]
De tus mentiras me cansé (¡Fanny!)
Y de tanta borrachera (¡Fanny Lu!)
Toda la noche de fiesta en la calle
Regalando besito' a cualquiera (Yuh)
Pero te olvidaste de mi sexto sentido
Tú te creíste un bandido (¡Wuh!)
Ay, mira que te dije no jugaras conmigo
Por eso estás de castigo

[Coro: Fanny Lu & Farina]
Ahora sufre como yo sufrí, ahora llora como yo lloré
Aguanta calla'o, como yo aguanté
No me preguntes cómo hice, pero te olvidé
Ahora sufre como yo sufrí, ahora llora como yo lloré
Aguanta calla'o, como yo aguanté
No me preguntes cómo hice, pero te olvidé

No me preguntes cómo hice, pero te olvidé

Yo no soy tu mamá, tú no te mereces esta dama
Te mereces a una de esas ba-baja gama
Ahora que estás solo como peluche en cama
Llorando porque esta reina ya no te llama
Mientras me llama, yo comprando en el mall
Mil mensajes diciéndome ""Por favor""
Verte sufrir para mí será un honor
Nene, esta vez no hay cura pa' ese dolor, no

[Coro: Fanny Lu & Farina]
Ahora sufre como yo sufrí, ahora llora como yo lloré
Aguanta calla'o, como yo aguanté

Tá linda a paisagem
Não dá mais pra esperar

Pra onda azul juntar
Somente o que for bom
O resto vai passar

No mergulho eu falei com Deus
Quando eu sair do mar
Vou me lembrar do dom
Que é poder respirar

He came to the rescue right when the Memphis met the sea
The tidal wave just broke the heart of mi arahuaca
So they sent him back where he was meant to be

De mi cibaeña se afició
¡Que rebú!

14187,Você Me Vira a Cabeça,Urias,"[Letra de ""Você Me Vira A Cabeça"" com Urias]

[Verso 1]
Você me vira a cabeça, me tira do sério
Destrói os planos que um dia eu fiz pra mim
Me faz pensar porque que a vida é assim
Eu sempre vou e volto pros teus braços

[Verso 2]
Você não me quer de verdade
No fundo eu sou sua vaidade
Eu vivo seguindo os teus passos
Eu sempre estou presa em teus laços
É só você chamar que eu vou

[Pré-Refrão]
(Por que você não vai embora de vez?)
(Por que não me liberta dessa paixão?)
Por que?
(Por que você não diz que não me quer mais?)
(Por que não deixa livre o meu coração?)

[Refrão]
Mas tem que me prender, tem que seduzir
Só pra me deixar louca por você
Só pra ter alguém que vive sempre ao seu dispor
Por um segundo de amor
Mas tem que me prender, tem que seduzir
Só pra me deixar louca por você
Só pra ter alguém que vive sempre ao seu dispor
Por um segundo de amor

Estaba muy adentro escondida

Dame una sonrisa y me desarmas
Si siento que me estoy perdiendo
Es solo que me temo que al fin encuentro

Llévame, tú llévame, y llévame volando en un beso
Llévame, si estás tú

Tu amor es como un río
Que en cada beso vuelve y me baña
Es como una corriente que arrastra
Con solo verte ahí en la puerta de casa
Tu amor es como un río
Que da tanto que se me desborda
Y a veces aunque nade en su contra
Desisto y tan solo me dejo así llevar

[Verso 3]
Tienes mil excusas para olvidarme
Y si siento que te estoy perdiendo
Te doy cien mil razones para quedarte

Desisto y tan solo me dejo así llevar

Que en cada beso vuelve y me baña

Desisto y tan solo me dejo así llevar

Y ahora e' que la cosa se va a poner buena aquí
Gozadera total, pa' lante
Hagan bulla, aquí el party
Move your body, everybody
La gente mía, latino' el mundo
En alegría vamo' juntos
A la montaña de mi patria
Dominicana, el acordeón
Tocando fuerte, bien de cierto
Y quiero verte, chocando cuerpo
Mojando la ropa, así se goza
Moviendo la cosa maravillosa
Con mucho swing 'del latin'
Calientita como el ají (?)
Quisqueyana que buena baila usted
Da la vuelta mami otra vez
Llegó el negro de la joya
Fulano de tal, gozadera total

Swing, Swing swing... (de fondo)
Vamo' a gozar, vamo' a bailar la fiesta esta buena, yo me vo' a quedar

Sigue sigue (reach out) goza goza, gozadera total

En el mil cuatrocientos noventa y dos
Llegó un tipo que dijo que descubrió
La Quisqueya mía, Ave María
Get out of here con eso
Taíno indio caribeño
Él fue que le enseñó a su pueblo
Él fue que compuso su ritmo
Merengueao ripeao pa' su hijo
Levante la mano ???
Bulla hasta el amanecer
Corriente, con mucha corriente
Desorden forma de repente
Aguardiente, Brugal, Presidente
Barceló es lo que bebe la gente
Bailando el weekend gozando
Totalmente, sigan acabando

Ahora, a parrandear. Ahora vamo' a gozar
Con el meneíto moviendo el ombliguito
Las mujeres hembras que tiemblan
Oye mami no te lo pierdas
Es el meneíto moviendo el ombliguito
Con ganas

Francamente yo soy teniente
No puedes verme con par de lentes
Chequea el estilo pegando siempre
Como un martillo saben, aprende de este chin como se hace con mucho swing
Sin pararse la noche entera, sin barreras a tu manera
Haz lo que quieras cántele un coro
Con tu cuerpo mami, tienes tu el derecho, mira que hay bastante nena
No tenga' pena pecho a pecho, lao a lao magia latina, lao a lao
Cepilla cepilla guallalo bien, dejalo en brillo
Gozadera total e' lo que brindo

Gozadera total!!

Con bulla, hagan una bulla, hagan una bulla por ahi pasó, por ahi pasó
Mira donde va, mira donde va, vámono' con el , vámono' con el
Arranca, arranca....., bien la arrancó

14163,Don Juan & Cupido,Henry Santos,"ANTHONY: Oh My God!

HENRY: Te pronuncias “el rey,” de la utopía emperador...
El niñito con alas que se cree Dios del amor...
¿Adónde está “Cupida”? La mujer de tu vida?
Un angelito solo, en propagandas con flechitas, sin amor...

ANTHONY: Es que no te das cuenta por machista y charlatán
Que el amor se te aleja mientras privas en “Don Juan”
Eres caso perdido, la verdad, te lo digo
No hay un caso más tonto que aquel  tonto que no se deja ayudar...

HENRY: Promesas, promesas, ¿Porqué no te confiesas? que le vendiste sueños a mis sueños, impostor!

ANTHONY: Das pena y tristeza, porque es que no contemplas las claras peticiones que te exige el corazón!

HENRY: Y deja de venderme sueños con tu paraíso de “un amor real”

ANTHONY: Deja de vender mentiras mi Don Juan vencido con doble moral

HENRY: Por ti hay tantas almas rotas siempre te equivocas, y el amor murió

ANTHONY: Tomas decisiones locas y al final de cuentas el malo soy yo!

Pupilo, hágale caso a su Mayimbe

Es que usted no era así cuando lo conocí, (risas)
Digo yo…

Mira, mira…Ay siiiii

Anthony Santos

(Risas)

HENRY: ya he tirado la toalla en estas cosas del amor
Y hoy curo mis heridas con bachaticas y alcohol
Harakiri o espada, pa’ tu cuento de hadas
Soy el protagonista en otra historia donde cupido falló

ANTHONY: Es que no hay relación que se te pueda prometer
Si no ves diferencia entre estabilidad y placer
Tómelo con orgullo y póngase pa lo suyo
Ya está bueno de hacerte el ciego tonto, cuando es que no quieres ver!

HENRY: Promesas, promesas, ¿porqué no te confiesas? Que le vendiste sueños a mis sueños, impostor!

ANTHONY: Das pena y tristeza, porque es que no contemplas las claras peticiones que te exige el corazón!

HENRY: Y deja de venderme sueños con tu paraíso de “un amor real”

ANTHONY: Deja de vender mentiras mi Don Juan vencido con doble moral

HENRY: Por ti hay tantas almas rotas siempre te equivocas, y el amor murió

ANTHONY: Tomas decisiones locas y al final de cuentas el malo soy yo!

CORO (Henry)  it’s not fair

ANTHONY: Me encanta esa vaina!… Pero qué chulo, qué Chevere!
HENRY: uh hmmm, HENRY!
ANTHONY: Ay, qué envidia!
HENRY: (Risas) Qué bochinche!

14179,Oração,Linn da Quebrada,"[Introdução]
Eu determino que termine aqui e agora
Eu determino que termine em mim, mas não acabe comigo
Determino que termine em nós e desate
E que amanhã, amanhã possa ser diferente com elas
Que tenha outros problemas e encontre novas soluções
E que eu possa viver nelas, através delas, em suas memórias

[Verso 1]
Entre a oração e a ereção
Ora são, ora não são
Unção, bênção
Sem nação
Mesmo que não nasçam
Mas vivem e vivem e vem
Entre a oração e a ereção
Ora são, ora não são
Unção, bênção
Sem nação
Mesmo que não nasçam
Mas vivem e vivem e vem

Se homens se amam
Ciúmes, se hímen, se unem
A quem costumeiramente ama, a mente ama também
A mente ama também
A mente ama também

Pa' el que se sienta triste
Yo traigo la receta
Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas
Pa' el que se sienta triste
Yo traigo la receta
Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas
(¡Eeeh!)

[Verso 1: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa]
Apaga las noticias, sal pa' la calle y que te dé el sol
Cambia las corta venas, sube la radio en esta canción
No pierdas la esperanza cuando el conteo esté en tres y dos
Hazle swing pa' botarla aunque no siempre salga un homerun

[Puente: Gilberto Santa Rosa, Victor Manuelle, Juntos, (Cheo Quiñonez & Pichie Perez)]
(Buscale la salida a ese rompecabezas)
Y en esta vida, cada problema, bailando salsa se arregla

[Coro: Cheo Quiñonez & Pichie Perez, Victor Manuelle]
Pa' el que se sienta triste
Yo traigo la receta
Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas
(Tú no te quedes afuera)
Pa' el que se sienta triste
Yo traigo la receta
Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas
(Díselo Gilberto)

[Verso 2: Gilberto Santa Rosa, Victor Manuelle]
Yo me curo con rumbas si tengo alguna preocupación, (es la cosa)
Tres golpes de campana, dos cucharadas de guaguancó
Por eso hay que vencer el miedo cuando se aprieta la situación
La bola está en tu cancha para que sigas tu corazón

[Puente: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Juntos, (Cheo Quiñonez & Pichie Perez)]
(Buscale la salida a ese rompecabezas)
Y en esta vida, cada problema, bailando salsa se arregla

[Verso 3: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa, (Cheo Quiñonez & Pichie Perez)]
Yo traigo la medicina que te alivia los problemas
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
No hay mal que dure cien años
Ni cuerpo que lo resista cuando la música suena
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
Recuerda que las penas se van cantando
Olvida tu dolor y vive celebrando
Ay, que lo bueno te llega
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
Sí, la receta tú la sabes
Los discos de Rubén Blades, de Rosario, La Ponceña
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
Salsa, salsa yo te traigo
La misma que estoy cantando
La que corre por mis venas
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
Johnny me gusta, me gusta
Tú sabes que me gusta, me gusta la romántica
Me gusta la clásica y la nueva
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
¡Eeeh!
¡Caminen otra vez!

[Skit: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa, (Cheo Quiñonez & Pichie Perez)]
Oye, a todo el mundo
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
Por eso es que Tito y Tamara siempre están contentos
Claro Gilberto, si el que baila salsa no sufre
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
¡Eso!
¡Canta!, ¡canta!, ¡canta!
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)
(Salsa, salsa pa' olvidar las penas)

[Verso 4: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa]
Venimos de Tito Puentes, Celia Cruz, Héctor Lavoe
Tito Rodríguez, Panchito, donde todo comenzó
Ya su labor está hecha, con talento y emoción
Ya sí le abrieron la brecha a la nueva generación
El Gran Combo, La Ponceña, y también La Matancera
La Fania, Cheo Feliciano, y el gran Ismael Rivera
A todos los saludamos, a todos los recordamos
También los homenajeamos, ¡Víctor!, con la salsa que tocamos

[Outro: Victor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa, (Cheo Quiñonez & Pichie Perez)]
Gilberto, y a todos los salseros que se nos quedaron
Muchas gracias por su aportación
¡Eeeh!

(Yo te traigo mi salsa)
La que yo llevo en el alma
(Para olvidar las penas)
Oye, oye, tú no te quedes afuera
(Yo te traigo mi salsa)
La que se baila y se canta
(Para olvidar las penas)
La que cambia los problemas por la gozadera
(¡Salsa!)
Muévete al ritmo de un son
(¡Salsa!)
De una rumba o una plena
(¡Salsa!)
Deja afuera ese dolor, aquello que te condena
(¡Salsa!)
Y yo sé que la cosa está dura
(¡Salsa!)
La [?], la calle está tensa
(¡Salsa!)
No te pongas en depresión
(¡Pa' olvidar las penas!)
Vete a bailar en la acera
(¡Salsa!)
¡Eeeh!
¡Eeeh!
¡Eeeh!, ¡Salsa!

14177,AmarElo,Emicida,"[Letra de ""AmarElo"" com Emicida, Majur & Pabllo Vittar]

[Intro: Belchior]
Presentemente eu posso me considerar um sujeito de sorte
Porque apesar de muito moço, me sinto são e salvo e forte
E tenho comigo pensado: Deus é brasileiro e anda do meu lado
E assim já não posso sofrer no ano passado

[Refrão: Belchior]
Tenho sangrado demais, tenho chorado pra cachorro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro
Tenho sangrado demais, tenho chorado pra cachorro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro

[Verso 1: Emicida]
Eu sonho mais alto que drones
Combustível do meu tipo? A fome
Pra arregaçar como um ciclone (Entendeu?)
Pra que amanhã não seja só um ontem com um novo nome
O abutre ronda, ansioso pela queda (Sem sorte)
Findo mágoa, mano, sou mais que essa merda (Bem mais)
Corpo, mente, alma, um tipo Ayurveda
Estilo água, eu corro no meio das pedra
Na trama, tudo os drama turvo, eu sou um dramaturgo
Conclama a se afastar da lama, enquanto inflama o mundo
Sem melodrama, busco grana, isso é hosana em curso
Capulanas, catanas, buscar nirvana é o recurso
É um mundo cão pra nóiz, perder não é opção, certo?
De onde o vento faz a curva, brota o papo reto
Num deixo quieto, não tem como deixar quieto
A meta é deixar sem chão, quem riu de nós sem teto (Vai)

[Refrão: Majur, Emicida & Belchior]
Tenho sangrado demais (Aham)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (Eu preciso cuidar de mim)
Ano passado eu morri (Ei)
Mas esse ano eu não morro (Esse ano eu não morro)
Tenho sangrado demais (Demais)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (Aham)
Ano passado eu morri
Mas esse ano eu não morro (Belchior tinha razão)
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro (Ei, yeah)

[Verso 2: Emicida]
Figurinha premiada, brilho no escuro
Desde a quebrada avulso
De gorro, alto do morro e os camarada tudo
De peça no forro e os piores impulsos
Só eu e Deus sabe o que é num ter nada, ser expulso
Ponho linhas no mundo, mas já quis pôr no pulso
Sem o torro, nossa vida não vale a de um cachorro, triste
""Hoje Cedo"" não era um hit, era um pedido de socorro
Mano, rancor é igual um tumor, envenena a raiz
Onde a plateia só deseja ser feliz (Ser feliz)
Com uma presença aérea
Onde a última tendência é depressão com aparência de férias
Vovó diz: Odiar o diabo é mó boi (Mó boi)
Difícil é viver no inferno, e vem à tona
Que o memo império canalha que não te leva a sério
Interfere pra te levar à lona (Revide)

[Refrão: Majur, Emicida, Majur & Pabllo Vittar & Belchior]
Tenho sangrado demais (Aham)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (Aham, yeah, yeah)
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro (Ah, ah, ah)
Tenho sangrado demais (Demais)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (Tão precisando de mim)
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro

[Ponte: Pabllo Vittar, Emicida & Majur]
Permita que eu fale, não as minhas cicatrizes
Elas são coadjuvantes
Não, melhor, figurantes que nem devia tá aqui
Permita que eu fale, não as minhas cicatrizes
Tanta dor rouba nossa voz, sabe o que resta de nós?
Alvos passeando por aí
Permita que eu fale, não as minhas cicatrizes
Se isso é sobre vivência, me resumir à sobrevivência
É roubar o pouco de bom que eu vivi
Por fim, permita que eu fale, não as minhas cicatrizes
Achar que essas mazelas me definem é o pior dos crimes
É dar o troféu pro nosso algoz e fazer nóiz sumir

[Refrão: Pabllo Vittar, Emicida & Majur & Pabllo Vittar]
Tenho sangrado demais (Falei)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (É o meu sol que invade a cela)
Ano passado eu morri (Ei)
Mas esse ano eu não morro
Tenho sangrado demais (Demais)
Tenho chorado pra cachorro (Mais importante que nunca)
Ano passado eu morri (Mas aí?)
Mas esse ano eu não morro
Tenho sangrado demais, tenho chorado pra cachorro
(Tenho chorado demais, a rua é nóiz)
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro
Tenho sangrado demais, tenho chorado pra cachorro
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro

[Saída: Emicida, Pabllo Vittar & Majur]
(Laboratório Fantasma)
Aí, maloqueiro! Aí, maloqueira!
Levanta essa cabeça (Vem)
Enxuga essas lágrimas, certo? (É você memo)
Respira fundo e volta a correr (Vai)
'Cê vai sair dessa prisão (Aham)
'Cê vai atrás desse diploma com a fúria da beleza do sol, entendeu? (É isso)
Faz isso por nós, faz essa por nós (Vai)
Te vejo no pódio
Ano passado eu morri, mas esse ano eu não morro

O que vão dizer de nós
Seus pais, Deus e coisas tais

Baby, eu já cansei de me esconder
Entre olhares, sussurros com você

Teu corpo teso, duro, são
E o teu cheiro que ainda ficou

Um novo tempo há de vencer
Pra que a gente possa florescer
E, baby, amar, amar
Sem temer

Apaga a luz e deixa o tempo passar
Baby, você não perde por esperar
Apaga a luz, não há nada a temer
Apaga a luz quando é só eu e você
Apaga a luz
Apaga a luz

[Verso 1]
E olha nos olhos de quem diz que te quer
Diz que eu sou sua mulher
Te disse ontem que eu tô pronta pro que der e vier
Apaga essa luz agora (Ah-ah)
A chuva já cai lá fora (Ah)
Só cola o teu corpo no meu

[Pré-Refrão]
Qualquer lugar contigo (Ah-ah)
Eu faço de abrigo (Ah-ah)
Bem do jeitinho que a gente entende
É meu porto seguro (Ah-ah)
Tô te querendo, eu juro (Ah-ah)

Apaga a luz e deixa o tempo passar
Baby, você não perde por esperar
Apaga a luz, não há nada a temer
Apaga a luz quando é só eu e você
Apaga a luz

[Verso 2]
Vou te deixar à vontade
Larga tudo aí, vem me encontrar mais tarde
O cheiro da sua pele inebria, invade
É chama que até sem oxigênio se arde
Eu quero te falar tudo que eu mais quero
Quero a vida do seu lado e começar do zero
Se pudesse fazer mais, eu faria mais pra te ver bem mais que feliz, eu te juro sincero (oh yeah)
Então fica comigo, baby
Sabe, eu posso te amar pra sempre
Sei cada resposta pra cada pergunta que você faria um dia sobre pertencer
Olha só pro meu plano agora:
Te levo pra ver o mundo lá fora
Férias de verão em Bora-Bora
Ou até roubar um banco
Bora?

[Refrão]
Apaga a luz e deixa o tempo passar
Baby, você não perde por esperar
Apaga a luz, não há nada a temer
Apaga a luz quando é só eu e você
(Apaga a luz) e deixa o tempo passar
Baby, você não perde por esperar
(Apaga a luz), não há nada a temer
Apaga a luz quando é só eu e você

[Verso 1]
Lembra das chaves do nosso apartamento
O dia em que você me pediu em casamento
Depois fugiu e nunca voltou
Quantas vezes me silenciou
Os amigos me avisavam que você não presta
Mas prum apaixonado só o que interessa
É viver esse amor
Foi falso enquanto durou

[Pré-Refrão]
E agora você vai se sentir tão pequeno
E agora vai provar do próprio veneno
Seu feitiço agora acabou
Ficou claro quando um novo amor rolou

[Refrão]
Chora, chora
Agora chora, chora
Seu feitiço virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

[Verso 2]
Fiquei sabendo que anda pelos cantos
Sofrendo e lamentando porque perdeu tanto
As vantagens que aproveitou
A amizade que renegou
E agora ainda quer que eu me compadeça
Depois que fodeu toda a inocência
Encontrei meu auto-amor
Seu controle agora acabou

[Refrão]
Chora, chora
Filha da puta, agora chora, chora
Seu feitiço virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

[Verso 3]
Os boletos que não pagou
Quantas vezes me silenciou
E ainda veio achando que ia sair por cima
Comigo não
As contas que deixou pra trás
Vou mandar pra casa dos seus pais
E essa foi a última vez que me levantou a mão
Comigo não (Comigo não, comigo não)

[Refrão]
Chora, chora
Filha da puta, agora chora, chora
Seu feitiço virou contra e quebrou sua cara
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar
Para humilhar, para humilhar
Escolheu a pessoa errada para humilhar

Que engraçado que me olha assim
Com cara enjoada de fotografia
Agora que sabe, tem medo de mim

Tudo que eu tinha era papel de pão
E um único blues, o pedaço de céu

14237,New Dream,Roman Müller,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember back in high school?
Looking at us like fools
Were we crazy or misunderstood?
I had dreams of being someone
Traveling beyond the
Same city streets that we were used to

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm here on the other side of the world
A few more lines on my face, a little heartburn
But you know I'll keep dreaming of a new place
When I close my eyes, I'm seeing it

[Chorus]
I know, you're in my heart always
Where I go, this memory won't erase
Know, that the dreams are for the living
Even if they all come true, we start a new dream

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
As I see another sunrise
New light on an old life
We're the same and so much different now
Did you end up where you planned to?
Did love come to find you?
And was it like we used to talk about?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're here on the other side of the world
A few more lines on your face, a little heartburn
And I know we'll keep dreaming of a new place
When I close my eyes, I'm seeing it

[Chorus]
I know, you're in my heart always
Where I go, this memory won't erase
Know, that the dreams are for the living
Even if they all come true, we start a new dream

Everything you told me was the truth?
Once again alone at midnight
Once again I'm drinking over you
You treated me like I was special
You made me believe every lie
You made me feel like I was precious
When you held me tight
But guess I am learning my lesson
This is my saying goodbye
'Cause I figured you, figured you, figured you out

[Chorus]
Gonna love, love, love, love my life without you
'Cause I'm loving every moment that you're not around
No, I'm not gonna miss the mess you got me into
'Cause I figured you, figured you, figured you out
'Cause I figured you, figured you out
'Cause I figured you, figured you out

No more asking me for favors
Done picking you up, paying your bills
No more covering up your bad behavior

Rituals happen in the house
If you gon' tell me what it is, just tell me now
The lights keep flickerin' 'round and 'round

Let's do a magic trick, turn that frown upside down

Fell asleep by the window, we can look out
Wake up to the evil sounds of the owls

Have, have, have, have

Have, what the fuck do I have inside my bag?
I got pills in a bottle, wanna have one?
You can have one, maybe if you ask
Baby, you look so pretty, I wanna ask you
Do you wanna go on a date with me to the bathroom?
We can snort up these lines
We can do anything anytime if you want, I'ma have you
Baby, you look so good, you look like an angel
I'll be your sideman, I can be your devil
Devil on your shoulder, I'ma send you love letters
We can go to Hell or we can go to Heaven
We can go to Heaven, we can go to Heaven
You look so good make me hungry
I wanna eat you alive with some dumplings

Everything I have, it could be yours

Sua humanindade tava em todos, só você que não notou
Foi só você que não notou

Guiado a cada passo à um destino bem maior

[Verso 1]
Sabe aqueles dias que parece que nada segura?
Acordo e a primeira coisa bate
Bebi demais
Falei demais
Contas demais
Não sei se passo de hoje

[Verso 2]
Pensei em te dizer tanta coisa
Vi alguém que lembra você na rua
Penso demais
Tanto, demais
Já não sei mais

[Pré-refrão]
Mas de uma coisa eu sei
Que a pessoa pra mim é você
Mesmo com tudo dando errado

[Refrão]
Eu sei que eu tenho você
Apesar de todas as coisas da vida
Eu sei que eu tenho você
Eu sei que eu tenho você
Apesar de todas as coisas da vida
Eu sei que eu tenho você

Mundo líquido peixe
A vida de olhos abertos
No planeta das águas
Qualificam-se maravilhas
Quem revela os mistérios
E os rumos dos seres aquáticos
Suas naves famílias
O agudo mais grave das ondas
Vou povoar em sentidos
O negro mar boia hídrica
Vou ver Iara Amazônica
E seu cardume de náufragos
Vou debruçar meu caráter
No Negro Rio mata híbrida
Quero contar aos meus filhos
Sobre um mergulho fantástico

We don't see eye to eye, lately
With the warning signs
Flashing lights
Patience running low
I know, we know

You must say you hate me
At your parent's house
You walked out
I bet they're happy now
They know, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
You, take over my mind
For you, I'll take us back to

[Chorus]
The long drives, all night
On the backseat, come closer
I just wanna hold you
As we lay amongst the stars
We'll have a different kind of-
I love you, you love me
Say do you mean it?
Yeah, we're sweet
We'll have a different kind of us
A different kind of love
A different kind of love

[Verse 3]
Looking for a compromise, maybe
We can turn this round
It'll all work out
Go back to that love
That we both know

You, take over my mind
For you, I'll take us back to

Maybe we could take it slow
Have a different kind of us

Had to leave, I just couldn't bear to stay
Nothing's back in this place for me anyway
I want to see what is hiding across the sea
If there is something out there for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a train, ride a cab, catch a flight
Travel daytime into the night
All alone, grab a bag, pack it light
That's what life should be all about

[Chorus]
Go to Paris, London, Amsterdam
New York, Miami, got a plan
See Stockholm, travel through Japan
Go to Sydney, Bombay, Singapore
Berlin, Helsinki, that's for sure
Every city, I'll make it through them all
I'm a globetrotter

[Verse 2]
Had to leave, I'm just trying to find my way
On the road, living life each day by day
I want to know what it's like living dangerously
And if the world has a place for me

Snatch a bike, ride a boat, take a hike
Venture far to the morning light
All alone, got the world in my sight
That's what life should be all about

Go to Paris, London, Amsterdam
New York, Miami, got a plan
See Stockholm, travel through Japan
Go to Sydney, Bombay, Singapore

14273,Netflix & Chill,The Twinz,"So you don't have a job
It's not about how much you're making
As long as you love me every night, I'm good
So you don't have a car
It don't look good on paper
As long as you always treat me right, I'm good

We can watch Netflix and chill
Walk around naked, we will
'Til your mama comes in, and throws you out once again
Let us just break down the house
Smoke a little out on the couch
'Til your mama comes in, and throws you out once again

Did I just caught an L
Don't know, it's hard to tell
Someway you're kind of overdue
It's true
You say you'll change your ways
But there's no time to waste
'Cause you are almost 32
It's true

We can watch Netflix and chill
Baby, that won't pay the bills
If you keep messing up
One day, life will catch up
Baby, let's break down the house
Until they kick us out
All this money you've spent, on everything but the rent

Yes, I'm a sucker for love
Can believe that it's true
Somehow you stole my heart
I don't know what to do
Been hiding you from my friends
It's time to meet 'em I guess
Yes, I'm a sucker for love
But hey, you're a sucker too
Yes, I'm a sucker for love
But hey, you're a sucker too

Da da da da da da dum
Da da da da da da dum
Da da da da da da dum
You're a sucker too

14250,Strongest,Ina Wroldsen,"[Verse 1]
You sit there with that look on your face like you won
Like nothing that I say is gonna change how you feel now
You sit there and you tell me you fell outta love
And we are in your way so you just gotta leave now
And we just need to understand your reasons
And you are gonna justify this treason
By telling me the promises that we sworn ain't enough

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you gonna be another person?
And how do I explain this shit to our son?
How'd you tell a toddler about a girlfriend?
Daddy's gone

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

[Verse 2]
You sit there with your phone in your hands and you're hurt
You tell me that you feel like you lost me when he came
I'm sorry but I cannot connect with your words
'Cause right now what matters isn't yours but it is his name
And we just need to find another income
'Cause she wants you to help her with her own one
And you want me to tell me that what you've done is okay

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you gonna be another father?
And I will be a different kind of mother?
And you'd tell a toddler 'bout step brothers?
Daddy's strayed

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

[Bridge]
Let's talk about family
Let's talk about family
Let's talk of the ties and the lies
And the love that we had in this family
Let's talk about honesty
You know nothing about honesty
I'll let go of your hands and our plans
And the chance that we had with this family

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone
Oh na na, we'll leave you alone

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
I carry an anger, not so many have seen
It takes a lot of effort, not letting it carry me
It would never touch you or harm you in any way
It's more like something taunting keeping me restrained
It's almost like a ghost, for those who believe they see
Like an inner voice, a broken ego of me
And I don't care to be more like someone else
Just as an equal, I want to have something said

[Chorus]
Careless I may seem but caring it's all I do
Not to please others but to keep myself true
I'm singing, I'm breathing, just to keep it out
Sometimes the voice I hear is just too loud

Just too loud, just too loud
Oh, just too loud, oh, just too loud
Oh, just too loud, oh, just too loud
Just too loud, it's just too loud

Careless I may seem but caring it's all I do
Not to please others but to keep myself true
I'm singing, I'm breathing, just to keep it out
Sometimes the voice I hear is just too loud

[Verse 2]
I carry an anger, not so many have seen
It takes a lot of effort, not letting it carry me
I can't help the feeling, that I have to fight
From morning to evening and to catch up with life
It's almost like a song but the rhythm is offbeat
Like I am waking up from an old memory

[Chorus]
Careless I may seem but caring it's all I do
Not to please others but to keep myself true
I'm singing, I'm breathing, just to keep it out
Sometimes the voice I hear is just too loud

[Drop]
Just too loud, just too loud
Oh, just too loud, oh, just too loud

I was your sorry-ever-after

Swept the rug from under me
With your lemon nicotine kisses

We’re so good at connecting
Something like I’ve never seen
We’re like genies and their wishes

Electric like a cable
My heartbeat getting fatal
Rushing to my head and feet when u look at me
Shaking I’m unstable
I’ll put it on the table
So listen to me when I speak

I want you to feel my feelings
You’ve been stealing
I’m revealing
Do you feel my feelings like I do
Feel my feelings
Hit the ceiling
There Ain’t no leaving
Do you feel my feelings just for you

It’s starting to be a pattern
Where I can’t get a grip
My emotions can’t sit still

And the sound of your laughter
Has My heart on its own trip
In a chamber with no chill

Get your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
I'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty
Ain't gotta ask me to
Surprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty
Ain't gotta ask me to

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Alex Parker]
I told you you're a unicorn, posing in human uniform
Woman, I just don't think that you get it
See, you will always be art to me
And I will, myself, be a connoisseur
Girl even sounds of your snores
Make me zoom like the Commodores
I'm, over the moon
Under the influence
Of this drug you exude
You're a hallucinogen
And I think I'm addicted
I will never be lucid again
You removed negativity
Substituted with zen
And I'll tell you
O-o, over again
Just how important you are
And how much of a difference
You've made in just seven days
Girl, what an experience
I feel I'm weaker and stronger
Quieter, louder
Inward and outward
None- and all the above
I am other
Woman I really think that you may be my superpower
I am Dr. Manhattan and I can never be human again
We just fit together
And this has just been the best week ever

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
I don't have a problem meetin' mama and daddy
Honey and sugar, man I bet they're so classy
Half of me is good, the other half nasty
Can't help it if I want it, want it
Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior
Talk about relationships, I used to be a player
And like GEICO, the time I saved 'em
And get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
Lift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown
Ain't gotta ask me to
And right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it
Ain't gotta ask me to

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Outro 2x: Alex Parker]
You (you)
You are (are)
Are artwork to me (to me)

14259,With You,Foxa,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes this life's got me so blue
But I can count on happiness with you
The times that time just won't pass by
But hours feel like seconds when I'm with you

[Pre-Chorus]
With you, with you
With you, with you
Was scared to let you know my dreams came true
From all the days I've had this year
The best were all the ones I spent with you

[Chorus]
Whenever I am drowned in fear
I know that I can feel you nearer
Taking all the clouds away from view
And when my thoughts start to betray me
My emotions going crazy
I can walk on water with you

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Feels like I got too much to do
But I can be at rest when I'm with you
When I can't find my way back home
I can see the light when I'm with you

[Pre-Chorus]
With you, with you
With you, with you
Was scared to let you know my dreams came true
From all the days I've had this year
The best were all the ones I spent with you

[Chorus]
Whenever I am drowned in fear
I know that I can feel you nearer
Taking all the clouds away from view
And when my thoughts start to betray me
My emotions going crazy
I can walk on water with you

[Chorus]
Whenever I am drowned in fear
I know that I can feel you nearer
Taking all the clouds away from view

Pick me up, when i'm calling you
Ring, ring, ring I am all for you
Pick me up, come pick me up, there so much left to say
Love me now, before it’s too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, Hold on to me, you're putting me on hold

Hold on, Hold on to me, don't dare to let me go
Call on me, and i’m all for you

Let's just take a minute, take a breed of now
Run away we'll make it back somehow
Keep your head up, baby there is sometime
We got it all

Pillow talk we are saying then
Layers off when we're self healing
Take it off, come take it off
There is so much to undress
Hand in hand, till we're off this mess

"
14256,Blind,Ericé,"[Verse 1]
I lost my eyes in the Harlan pits in the year of '56
While pulling a faulty drill chain that was out of fix
It bounded from the wheel and there concealed my doom
I am a blind fiddler far from my home

[Verse 2]
I went up into Louisville to visit Dr. Laine
He operated on one of my eyes still it is the same
The Blue Ridge can't support me, it just ain't got the room
Would a wealthy colliery owner like to hear a fiddler's tune?

[Verse 3]
With politics and threatening tones the owners can control
And the unions have all left us a long, long time ago
Machinery lying scattered, no drill sounds in the mine
For all the good a collier is, he might as well be blind

[Verse 4]
Was a time I worked a long fourteen for a short eight bucks a day
You're lucky if you're mining, that's what the owners say
And if you've got complaining, you'd better aim to keep it low
How come they took my food stamps, does anybody know?

[Verse 5]
My father was a miner's son, a miner still is he
But his eyes have took a fever, and there's a shaking in his knee
The holes are closing rapidly, he cannot understand
A machine's got a bigger arm than him or any other man

[Verse 6]
Plastic for the windows, cardboard for the door
Baby's mouth is twisting, it'll twist a little more
""They need welders in Chicago"" falls hollow to the floor
How many miners made that trip a thousand times or more?

[Verse 7]
The lights are burning bright, there's laughter in the town
But the streets are dark and empty, there ain't a miner to be found
They're in some lonesome hollow where the sun refuse to shine
And the baby's screams are muffled in the sweetness of the wine

[Verse 8]
With a wife and four young children depending now on me
Whatever can I serve them with? My God, I cannot see
Through the Blue Ridge Mountains I am content to roam
Yes, I am a blind fiddler, far from my home
Yes, I am a blind fiddler, far from my home

Shaking I’m unstable

Telling my friends I've got something else to do

Something bout your body makes me stay

Es tan impredecible
Tan sensible que se irrita
Cuando gritas cuando, quieres respirar

Tu amor es algo tímido, reñido
Es algo típico
""nada especial""
Eso dirían los demás
Tu amor es como un tóxico
Es un efecto narcótico
Que amarra
Cuando quieres libertad
Yo te quiero así:
Tan satírica y fanática
Te quiero así, cuando vives
Cuando matas con o sin razón
Cuando callas, cuando hablas
Cuando amas
Y te quiero así:
Cuando alargas en el acto
Toda mi pasión
Cuando logras estrujarme
Con fascinación
No pretendo alejarme no quiero
Yo no puedo porque te quiero así
Así, así...

Tu amor es tan apático
Tan lúcido, romántico
Y algo brutal
Es una mezcla singular
Te arrulla, te desvela
Te calienta, te congela
Desorden total, es algo loco nada más
Es tan impredecible
Tan sensible que se irrita
Cuando gritas, cuando quieres respirar

No tengo motivo, no tengo razón
Pero te quiero tanto... tanto... tanto amor

(Es que tú sabes que te quiero así, Yo tengo el gusto de quererte)
Es una trampa, es una lanza
Que traspasa mi quietud
(Es que te quiero así, Yo tengo el gusto de quererte)
Cosa de fuerza mayor que me amarra
Cuando quiero libertad
(Es que te quiero así, Yo tengo el gusto de quererte)
Es que tu sabes que te quiero así, yo tengo el gusto de quererte
(Es que te quiero así) así yo tengo el gusto de quererte

Te quiero así no tengo culpa
No tengo motivo, no tengo razón
Pero te quiero tanto... tanto... tanto amor
(Es que tú sabes que te quiero así, Yo tengo el gusto de quererte)
(Es que tú sabes que te quiero así, Yo tengo el gusto de quererte)

Tu amor me arrulla, me desvela
Me calienta, me congela y me vive, me mata
(Así, Yo tengo el gusto de quererte, Es que tú sabes que te quiero así ...)

14300,Night Shift,Juze,"[Verse 1]
Dancing in the dark
When we move it’s something natural
We play and then we pause
And it gently drives me up the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder should I trust this old heart of mine
When I judge this vibe
Is it me or is it us, am I way too high
On Martini Dry?

[Chorus]
Now we slowly drift, oehoe
Through the night shift, night shift
Now we slowly drift, oehoe
Through the night shift, night shift

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, aaaaaah
Through the night shift
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, aaaaaah
Through the night shift

[Verse 2]
Dancing in the dark
There’s these banging lights inside my head
We go from two to one
It’s a feeling that I never had

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder should I trust this old heart of mine
When I judge this vibe
Is it me or is it us, am I way too high
On Martini Dry?

[Chorus]
Now we slowly drift, oehoe
Through the night shift, night shift
Now we slowly drift, oehoe
Through the night shift, night shift

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, aaaaaah
Through the night shift
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, aaaaaaah
Through the night shift

[Bridge]
Outta control now we’re working on the night shift
Don’t let me go now we’re working on the night shift
Losing my head on the floor you know I need this

[Chorus]
Now we slowly drift, oehoe
Through the night shift, night shift
Now we slowly drift, oehoe
Through the night shift, night shift

Now we slowly drift, oehoe
Through the night shift, night shift
Now we slowly drift, oehoe
Through the night shift, night shift

14305,Honey,Natania,"[Verse 1]
I've always been too young at heart
I set myself up to fall apart
Don't cut your fingers on the shards of glass
Don't keep your love inside jars

[Pre-Chorus]
I might grow out of t-shirts
But I won't grow out of you
I only choke on my words
'Cause I know I'm not your

Honey, honey, honey (Oh)
Honey, there's nothing
That tastes the way you do
Honey, honey, honey (Oh)
Honey, there's nothing
That tastes the way you do
You do
Mm, you do

[Verse 2]
They used to tell me sugar is bad for you (Mm)
I should've listened but I can't undo
Setting ambitions on things far from view
No kind of distance pries a wolf from the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
I might grow out of t-shirts
But I won't grow out of you
I only choke on my words
'Cause I know I'm not your

Honey, honey, honеy (Oh)
Honey, there's nothing

14319,Muscle Memory,Natania,"I've been doing great
Living gold days
Working on reconstructing
Put a lot on my plate
Right out the gate
So I don't start self-destructing
My idle mind is like your plaything
This vicious cycle isn't breaking

I got all these new friends
We go out on the weekends
Bought those Doctor Martens
I sublet my apartment

But I'm still hit with muscle memory
When it's quarter to three
My hands remember reaching for you
It's my co-dependency, my muscle memory
My heart remembers beating for you

When I was stressed I call you to vent
Now it's just overwhelming
Still write those texts, just don't press send
Stupid and it isn't helping

I'm a lost cause in the making
This vicious cycle isn't breaking

I got all these new friends
We go out on the weekends
Bought those Doctor Martens
I sublet my apartment

But I'm still hit with muscle memory
When it's quarter to three
My hands remember reaching for you
It's my co-dependency, my muscle memory
My heart remembers beating for you

I got all these new friends
We go out on the weekends
But I'm still hit, hit
But I'm still hit, hit
I got all these new friends
We go out on the weekends
But I'm still hit, hit
But I'm still hit, hit

Loving the danger
You set me on fire
When I'm by your side
You taking me higher
I follow you down if we go down
Now you say you wanna get away
You wanna take me all the way

[Pre-Chorus: IVIE]
Might get burned if you get too closer
To the sun (I want yah)
We can burn together
Fading into one another
Ohh!!!

[Chorus: IVIE]
Well don't you know
You're still heaven to me
Baby, we could run free
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you

[Verse 2: IVIE]
My deepest of secrets
Trust you to keep 'em
Hiding the worlds
You cannot say
I got what you wanted
I got what you needed
It's all in the way
That you say my name

Might get burned if you get too closer
To the sun (I want yah)
We can burn together
Fading into one another

Never mind all our worries
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you

Tengo un Dios admirable en los cielos
Y el amor de su Espíritu Santo

Y de gozo se llena mi canto
De su imagen soy un reflejo
Que me lleva por siempre en victoria
Y me ha hecho cabeza y no cola
En mi Cristo yo todo lo puedo

Si el enemigo me tienta en la carrera

Y tengo un Dios admirable en los cielos
Que me libra de mal y temores

Me defiende de los opresores
No me deja, ni me desampara
Pues mi Dios es Señor de señores

14336,Un Montón De Estrellas,Polo Montañez,"[Letra de ""Un Montón De Estrellas""]

[Verso 1]
Yo no sé por qué razón cantarle a ella
Si debía aborrecerla con las fuerzas de mi corazón
Todavía no la borro totalmente
Ella siempre está presente como ahora en esta canción
Incontables son las veces que he tratado
De olvidarla y no he logrado
Arrancarla ni un segundo de mi mente
Porque ella sabe todo mi pasado
Me conoce demasiado y es posible que por eso se aproveche

[Coro]
Porque yo en el amor soy un idiota
Que ha sufrido mil derrotas
Que no tengo fuerzas para defenderme
Pero ella casi siempre se aprovecha
Unas veces me desprecia
Y otras veces lo hace para entretenerme y es así

[Verso 2]
Aún recuerdo la canción que le hice un día
Que en el fondo no sabía que eso era malo para mí
Poco a poco fui cayendo en un abismo
Siempre me pasó lo mismo
Nadie sabe lo que yo sufrí
Una victima total de sus antojos
Pero un día abrí los ojos
Y con rabia la arranqué de mi memoria
Poco a poco fui saliendo hacia adelante
Y en los brazos de otra amante
Pude terminar al fin con esta historia

[Coro]
Porque yo en el amor soy un idiota
Que ha sufrido mil derrotas
Que no tengo fuerzas para defenderme
Pero ella casi siempre aprovechaba
Si algún día me besaba
Eso era solo para entretenerme y es así

[Puente 1]
Todo fue así, así mismo fue
Todo fue por ella
Yo la quería, yo la adoraba
Pero tenía que aborrecerla
Todo fue así, oye
Todo fue por ella
Como yo quise a esa mujer
Porque pensaba que era buena
Todo fue así, ay, Dios
Todo fue por ella
Yo era capaz de subir al cielo
Para bajarle un montón de estrellas
Todo fue así
Todo fue por ella
Un pajarito que iba volando
Yo lo cogí para complacerla
Todo fue así, ay, Dios
Todo fue por ella
Tanto se burló de mí
Que ahora no puedo verla

[Instrumental]

[Puente 2]
Todo fue así, así mismo fue
Todo fue por ella
Por bobo me pasó
Todo fue así, me enamoré de ella
Todo fue por ella
Y luego ella me dejó
Todo fue así, oye
Todo fue por ella
Así mismo fue
Todo fue así, oye
Todo fue por ella
Yo la quería, yo la adoraba
Pero tenía que aborrecerla
Todo fue así, ay, Dios
Todo fue por ella
Como yo quise a esa mujer
Porque pensaba que era buena
Todo fue así, oye
Todo fue por ella
Yo era capaz de subir al cielo
Para bajarle un montón de estrellas
Todo fue así, ay, Dios
Todo fue por ella
Un pajarito que iba volando
Yo lo cogí para complacerla
Todo fue así, oye
Todo fue por ella
Tanto se burló de mí
Que ahora no puedo verla

14311,Back To Me,KAJ,"[Verse 1]
Stressing myself to death learning how to change
Don't wanna see the loving disintegrate
Twenty-four hours, I've been off of my face

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm wondering
Do you trust, do you trust me at all?
Do you trust, do you trust me at all?

[Chorus 1]
Give away the world
Remember when I loved you even at your worst
I'm not perfect, no I never claimed I would be
But I can make a record if you make it back to me

[Hook]
So come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

Call me your second best, honestly it's fine
I know your parents think all I do is lie
Twenty-four hours, I'm losing track of time

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm wondering
Do you trust, do you trust me at all?
Do you trust, do you trust me at all?

[Chorus 2]
Take me at my word
If you don't think I'm honest throw my heart in dirt
Just give away the world
Remember when I loved you even at your worst
I'm not perfect, no I never claimed I would be
But I can make a record if you make it back to me

[Hook]
So come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

[Bridge]
Please turn around, on the 5 southbound
Come back to me now, Come back to me now
Please turn around, on the 5 southbound
Come back to me now, Come back to me now

But I can make a record if you make it back to me

Driving down the wrong road
Playing games and feeling low
Messing with my mind

How'd you do it this time?
Don't know where it all goes
Leaving me behind

Can you take a step back?
Tired of playing catch up
Would it really hurt you that much?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's right in front of your face
Yet you look the wrong way
Can you feel my touch?

But it feels like every time
You look at me that way
You feel the love in your heart
But you don't know what to say

[Chorus]
I'm tired of playing games
Let's throw the board away
Oh can you give love a try
Even if it's for a day?

Threw away your first chance
What happened to our romance?
Let's do it a second time

I can't stand here all day
Soon I'll look the other way
Why can't you just be mine?

Let's embrace the sunshine
Winter's gone and you'll be fine
Darling let's believe in us

[Pre-Chorus]
It's right in front of your face
Yet you look the wrong way
Can't you feel my touch?

But it feels like every time
You look at me that way

Tengo la mente en Dubai
Guarda esos momentos

No, no, no, no te pongas nerviosa

Como las hojas al viento, como el sol espanta al frío
Como la tierra a la lluvia, como el mar espera al río
Así espero tu regreso a la tierra del olvido
Ay

[Verso 2]
Como naufragan mis miedos si navego en tu mirada
Como alertas mis sentidos con tu voz enamorada
Con tu sonrisa de niña como me mueves el alma
Como me quitas el sueño, como me robas la calma

[Coro]
Tú tienes la llave de mi corazón
Yo te quiero
Mas que mi vida porque sin tu amor
Yo me muero
Tú tienes la llave de mi corazón
Yo te quiero
Mas que mi vida porque sin tu amor
Yo me muero

14322,Kissing Mouths,Natania,"I've been kissing mouths that aren't yours but I want yours
Picking phones up late at night but I want more
I miss the way that you would talk me off the ledge
You knew me better than I ever knew myself

This is me trying to get you out of my head
This is me findin' that I'm not done with us yet

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I've been kissing mouths like they were yours
I've been kissing mouths like they would
Cure me like you used to do
'Cause I'm so sick of wanting you
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I've been kissing mouths but I want yours

I've been kissing bottles ever since you left
Nowadays I only drink what you would get
You're the only substance that could substitute
So until you come back to me this will have to do

This is me trying to get you out of my head
This is me findin' that I'm not done with us yet

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I've been kissing mouths like they were yours
I've been kissing mouths like they would
Cure me like you used to do
'Cause I'm so sick of wanting you
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I've been kissing mouths but I want yours
(I want yours)
I've been kissing mouths like they would
Cure me like you used to do
I'm so sick of wanting you)
I've been kissing mouths but I want yours
I've been kissing mouths but I want yours

[Intro]
Yo sólo quiero pegar en la radio
Yo sólo quiero pegar en la radio

[Verso 1]
Estoy ya cansado de estar endeudado
De verte sufriendo por cada centavo
Dejémoslo todo y vámonos para Miami
Voy a lo que voy, a volverme famoso
A la vida de artista, a vivir de canciones
Vender ilusiones que rompan diez mil corazones

[Coro]
Yo sólo quiero pegar en la radio
Para ganar mi primer millón
Para comprarte una casa grande
En donde quepa tu corazón
Yo sólo quiero que la gente cante
Por todos lados esta canción
Desde San Juan hasta Barranquilla
Desde Sevilla hasta Nueva York

[Puente]
Yo te repito que
Me van a escuchar
En la radio en la televisión
Y así será mi primer millón

[Verso 2]
Apenas lleguemos, llamamos a Emilio
Yo tengo un amigo, amigo de un amigo
Con línea directa al cielo de tantas estrellas
Despues andaremos de aquí para alla
Con Paulina Rubio y Alejandro Sanz
Tranquila querida, Paulina sólo es una amiga

[Coro]
Yo sólo quiero pegar en la radio
Para ganar mi primer millón
Para comprarte una casa grande
En donde quepa tu corazón
Yo sólo quiero que la gente cante
Por todos lados esta canción
Desde Kabul hasta Curaçao
Desde El Callao hasta Panamá

[Coro]
Yo sólo quiero pegar en la radio
Para ganar mi primer millón
Para comprarte una casa grande
En donde quepa tu corazón
Yo sólo quiero que la gente cante
Por todos lados esta canción
De Guayaquil a Santo Domingo
Desde Tijuana hasta Salvador

[Puente]
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Échale pa' delante o échale pa' allá
Que echa pa' delante, echa pa' delante
Echa pa' delante y echa pa' delante
Ya quiero salir de esta bicicleta
Salir a rumbear sin pensar en la cuenta
Comprarte un vestido de Oscar de la Renta
Tranquila que ahí viene mi primer millón
Y como digo yo
Yo sólo quiero pegar en la radio
Yo sólo quiero pegar en la radio
Yo sólo quiero pegar en la radio
Yo sólo quiero pegar en la radio

Woh-oh-oh-oh

Quiero que me recuerdes
Por la canción que nos hacía callar
Esa que nos decía
De que algun día la despedida tenía que llegar
No, no es un capricho
Tan solo es algo que te quiero yo pedir
Hoy para siempre, para que te acuerdes de mí
Adiós (Adiós), estoy muy triste
Pues hoy que tú te fuiste
Se oyó nuestra canción
Para que nunca la olvidaramos los dos
Adiós (Adiós), ya no podemos seguir, lo siento
No pude hacerte yo feliz, me voy
Pero me llevo yo de ti
El amor que por ti yo sentí
Busca tus sueños y no pienses más en mí
Ah

14373,Un Montón de Estrellas,Lenier,"[Letra de ""Un Montón De Estrellas""]

[Intro]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Oh-oh

[Verso 1]
Yo no sé por qué razón cantarle a ella
Si debía aborrecerla
Con las fuerzas de mi corazón
Todavía no la borro totalmente
Ella siempre está presente
Como ahora en esta canción

[Pre-Coro]
Incontables son las veces que he tratado
De olvidarla y no he logrado
Arrancarla ni un segundo de mi mente
Porque ella sabe todo mi pasado
Me conoce demasiado
Y es posible que por eso se aproveche

[Coro]
Porque yo еn el amor soy un idiota
Que ha sufrido mil derrotas
Quе no tengo fuerzas para defenderme
Pero ella casi siempre se aprovecha
Unas veces me desprecia y otras veces
Lo hace para entretenerme y es así
Así
Y es así

[Verso 2]
Ay, yo no sé qué fue lo que me hizo que me enamoré
Que caí en su trampa y en su hechizo de mujer
Mira que trato, pero no la olvido
Mi vida no tiene sentido
Si no la tengo aquí conmigo

[Coro]
Porque yo en el amor soy un idiota
Que ha sufrido mil derrotas
Que no tengo fuerzas para defenderme
Pero ella casi siempre se aprovecha
Unas veces me desprecia y otras veces
Lo hace para entretenerme y es así

[Puente]
Todo fue así
Así mismo fue
Todo fue por ella
Yo la quería, yo la adoraba, pero tenía que aborrecerla
Todo fue así
Ay, Dio'
Todo fue por ella (¡dice!)
Cómo yo quise a esa mujer (cómo la quise)
Porque pensaba que era buena
Todo fue así
Ay, Dio'
Todo fue por ella
Un pajarito que iba volando yo lo cogí para complacerla

14352,Contigo,Pete Perignon,"[Letra de ""Sería Una Pena""]

[Intro]
Cualquier parecido con la realidad

[Verso 1]
Tengo un amigo que tiene todo, todo lo que necesita
Billete, carro, y trabajo, la casa y la noviecita
Su vida parece plena si de afuera he de mirarlo
Pero tiene un triste dilema y no sé cómo ayudarlo

[Verso 2]
El caso es que este panita mío vive infeliz todo el tiempo
Se que queja si hace calor, se queja si sopla el viento
Y yo para aconsejarlo lе canto entre mis pregonеs

[Coro]
Sería una pena que usted se fuera a morir de viejo tan joven
Sería una pena que usted se fuera a morir de viejo tan joven
Recuerda que lo que el hombre siembra eso también lo recoge
Sería una pena que usted se fuera a morir de viejo tan joven
Y la verdad es que vives en una mansión
Pero tu corazón está cogiendo cupones
Sería una pena que usted se fuera a morir de viejo tan joven
Tu tira y jala, tu tira y jala, tira y jala con tu mujer
Muchacho, en vez de brindarle flores
Sería una pena que usted se fuera a morir de viejo tan joven
Escucha bien, no puede llegar a viejo
El que al consejo se opone
Sería una pena que usted se fuera a morir de viejo tan joven

[Interludio]
Oye, Pete
Aconséjalo, brother
Ahí na' ma'

[Coro]
Si usted es de esa gente que dice que esto se murió
Y que lo de antes eran mejores
Sería una pena que usted se fuera a morir de viejo tan joven
Recuerde, tenga en mente que todo maestro ya nos dieron sus bendiciones
Sería una pena que usted se fuera a morir de viejo tan joven
Que pena me da contigo
Te perdiste el bautismo y la ceremonia, yo espero que reflexiones
Da pena con esa

[Pos-Coro]
Si no agradeces lo que tienes, entonces el tiempo pierdes
El tiempo pasa y no vuelve
Es igualito a la arena que en tus manos se disuelve
El tiempo pasa y no vuelve
Dale un beso a tu familia que con cariño te envuelve
El tiempo pasa y no vuelve
La ansiedad se va borrando cuando la esperanza hierve
El tiempo pasa y no vuelve
Camina y resuelva

[Outro]
Que cosa hermano
Que a veces el que más tiene, menos agradece

14385,Abracadabra,Elvis Crespo,
14354,Castigo,Srta. Dayana,"[Letra de ""Por Cuba la Que Me Vio Nacer""]

[Intro]
¡Levántate!
Dedicación para todos mis hermanos de Cuba
Que pasan por un momento triste, doloroso y de sufrimiento y desesperación
Quiero que sepas que no estás solo
Hay una voz que nos escucha
Hay una voz que siempre es de lucha
En dedicación a mi patria querida Cuba
La que me vio nacer

La que me vio nacer está llorando sangre, tiene miedo
Hay que hechar pa'lante
La que mе vio nacer no tengo ná que darlе, sólo el corazón
Como cantante
Que Dios te bendiga
Que Dios te bendiga
Si hay que morirse contigo
Yo te entrego mi vida

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reir, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste tú la que me vio nacer

Yo soy la calle, soy los adoquines, yo soy la bandera
Yo soy el pueblo en los escombros tirados en la carretera
Soy las raíces, soy las cicatrices, yo soy la cantera
Yo soy cubano y Cuba corre dentro de mis venas
Yo soy la casa que cayó
El suelo que se quebranta
El árbol que resistió
El nudo en esta garganta
El techo que se desplomó y todo el pueblo lo levanta
¡Somos Cuba! y Cuba no se espanta

La isla que me vio nacer
Levántense que hoy es un nuevo amanecer
Un nuevo obstáculo para brincar
Juntos vamos a vencer
Somos más fuertes y aunque el diablo quiera hacer el mal
Somos hijos de Dios
Y por ende, eso no va a pasar
Soy cubano y en nombre de Cuba exsorto a mis paisanos
A que trabajemos juntos y juntos darnos la mano
Tanta presión en el hombre que a veces nos equivocamos
Un trabajo en equipo es orgánico y más sano
Nos caíamos, nos levantamos y de cero se empieza
No se depriman, sigan pa'lante, abran las puertas
Reciban la ayuda que con el corazón le mandamos
Y que Jehová bendiga a mi país y a mis hermanos
Mis condolencias pa' los familiares de los fallecidos
Y una recuperación pronta pa' todos los heridos
Puño arriba todo el que esté conmigo por la que me vio nacer
Fuerza de corazón le pido

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reir, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste tú la que me vio nacer

Nunca es tarde si la dicha es buena
Siempre hay calma tras de la tormenta
Si la música en tu pecho suena
Y te cura el dolor y la pena
Nunca es tarde si tú estás conmigo
Nunca es tarde si yo estoy contigo
Con tu mirada tú me das amor
Si tienes frío yo te presto abrigo

Lágrimas en los ojos del que se siente cubano
Es que somos uno solo donde quiera que estamos ¡Sí!
Y lo que sufre uno lo sufrimos todos
Como buen vecino, codo con codo
No tengo mucho pero todo te lo doy
Micha presente como cubano que soy
Lo que se perdió ayer, lo recuperamos hoy
No me olvido de donde vengo
Por eso estoy donde estoy
Se acabo el mundo por la madrugada
Fue de sorpresa nadie lo esperaba
Arrancando techos, puertas y ventanas
Parece que el diablo paso por La Habana
Pero allá arriba hay un Dios que está chequeando
Minuto a minuto en el mundo lo que está pasando
Esto es una pesadilla, pellíscame que estoy soñando
Pero es increíble, nos estamos recuperando

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reír, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste tú la que me vio nacer

Sé que sientes el dolor como lo siento yo
Ante un golpe tan atroz no queda aquí en un corazón, no, no
Sólo te pido, hermano, estréchale la mano
A ese que hoy sufre y en segundos lo ha perdido todo

Esa isla del Caribe que ahora yace desolada
Merece nuestro respeto como madre dedicada
Allí vi mis días primeros y ella me tomó en sus brazos
Las lágrimas se me saltan cuando la veo en pedazos

Mi verdad es sincera desde lo más profundo de mi corazón
Hoy estoy cantando para toda mi nación
Para mi tierra querida donde yo nací
Esa misma tierra a la que le sirvió Martí
Necesitamos más ayuda y menos bobería
No la falta de fe y tanta gritería
Necesitamos la verdad y que no nos juzguen tanto
Y arreglar lo que haya que arreglar para que cese el llanto

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reir, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste tú la que me vio nacer

No cierres tu corazón si gozas de la solvencia
Sé que mucho te costó, pero llama a tu consciencia
Donde más ha caído del dolor de la indigencia
Llevándole nuestra ayuda con amor y transparencia
Cuando el puño está cerrado no se puede dar la mano
El que sufre, el que padece
Ese también es tu hermano
En momentos como este podemos hacer que solo
Apartando divisiones, brille un mundo mejor
Ayudar aunque esté lejos ahora es el mejor momento
Los de adentro y los de afuera, combatiendo un sufrimiento
Mostremos a los hermanos la fuerza del sentimiento
Cuando de verdad se ama, porque de Dios es el tiempo

Levántate, comienza de cero
Vive la vida, empieza de nuevo
Levántate, eh eh eh eh eh eh
Levántate, eh eh eh eh eh eh

Junto con las voces de desesperación
Mi pueblo grita
Y con mucha fe y esperanza infinita
¡Unión! Es lo que mi pueblo necesita
¡Unión! Y con sangre en nuestra historia esta escrita
Quisiera que me entierren en la que me vio nacer
Con mi pueblo y su gente
Porque nacimos con el corazón valiente
Y pa' que el mundo nos vea
Ni un huracán nos gana la pelea
Y cuando la cosa se pone fea
Mi Cuba siempre pichea, siempre pichea
Ningún desastre natural te quita el encanto
Por eso te hicimos este canto
Mi tierra linda, te amo tanto, te amo tanto

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reir, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste tú la que me vio nacer

Yo le canto a la tierra donde nací
Donde me levante, donde me caí
Donde todos mis amigos aún siguen ahí
Sé que aun me necesitan y ya estoy aquí
Lo poco que me queda yo te lo daré
Le pido a los míos que no pierdan la fe
En las buenas y las malas yo siempre estaré
Y que cosas como estas no sucedan otra vez
A los que sufren yo les doy mis bendiciones
A los que se fueron los llevo en mis oraciones
Llego la hora de ponerse los pantalones
Y hacer lo que se supone
Juntemos las voces que mi Cuba se levanta
Yo regalo música, por eso se le canta
Y contar un sueño bien bonito que me encanta
Que estaba en mi azotea y lanzaba al aire una paloma blanca

Llora, llora y desahógate
Llora, llora, pero levántate
Llora, llora que yo lloraré
Llora, llora, pero levántate
Me he caído muchas veces
Y todas esas veces que he caído, he llorado
Y yo he llorado, pero nunca ha sido en vano
Me he levantado, porque soy cubano

Soy un congo que vino de la loma
Yo soy carabalí
Tata enkisee, siete rayos, Yoruba
Gallo kikirikí
Soy quiñongo, babalawo
Soy Ocha con corazón de pobre
Y con la bendición de su madre
La Caridad del Cobre

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reír, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste tú la que me vio nacer

Yo sacrificó mis manos y mi amor
Pa' aquel que le haga falta, doy el corazón
Voy a dar mi palabra y a donar mi voz
Por todo lo triste que pasó
Mi cura es la pena del caído
Olvidarme es imposible
Las historias de mi Malecón
Y el Morro viejo que vive

La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reír, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste tú la que me vio nacer
La que me vio nacer
La que me vio jugar, la que me vio reír, la que me vio correr
Juntemos la voz y vamos a pedir un nuevo amanecer
Fuiste tú la que me vio nacer
La que me vio nacer

¡Que Dios los bendiga!

14353,Antes y Después De Ti,Ralphy Dreamz,"Miento cuando niego que te quiero
Pero voy a ser honesto
Lo que siento yo por dentro
Nunca se lo digo a nadie
No soy bueno en los detalles
Pero mi amor es sincero
Y eso es lo más importante

Llegaste a cambiar a mi memoria
Porque tus ojitos me enamoran
Y ahora lo comprendo
Qué se siente amar a otra persona

Y a ti
A ti sí me nace escribirte canciones
Y mandarte rosas de todos colores
Tomarte la mano y verte sonreír

Y a ti
A ti sí me nace decirte te quiero
Y te lo confieso, el mayor de mis miedos
Es que un día te vayas muy lejos de mí

Mil tropiezos en mi trayectoria
En dos partes divido mi historia
Antes y después de ti

Llegaste a cambiar a mi memoria
Porque tus ojitos me enamoran
Y ahora lo comprendo
Qué se siente amar a otra persona

Y a ti
A ti sí me nace escribirte canciones
Y mandarte rosas de todos colores

Yo sé que cuando estás sola



Te encierras en tu cuarto y lloras
Y tratas de olvidar cada hora

Aquellas que causaron ruido
Diciendo cosas sin sentido
Quedas nadando en ese mar

Pero soy sincero
Quiero curarte la herida, si puedo
¿Cómo sacarte todo ese veneno?
Solo te pido una oportunidad, ah

Pero soy sincero
Quiero curarte la herida, si puedo
¿Cómo sacarte todo ese veneno?
Solo te pido una oportunidad, ay

No quiero más peleas contigo, no
No me cierres la puerta
Pues no quiero más peleas contigo, no
Acepta mis disculpas, no seré igual
Creo que he mejorado mi forma de actuar porque
No quiero más peleas contigo

Dime, ¿por qué me peleas?
¿Qué más yo debo hacer pa' que creas?
Entiéndeme que he sido así porque nunca viví
Con un amor de adeveras

Ese amor que das tú
Va enseñándome la luz
Poniendo mis dos pies en la tierra
Sacando mi mente de la guerra, oh

No quiero más peleas contigo, no
No me cierres la puerta
Pues no quiero más peleas contigo, no
Acepta mis disculpas, no seré igual
Creo que he mejorado mi forma de actuar porque
No quiero más peleas contigo, no

Esta la hice para ti, pues no puedo más
Tener que ver salir tantas lágrimas
Por tanta tontería que me dan
Con hablar que siempre están de más

Y yo escribí ésta nota
Pues se me nota
Que vine buscando tu atención y mil cosas
Es tu mirada la que a mí siempre me trae la calma

En tu mirada fue que yo siempre encontré mi calma, yeih
Y si me miras te das cuenta que sanaste el alma
Pero soy sincero quiero curarte la herida, si puedo
¿Cómo sacarte todo ese veneno?
Solo te pido una oportunidad, ay

No quiero más peleas contigo
No me cierres la puerta, pues
No quiero más peleas contigo (no)
Acepta mis disculpas, no seré igual
Creo que he mejorado mi forma de actuar porque
No quiero más peleas contigo, no (Jay Kalyl)

14355,Amor de Verdad,Dama,"(INTRO)
Dispuesto a darte amor de verdad
Te pido una oportunidad
Todo lo que tengo cariño sincero
Los sentimientos de un rapero

(VERSO 1: KROWELL)
Estoy en casa pensando a diario
Si me dijeras que sí, yo ya no sería de barrio
Mucha gente me critica porque soy un pandillero
Pero tu bien sabes que yo a ti te quiero

Vivo en el guetto porque allí tengo
Lo que en mi casa no tengo
Y lo que tengo no lo quiero
Pero solo por ti y mi familia muеro
Por ti yo sería capaz
De dejar las guеrras y vivir en paz

Pero como sé que no quieres hacerme caso
Por eso mis intentos solo son fracasos

Yo solo quiero estar entre tus brazos
Y si moriría hoy, en este momento me dieran de balazos
En el cuerpo
Y si yo me fuera, me iría contento

(CORO)
Dispuesto a darte amor de verdad
Tan solo te pido una oportunidad
Darte todo lo que tengo cariño sincero
Dedicarte mil versos
Sentimientos de un rapero (X2)

(VERSO 2: GRISER NSR)
Te doy el universo que de frente no me atrevo
Es un sentimiento quizás es algo nuevo
No sé qué pasa cuando te miro pasar
Se me eriza la piel, me dan ganas de gritar

De pedirte que me des una oportunidad
De estar a tu lado, huir de mi soledad
De decirte que me encantas y mi miedo es más enorme
Con tan solo un hola no me quedo conforme

No me quedo conforme porque quiero ser tu mundo
Quiero que me quieras, que sientas algo profundo
Sentimiento de un rapero
Que te quiero, te prefiero
Me refiero que sin ti me muero

Me muero porque siento que te amo
Y aun no somos nada
Y es que, que linda te ves sin tu cara maquillada
Cariño sincero te estoy ofreciendo
No dudes y ve, mi amor va creciendo

(CORO)
Dispuesto a darte amor de verdad
Tan solo te pido una oportunidad
Darte todo lo que tengo cariño sincero
Dedicarte mil versos
Sentimientos de un rapero (X2)

(KROWELL)
Estoy en casa pensando, escribiendo en mi libreta
Yo no soy como los demás por favor ya daté cuenta
Muchos intentan, te ilusionan, te lastiman
Yo no soy la rosa que tiene las espinas
No creas que yo soy malo, solo porque soy de barrio
Yo solo escribo canciones de lo que vivo a diario
Solo tengo un defecto
Que no soy perfecto
Pero a las damas yo las trato con respeto

(GRISER NSR)
Respeto a una dama
Que no solo son pa' llevarlas a la cama
Todo un caballero
Aunque sea rapero
Ella es hermosa
Como una rosa
Chica maravillosa

Que no me de oportunidad
De volverte a perdonar

Y no te creo, pero insinúas que me quieres
Y allá voy, otra vez
Otra vez buscando siempre en ti lo bueno (Lo bueno)

En este film velado en blanca noche
El hijo tenaz de tu enemigo
El muy verdugo cena distinguido
Una noche de cristal que se hace añicos

Y no lo soñé
Se enderezó y brindó a tu suerte
Y no lo soñé
Y se ofreció mejor que nunca
No mires por favor y no prendas la luz
La imagen te desfiguró

Este film da una imagen exquisita
Chicos son como bombas pequeñitas
El mejor camino a la cueva del perico
Para tipos que no duermen por la noche

Y no lo soñé
Ibas corriendo a la deriva
Y no lo soñé
Los ojos ciegos bien abiertos
No mires por favor y no prendas la luz
La imagen te desfiguró

El montaje final es muy curioso
Es en verdad realmente entretenido
Vas en la oscura multitud desprevenido
Tiranizando a quienes te han querido

Y no lo soñé
Ibas corriendo a la deriva

Se pasa el tiempo y sigue la vida
Mantengo mi promesa
De no causarte más enojos
La dieta, el viaje a Europa
Y el nuevo Lamborghini rojo

¡Ay! este año sí dejo de fumar
Y tanta rumba con mis amigos
Llegó el momento e’ ponerme a ahorrar
Que se enderece al fin mi camino

Este año compro casa
Y una finquita con piscina
Figura bicicleta
Pa’ no faltar a la oficina

Y si este año no fue

Si lo dejó su mujer (upa)
Otra más buena vendrá
Y si este año se fue
Otro mejor llegará

Que yo le voy a pagar

Siento que este es el momento de portarme como es
De aprender por fin inglés
Y que coja fundamento
De inventar mentira y cuento
Alejarme de los vicios
Y pegarme al ejercicio
Aunque todo se descuadre (uy)

No se preocupe compadre
Que yo le pago con juicio
Voy a hacer el sacrificio
Para que usted se desvare

Y si este se fue (ay)
Quizás el otro será
Si lo dejó su mujer (uy)

Y si este año no fue
Quizás el otro será
Si lo dejó su mujer (upa)

Si la casa no la compro
Si la rumba no me deja
Si la visa se me añeja
Y si las promesas rompo

Si en la cicla no me monto
Si el carrito se embolata
Si los impuestos me matan
No me ponga un abogado (ae)

Que aunque esté bien embalado
Yo le consigo su plata
Deme una espera y se aguanta
Igual que el años pasado
Deme una espera y se aguanta
Igual que el años pasado

Llegué a la discoteca
Esa mirada coqueta creo que me cambió la vida
Bailamos la noche entera
Luego hicimos el amor y con el sol la despedida...

La primera noche, probé de su cuerpo y me enamoré
Y en solo una noche con par de tequilas yo la conquisté

El sábado solo quería dormir
Pero la luna me invitó a salir
Llegue con mis amigos a aquel bar
No imaginaba lo que iba a pasar

De repente vi esa hembra
Le dije usted no se ofenda
Pero está hecha a mi medida

Hablamos de todo un poco
Y entre tragos y miradas termino ella siendo mia

La primera noche, probé de su cuerpo y me enamoré

Y les confieso me muero de ganas por verla otra vez

Déjenme contarles la mejor
A mi el domingo me trajo el amor
En la playa yo la conocí
Nadando entre sus besos yo me vi

Y en un bote de vela
Le pinté con acuarela estrellitas en el mar
Imagínense, la escena despertamos en la arena
Así como Eva y adan

La primera noche, probé de su cuerpo y me enamoré
Y en solo una noche y un par de besitos yo la conquisté
Y les confieso me muero de ganas por verla otra vez

No puedo creer lo que mis ojos están viendo, acabo de verla entrar con otro hombre y darle un beso

Mis amigos es la misma que en el bar yo conocí
Y el Domingo fue solita para mi...

El fin de semana probé de su cuerpo y me enamoré
Y en solo una noche y un par de tequilas yo la conquisté

Y yo tampoco ya no tengo ganas
Y les confieso ya no tengo ganas... de verla otra vez

Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento

[Verso 1: Farruko]
Ya, ya, ya, ¡Farru!
Y aprovecha que el sol 'tá caliente y vamo' a disfrutar el ambiente
Vámono’ a meternos pa'l agua pa' que veas qué rico se siente
Y vámono' en tropical, por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro paramo' a darno' una Medalla
Bien fría, pa' bajar la sequía
Un poco de Bob Marley y unos trago’ ’e sangría
Pa' que te sueltes, poco a poquito
Porque pa’ vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Y dale lento, date un shot de Coquito
Y como dice Fonsi, vamo' a darle despacito (Ya, ya, ya)
Pa' que te suelte', poco a poquito
Porque pa’ vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico (Laramercy gang)

[Coro: Pedro Capó & Farruko]
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres busca bullas
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, baby, tú estás dura y me gusta

[Post-Coro: Pedro Capó & Farruko]
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento

[Verso 2: Farruko]
Farru, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Y darle lento, métele violento
Te puse reggaetón pa' que me apague' ese cuerpo
Métele hasta abajo, está duro ese movimiento
El único testigo que tenemos aquí e' el viento
Y dale, métele cintura, mátame con tu hermosura
Mira cómo me frontea porque sabe que está dura

[Puente: Pedro Capó & Farruko]
Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos andando
Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si andamos juntitos bailando

[Coro: Pedro Capó & Farruko]
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres busca bullas
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Oh my god baby
Dare I ask
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Return of the Mack, there it is
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
I had dreams of being up
I ain't never leave you stuck (oh my god)
And you say you will never turn on me, baby, aye
You played me like a tournament, baby, aye
You know I gave you the best of me, baby
Oh man, I thought you were next to me, baby
I guess I gotta show you I am the one that you were with
That got you swerving in the whip
And putting diamonds on your wrists, baby
Still making hit after hit, baby
I bet you'll let me hit after this

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison]
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Return of the Mack, yea
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go

Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, ""Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window""
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers

Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever

¿Como puede ser verdad?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical, the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical, the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical, the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Tropical, the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

14542,Expectations,Glaceo,"A pretty girl with a lit cigarette and a Led Zep t-shirt
Told me
""Don't read in this a one-night stand
Don't make no plans just hold me
Don't tell me that you love me when you just gonna run out of this bed in the morning
'Cause I don't see us sippin' coffee, no
I just see us taking off our clothes""
She said, ""I'm used to this by now
See, I've been getting used to being let down

And, baby, I've got expectations
That every guy just wants me naked
And every night we'll end up faking love
And, baby, I've made adaptations
From thinking love should come with patience
To knowing love's just something boy's made up""

And she said
""I'm pretty sure that you're just my type with your hat flipped backwards
Aw, yeah
Bet you like how I wear this dress, but it's better on my bedroom floor

In the morning
'Cause I don't see you growing on me, no
I just see us taking off our clothes

See you again

Yo
This is the owner of KungFood Restaurant
After I got broken into seven times
AceKing got broke into once, man
I ain't got no choice but to record this diss track
Aye last time I checked, Chinese in this country does have these constitutional rights
So, that's the beauty of music
I'm about to drop this bitch, go!

[Chorus]
San Francisco, that's my home
Let me put it in the song so you never get wrong
That's the city by the bay, that's where I grew up
No matter where I'm at that's this place I love

San Francisco, that's my homе
Let me put it in the song so you nеver get wrong
That's the city by the bay, that's where I grew up
No matter where I'm at that's this place I love

[Verse]
Now everybody let me see your hands in the air
Now throw your two middle fingers up to the mayor
I'm trying to run a business in the S.F.C
A punk-ass tweaker keep on messing with me

I'm just a man trying to provide for my son and my daughter
In the city with law and order, I'm barely making a quarter
Out of fifteen cent. It's hard to be a man
With crooked politicians want to see me getting burnt

Now London Breed, you ain't nothing but a clown
When we really needed you you would never be around
You done turned this great city into the zombie land
Lived through all kinds of dirts here- won't try in a small town

This just how I feel, I gotta keep it real
This ain't no fairy tale, my people are getting killed
You might be thinking I'm just another joke
You don't believe what I said, take a trip to the T.L

[Chorus]
San Francisco, that's my home
Let me put it in the song so you never get wrong
That's the city by the bay, that's where I grew up
No matter where I'm at that's this place I love

San Francisco, that's my home
Let me put it in the song so you never get wrong
That's the city by the bay, that's where I grew up
No matter where I'm at that's this place I love

[Verse]
You know I'm a hundred percent down with the Black Lives Matter
But what about our grandmother, what about our grandfather
They're getting attacked, they're getting robbed
They're getting killed and the DA just dropped another murder charge

I'm sick and tired of dealing with the phony-ass liberal
They acting like they care but never treated us as equal
My people been here for over two hundred years
So save your fake sympathy, your crocodile tears

I'm sick and tired of Asians being kicked onto the curb
Justice for Granpa Vicha, Little Jasper, never served
I wish I could be calling out all of their names
We ought to do whatever to make sure they didn't die in vain

Ain't nothing going to change if we remain silent
Now father please help us to stop all the violence
Now every night I pray to go back to the old day
When the bay was the greatest city in the whole states

If you are going to San Francisco
Make sure to leave nothing in your car

If you are going to San Francisco
Make sure you leave no money in your purse

To have your way
Would you give up
Or try again

Or play your role
Tell all the boys
Or keep it low

Would you turn away
Or play me off
Or would you say no

Dust yourself off and try again

I'm into you
You into me
But I can’t let it go so easily
Not 'til I see
What this could be
Be eternity, or just a week
You know our chemistry is off the chain
Is perfect now, but will it change
This ain’t a yes
This ain’t a no
Just do your thing
We'll see how it goes

If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

If you don’t wanna throw it all away
Might be shy on the first date
What about the next date
Oh, hoh, hoh, hoh
If you don’t wanna throw it all away
You might be buggin' on the first date
But what about the next date
Oh, hoh, hoh, hoh

If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

Making sure nobody knew
Trouble that we got into
Oooooh, oooh
Skinny dipping in the pool
Breaking all our made-up rules
Ooooh

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll make it I swear
'Cause we're halfway there
So let me take it, take it all the way
With my heart on my sleeve
In all honesty
There's something that I gotta gotta say

[Chorus]
Maybe I don't deserve it
But I'll give you all I got and I'll make it worth it
Rely on me and baby you won't be nervous
'Cause if we give it a shot then we could be perfect

[Bridge]
Baby you won't be nervous
'Cause if we give it a shot then we could be perfect

[Chorus]
Maybe I don't deserve it
But I'll give you all I got and I'll make it worth it
Rely on me and baby you won't be nervous
'Cause if we give it a shot then we could be perfect

Down to your toes, feather light
Cleanse your soul as we praise the night
I promise you - promise you we'll be alright

A little bit closer

Carry you like a wave

The wind gets colder
You can lean on my shoulder
We can go for longer
Carry you like a wave

Carry you like a wave

I found a haven in your arms
A helping hand close to my heart
Is this better? I need to know
Just promise me - promise me we'll be alright

I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

14512,Forever Young,UNDRESSD,"[Verse 1]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in the sandpit, life a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music played by me, the mad men

[Chorus]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever and ever young

[Verse 2]
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamond in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many advantages given up today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
Oh let them come true

[Chorus]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever and ever young

Forever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?

I thought I was a dreamer
But it's not a dream
I'm falling so much deeper
Into what is real
My eyes are open and I see it
I'm no longer blind
You lead the way out of this fever
Into a peace of mind

[Chorus]
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
And I know all the pain will be over
When you carry my weight on your shoulder
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
There's a light coming on the horizon
That forever will shine like a diamond
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above

[Verse 2]
Though that I was leaving
But I got stuck between your thighs
A different kind of freedom
I wait for you to shine
I be down in heavy breathing
Wind under your wings
Deeper for you my demon
My queen of everything
And it's slowly flowing through my body can you feel it

[Chorus]
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
And I know all the pain will be over
When you carry my weight on your shoulder
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
There's a light coming on the horizon
That forever will shine like a diamond
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
Fall asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day
Fall asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day

And I know all the pain will be over
When you carry my weight on your shoulder
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
There's a light coming on the horizon
That forever will shine like a diamond
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
Fell asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day
Fell asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day
Fell asleep living, wake up to

In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Blowin' outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
From the end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
(Tired of TV)
I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

The years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go)
You'll never shine if you don't glow (Hey)

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star

Marching in line like we've been TOLD

Keep staring down a highway made of GOLD
Picking up quick & moving FAST
Never looking down or looking back

Rolling thunder through the NIGHT

And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon
So sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we've
Got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change
The more they stay the same
Oh, don't you hesitate

Just go ahead
Let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere
Somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
Just relax, just relax
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes we feel afraid
But it's alright
The more you stay the same
The more they seem to change
Ooh, don't you think it's strange?

Tell me your favourite song
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead
Let your hair down

Pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Tell me your favourite song
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead
Let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere

That you loved me from the moment, it became clear that
I was gonna call you like I said I'd do

Carved our names into a stone
And we never felt alone as we walked hand in hand
There was hardly time for sorrow
Or thinking 'bout tomorrow
With liquor in a bottle of our favorite brand
I guess time was on our side
'Cause we're still not old and wise
We're still looking for a stone to carve our names
With our skin as a disguise
For our young mischievous eyes
The fire in our heart is still the same

We are young, at heart
We stay alive
We are strong, 'cause love
Will save our lives
And sure we're getting older, we get older
But that won't change a thing
'Cause life cannot control her, she gets older
But love will always win
We are young

14508,Nervous,Gavin James,"[Verse 1]
I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
When we loose our winter coats in the spring
'Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
That every time I see you my heart sings
'Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

[Hook]
Oooooooooh
Ooooohohoooooh
Oooohoooooooh
Ohoooohohohoooooh

[Verse 2]
'Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet no
I didn't know the words in front of me

[Bridge]
In front of me ooh
But I don't wanna know
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Home
If I let you go

[Hook]
Oooooohhhhh
Oooooohhhhh
Oooooohhhhh
Oooooooohooooohoohhhh

[Verse 3]
Now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love you if you don't
Oh you don't

[Outro]
Oooooohhhhh
So I won't say I love you if you don't

14504,Smile,Gorgon City,"[Verse 1]
The trees are stripped back
And the skies are dark winds
Oh when the leaves hit the ground
They take flight
Oh little one, don't cry for the winter
I know you're cold for a little while
See the mist in the distance linger
And you smile

[Chorus]
But you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile
Oh but you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile

[Verse 2]
Look at me in the cool breeze
Put my head high in the bright light
You know I pick up pace when I take lead
Another look in your eyes
Just us when the dust goes in
So keep close when the cold bites
Only wanna keep on holding
You smile

[Chorus]
But you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile
Oh but you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile

[Bridge]
(Smile)
I carry you away to a good place
I carry you
There's nothing in my way
Nothing in my way
But I carry you, oh, I carry you

[Chorus]
But you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile
Oh but you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile

[Outro]
When you smile
But you smile like everything's alright
Alright when you smile

Mă întreabă dacă sunt okay
Ești dulce și bună ca honey
Lasă-mă, lasă-mă să te
Ating, te sărut la chiloței
Adoră cum mi-o dau
Îți spune că mai vreau
O suge, o linge, gelato, vanilie, la masă șampanie, puțin caviar
Dansează samba
Ascunde marfa

Haide mișcă bine pe balans
Hai vino cu mine până acas'

Things that I can never do

Which way the wind blows

No, love don't wait in line

If I say
I don't care what you do with him

But I'll find the light

In those one night affairs
What I need is somebody who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world
World that I already
This time, call me baby
Actions speak louder than words

If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Come, my love is guaranteed

Words are so easy to say, but
You've got to show me love
You give me reason

14547,Galway Girl,Ed Sheeran,"[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shyin' away
I'll be comin' for your love, okay?

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumblin' away
Slowly learnin' that life is okay
Say after me
""It's no better to be safe than sorry""

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

My worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for

Under purple light
We stayed up all night
And we promised then, that we’d

Hold on to every word that we said
Replay every moment inside of our head

Savannah, I met you in the summer
I love your endless colours
I’ll always be your lover
Together we got faded
Still high on love, I taste it
Got in the pool butt naked
Where magic was created
I met you in the summer

I met you in the summer

When the heat is on
And we’re up till dawn
And you’re by my side
To kill the lonely nights
Just skin on skin
Under a thousand stars
And we promised there, that we’d

Hold on to every word that we said
Replay every moment inside of our head

14590,Tired,Henri Purnell,"Verse 1:
Name, calling out your name
Piercing hearts untamed
Wild undying fire, bites into your mane

You're mine, you're mine, you're mine
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Of all the shit I'm told, the ashes of my bones

Chorus
I won't play your silent games
Your fucked up ways that blind my faith

Your silent games, your silent games-

I beg -

Eyes that creep into my mind
With shaking feet unwind
Breathe, inhale, love building up inside

Of stories old untold
Hear me howling out my friends
Pick me up before I end

Your fucked up ways that blind my faith

Your silent games, your silent games-

14597,The Sun,Meynberg,"They say there's a sun in the sky
But me I can't imagine why
There might have been one
Before you were gone
But now all I see is the night
So I don't believe in the sun
How could it shine down on everyone?
And never shine on me?
How could there be..such cruelty?
The only sun I ever knew
As the beautiful one that was you
Since you went away it's nighttime all day
And it's usually raining too
So I don't believe in the sun
How could it shine down on everyone?
Never shine on me?
How could there be..such cruelty?
The only stars there really are
Were shining in your eyes
There is no sun except the one
That never shone on other guys
The moon to whom the poets croon
Has given up and died
Astronomy will have to be revised
So I don't believe in the sun
How could it shine down on everyone?
Never shine on me?
How could there be..such cruelty?

Who's poppin’, who's spittin'
Who's got it who's gettin'

V1: [R-SON]
Sing a song of six pence we about to croon
Out the wolf pack leading, howling at the moon
Ran to my gods and they grant me a boon
So I can keep on rocking till tomorrow afternoon

Keep it spicy as the sands of Dune
Stack with more flavor than a sack of macaroons
Dismiss the idea that Ran's a goon
'Cause my vocab will knock you out your pantaloons

A mixture of graffiti and Sanskrit runes
True school hip hop and old banjo tunes
Bringing in fans from all types of lands
And if you don't believe me just scan the room

Folks from Canada and Cameroon
West Bank, West Berlin, Westampton too
Home of the Koalas and the Kangaroos
They all wanna hear verses from those Randal dudes'

V2: [Dolio the Sleuth]
Haters stay hatin' but we really can't relate
Because we get so many positive vibrations
At every station that we stop, It's verified we're making it hot
Find the right spot we're taking it out

Unclassified flows you can't place in a box
Except the ones with the boom in it
Leave a little room for the movement of feet
Feel the groove when we speak
Show and prove, how we do what we do on a beat

In the booth with the heat, let loose on the street
Socialize like a Sunday afternoon in the East
When it's brunch time, get it in when it's crunch time
With metaphors galore, similes and some punch lines

Three crowd-rockers, D-R squared
If you're asking where the party is, we are there
Get live at any scene, we done seen our share
And pay no mind to naysayers, yo
We need not care

Say woah-oh-oh (Woah-oh-oh!)
Woah-oh-oh (Woah-oh-oh!)
Woah-oh-oh
We're just doing our own thing

Yeah, I'm different, yeah I'm different
With a mic and I'm backed by live instruments
With a boom bap or with a whole band
I command crowds and push the envelope like a postman

Known to bring the heat to this cold land
Unique with the flavor
'cause the ones who seem to eat can be so bland
Seasoned on the mic, yep! Feedin' off the vibes, yep!
The reason that I'm nice, 'cause there's freedom in my mind, yep!

Never picked a lane, I went off-road
Put in some elbow grease and dirtied up my washed clothes
The opposite of hostile, 'cause I'm not a lost soul
I was given a gift, not a sock of hot coal

Yo I watched a lot fold like tacos, all jokes aside
When people say that I'm dope, it keeps my hope alive
Because I heard a lot of ""Nope"" for most my life
So now I get a dose of pride knowing my flow is nice

Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies

Right in the corner of his eye
Eases his metal minding heart on cherry beer
Tellin' crap sidewalk stories
Tryin' to get back in the middle of the road
I says we're halfway there
Man, I don't care
I don't give a shit
And I never will
Jintro and the great luna
And a broken man and a wronged wife
A twisted soul
And one more call for alcohol
Mingo mango
This is the day of doom
Spit your fire
I'll go down soon
But ain't you gonna tell me what you
Want me to do about wantin' you
Oh, baby
What ya want me to do

Oh, baby, every morning in my head the
Skies are sad and the sun comes up
And blinds my eyes from behind
Jintro's mad, Jintro's sad
Jintro's got a broken head

Takes his broken min to bed

Oh, baby, I wish we never met

14552,Better Than This,REZarin,"Two Tone:
Aye
It's gotta be better than this
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this
Much better than the life that we love
Aye, Aye
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this
Than this

Days seem longer in the summer time
I done told these niggas that the summers mine
Niggas moving forward fast -- we don’t press rewind
So Ima need y’all to catch me if I don’t fall In line
And I don’t mean that shit like single file
And after five years a nigga single now
But even after all of this shit
Still love the mother of both of my kids
I still regret all the time that I miss
I still regret everything that I did
Apologies everything that I hid
And it’s all because of a life I tried to live
I heard life is what ever that you make it
And once it’s made it’s impossible to change it nigga
Cause even if you manage to change -- all the memories remain the same
I want it so bad in a strong way
I even considered doin it the wrong way
Brighter days seem outta sight in a long way
Until then nigga ima let this song play

Aye, Aye
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this
Than this

Nights seem longer then the winter time
A nigga broke so at times I miss dinner time
I ain’t even trippin though, long as my babies eat
Long as I got my vape smoke then that’s fine with me
I think I got my family all worried
I’m losing my sense of sight this shit is scary nigga
Better yet this shit blurry
I’m at the point where anything I do can hurt me
I pray to God that my vision don’t desert me
A crazy man is the last thing that this Earth needs
And California just ain’t giving me what I need
And when I cry it be feelin' like my eyes bleed
My little cousin told me I need to find peace
Buried his brother now I wonder if we find peace
Somebody tell me something better in this life please
Somebody tell me isomething better after life please

Aye, Aye
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this
Than this
Much better than the life that we love
Aye, Aye
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this
Than this


Terayle:
Aye, Aye, Look
Now have you ever felt a spirit transition into another dimension
My older brother put me in that position
I was lookin at a body that’s stale
Another body that’s frail
Another wound – prolly never gon’ heal
Now this that same brother used to judo-flip me the yard
Same brother showed me really how to really play my cards
Same brother showed hard work from the jump
Can’t front – me and him switchin' places all I want
I remember - December’s with little heat
So we watching Boondocks in jackets and tube socks
Playing video games every night
Throwing rocks on Webb Street
And now I’m steady livin' in hell
Now how the fuck I’m 'sposed to live when my older brother gone
He had his life together — I was livin 'wrong
And even when it’s quiet and I’m prayin' and I’m crying for his Presence 9 times outta 9, I’m alone
Shit, it’s been a minute since I seen your face
Or heard your voice
Or smelled your scent
And I ain’t even talk to God cause I can’t rejoice
I don’t repent
I make the choice to often sin
I miss my dog, I miss my kin, I miss my boy
I miss my friend, the time we spent — Imma never get it
The book of your life came to a close
But I guess another story begins
I gotta take it in stride — cause every lesson applies
And every single tear I cried it eventually dried
Reminiscing on the times I was contemplating life
Now my brother is the reason that I’m staying alive
And that’s ironic because I probably spent too many hours staring at pills
I’d probably be a goner is lookin' could really kill
And now I feel ridiculous — looking at my sisters and my mother in The eyes thanking God they who I am healing with - uh
But I don’t fuckin' get it
Man, Tevyn really gone I need fucking with it
Feelin' life was getting harder and I want to quit it
Man I swear to God in that fucking minute
He came to me
My brother came to me
It was almost like he sang to me
Yeah he sang to me
He gave his little brother advice to take the drive and the mental combined
Engineer my blue print, and I can sketch the design
Investigate you inner spirits and the realm of my mind
Before I know it, I can fill a storage unit with finds
Play the game like a coach and I'll never resign
Be a bully in this bitch, ain't no need to be kind
You fuck around and act sweet, you gon end up behind
But play your lucky stars right and you might end up aligned
Cause you can really have it all — you gotta get up and grind
But that won’t take away the pain — I'll keep that in mind
Cause hen I call my brothers name I just want a reply
I just really want him back, i ain’t wanna goodbye
I tell you I don’t know why I don’t know why


Two Tone:
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this
Much better than the life that we love
(It's gotta be better than this)
And I know it's gotta be better than this
It's gotta be better than this
Than this
(I know, I know)
It's gotta be better than this
Than this, yeah
(Aye)
I know

You know I had to do it again
(I was gonna leave it out)
Better than this

14594,"Money, Power",Silky Signs,"[Verse 1: Fabolous]
They call me F-A-Beezy, sometimes Stizzo
The wrist on freezy, neck on glizzo
The coupe move easy at two-double-izzo
Truck look cheezy [?]
And it's jacked up like it sit on stilettos
Can't you see the glit' on the pebbles that sit on the bezel
None of you little scraps couldn't get on my level
Take more than a hot song to try to sit on the devil
Got respect when I killed ""Money, Power"" the first time
When they tried to knock down the towers the first time
And the only reason I'm talking 'bout it
Is so you know the real talk of New York's about it
I'm with a bitch, with a tight ass that shakes
Her suck game will one gulp: White Castle shakes
Got the home right past the lake
When I came home they stop us, this time might blast the jake
I'm the nigga on the couches in clubs
And I stand out from the rest of the slouchers and scrubs
Bottles and bottles with a train of pretty hoes
That look like they could be the mains in videos
We in the caps with the Yankee logos
Blowing on the stanky dro dro, the pinky snow-globe
And you know the link be so ""oh""
Niggas look fast but the blinks be slow-mo
I could spot a kinky ho though
All hood bitch, she just tryna make you think she SoHo
Plus I know the game like the back of my hand
When I'm lazy, you can catch me in the back of sedans
When I'm gone, you can bet I'm coming back with a tan
With the Mickey D signs on the back of my pants
And I act like the man, 'cause this my time
Plus the hood say they miss my dimes, it's young money

[Verse 2: Ransom]
All you see me with is Coogi, dogs and long chains
Fucking with some bougie broads with long brain
Plus now I'm usually calm, the storm came
But still keep a toolie on like John Wayne
Catch me in the kitchen, dope bricks on the fire
Them niggas that be spittin, those pricks is some liars
Never been pitchin, sold clips to them buyers
Me? I hang on the block like broke kicks on the wire
The kid is so nasty with it
Copped a new Benz and only paid half to get it
I'm a gorilla that had to get classy with it
Your dumb bird gave me head because Fab was with us
Could care less who your bitch be feeling
I'm in a loft with nice floors and crispy ceiling
As long as I get it off and get these millions
I retire to smoke weed like Ricky Williams

[Verse 3: Hitchcock]
Now your cake is gone, niggas wanna hate the Storm
Cause they know my team reign surpreme, and I'm Jason Bourne
Catch a case Im gone, just another face to mourn
Stay down 'fore the tre-pound leave your face deformed
Listen pal, you ain't really pitching vials
Just wanna rap back and forth like 'Kiss and Styles
Every other day, you could say I be switching dials
Fourty-grand, fifty-thou, and I got the fifty-cal
It's Hitchcock, Hannibal of rap
You ain't gotta see a show to see an animal attack
Im an animal a warrior in fact
With tre snubs, repping A-dub in the corner with gats
And Im in a fast car, with a crash bar
Built in the dash part sorta like Nascar
Outlast yall because I treat the track like a cell phone
I burn it down to the last bar

[Verse 4: Stack Bundles]
You're welcome
You ain't gotta thank me for what i did to the mixtapes
Make sure the labels get my shit straight
You ain't gotta pat me on the back (back!)
Just pack me in that 'Bach ('Bach!)
With a dime, fine wine and some blinds in the back
Curtains is too extra
Though the silk shirt's fucking with my chest hairs
I'm in love with the texture
The gorgeous one has spoken, clear stones in his hair
Pink in his eyes like Jesus has awoken
It's all in the belt buckle, a mansion in that
And if you call shorty, buckle, just imagine the neck
And the trousers Mugler, the shoes is Maury
These rap niggas startin to bore me
Most MCs square, so the button-up's MC squared
I'm insulted when they offer me ears
The babes want me in [?]
And you know the boys want me in states
I'm retiring pyrex - call me Seymour Cake!

[Verse 5: Joe Budden]
Now niggas say they in the hood like Mister Softee
They in the hood getting treated like Mister Softie
“I clap the four-fifth”, if you believe that
Then you believe Rick James died of natural causes
I'm twisting up trees-chronic to switching up ebonics
Started in the fifth grade, switching up etonics
Know a few dudes that'll spit at your dome
So go see 'em if you really want invisible stones
Try and get at me to hit him
Just type forty acres and a mule in your navi system
My hood—they kidnapping your kids
See, we try and Tom Cruise and Jamie what collateral is
Whack dudes in the game is a problem
But they like Maurice Malone jeans, their name will stay on the bottom
Murdering that? Nah, heard him, he's sub-par
Coyote Ugly rappers, keep working at your bars

[Verse 6: Paul Cain]
Cain got the heart of a soldier, mind of a general
Strategy is important, timing is critical
We wear tracks out, lyrically I'm a beast
From Brooklyn's backbone, epitome of the streets
Only the strong survive, if you physically weak
You get gunbutted, stabbed, shot, and critically beat
'Cause listen, ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
Presidential with the matching bullet bracelet, it's a good look, man
Call me whatever, I hustle and I rap a little
You see the color stones chain look like a pack of Skittles
I give 'em anthrax, every bar is that official
I know I'm a gangster, I ain't got to pack a pistol
I don't rap in riddles, I give it to a nigga
Straight, no chaser, I'm like Hen' on the rocks
If it ain't the fifth, it's probably the Glock
I'm the nigga Clue and Duro call when they need the bodies to drop
If it ain't the chain, it's probably the watch
When I ride if it ain't the truck or sedan, it's probably the drop
Play the block, I don't party a lot
I'm the one who sent the goon with the snub to get the jewels from the club
I could never blow all my dough
When I get at least ten people robbed at all my shows
And all I know: money, clothes, birds, and cars
Running from Po's, champagne, furs, and R's
Quite sure you must've heard of the God
If not I'm Cain, Triangle Offense, I'm a third of the squad
I'm the first line of the defense, the star point guard
Is back starting, y'all be used to riding the bench
[?] fuck that ""no women, no kids"" shit
When the shotty blows, everybody goes, business is business
But dig this, fuck a guilty conscience
I'll put a slug in you, really give you something to live with
Fuck street fighting, I pull a hammer in a split second
The kid breathe fire, and speak lightning
These niggas ain't writing
All they did was analyze my flow, and use my style so their liking, nigga

[Outro: Paul Cain]
Now the year's new, I laid my game flat
I want my spot back, take two, motherfucker

14589,Kiss Me,Robert Falcon,"[Verse 1]
Kiss me out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You'll wear those shoes and I will wear the dress

[Chorus]
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift you open hand, strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance, steal the moon's sparkling
So kiss me

[Verse 2]
Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me, upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

[Chorus]
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift you open hand, strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance, steal the moon's sparkling
So kiss me

[Outro]
Kiss me out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You'll wear those shoes and I will wear the dress
Kiss me, so kiss me
So kiss me, kiss me
So kiss me, kiss me
So kiss me, kiss me

14598,Sunrise,On June,"[Verse 1]
Monday morning, saw my darling
Out the window, where leaves were falling
Went outside and started talking
'Til the evening, the sun was falling

[Pre-Chorus]
I pulled her towards me in that moment
Yeah, we don't care if the record player's broken

[Chorus]
So groove, groove in the moonlight
Just me and you tonight
Now move your body with mine
And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

[Verse 2]
[?] now we started driving
On the highway, when cars were honking
We pulled over, started walking
People dancing and traffic stopping

[Pre-Chorus]
I pulled her towards me in that moment
Yeah, we don't care if the car radio's broken

[Chorus]
So groove, groove in the moonlight
Just me and you tonight
Now move your body with mine
And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

[Bridge]
So groove, groove in the moonlight
Just me and you tonight
Now move your body with mine
And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

Now move your body with mine
And we gon' dance until the sunrise
Until the sunrise

14588,Believe,ROOKIES,"[Intro]

While she lays sleeping
I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone

[Verse 1]

I write my songs while she sleeps in my bed
Countless subjects and lyrics created in my head
Me and her are friends with benefits at most
We do a lot of action, but I don't like to boast
She's a woman that's so popular and all that
I'm just a young man who just happens to rap
But we both know our music can a lot of good
I'd spend all my time with her if I could


But whilst the two of us do get lovey and playful
I don't want an attraction, 'cause I know it could be fatal
One day, this girl could accidentally put me under 6 feet
It happened to all her exes before she met me
But I can't help but feel this way about her
Been so long, I can't picture my life without her
Even when I have to leave her behind quick snap
I know she'll wait for me to come running back

[Hook]

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong

But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I will find a way
Find a way

[Verse 2]

Oh my goodness, how I love her so much
She's the one girl that I put in all my trust
She knows what's next in the world like scripted plays
I love it when she takes my hand through her wicked ways
She hugs and kisses me whenever I make an entrance
She holds my heart captive like a prison sentence
There's no more fears, no more tears, no more lies
And there's no worries inside, when I look in her eyes

I love her so much, there's really no pretending
I press hands and pray for us to have a happy ending
When the curtain to our lives close and we take a bow
I hope we die together with no sorrow, pain or feeling down
We're such a cute couple together, yeah I know
I knew ever since I met her, 4 years ago
We hold each other's pain & such like carriers
If I get richer than I am now, maybe I'll marry her

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

With her, life feels a little less awful
My love for her will never die, it's immortal
I want her for life, and I'm being serious
This is a feeling I never thought I'd experience
The love she has for me does nothing but fulfil me
If she leaves me, the heartbreak will surely kill me
She's a work of art to me like something from David Hayes
She always adds a little sunshine to my rainy days

And this is me far from playing
This is my heart and dedication to her that I'm displaying
It feels as though we need each other for survival
If we die inside, there'll always be a revival
To spend my time with her feels rather vital
Until 'the girl of Rootes' becomes her title
With her by my side, I know I'll achieve my dreams
I love you, hip hop, and I know that you believe in me

[Hook 2]

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I will find a way
While she waits
While she waits
For me

14570,Photograph,Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
Mm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""

I keep on dancing, I don't wanna know
The world outside
There is a rhythm beating in our hearts
You can't deny

[Pre-Chorus]
So give your love, let it out
Let it be, I don't mind
Give all you got, don't be shy

Give all you got to me now

Getting on a plane with a morning sun
Baby, let's pretend that it's all forgotten
I don't wanna stay where our love went wrong
I just wanna dance, wanna dance

14643,Feeling,Lucas Estrada,"[Verse 1]
I don't know who you are
But i know we got something
Going on for to long
For this to be nothing
No rush, there’s no fuzz
Play cool and feel the vibe
Even if we are strangers (mmm)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now set it of, i need you close
Shut the blinds, nobody knows
The hour passed, and all along
You might be more, than just someone
That all goes slowly, still there is a question mark
Even if we are strangers (mmm)

[Chorus]
I'm having a feeling, are you feeling it, feeling it
Some kind of tension, like we're dancing with a loaded gun
I’m having a feeling
I'm having a feeling
That we got something
Going on, going on

I don't know what we do, but it sure feels pleasant
There is something about you, it's more than just messing
No rush, there's no fuzz
Play cool and feel the vibe
Even if we are lovers (mmm)

Don't wanna think, don't wanna know

14642,Turn You Down,NLSN,"[Verse 1]
On the same page, we never settle down
Make eyes at each other, keep each other around
It's strange, I was leaving town
But you’d never make me turn you down
Save face, had the time to get out
Agreed to it all, never had any doubt
No chase, we ain't together now
But I'd never turn you down

[Chorus]
We, never ever, showed the real us from the start
Only we know (We know)
We, we are, we are the lead in this whole part
Don’t think I love you, but I love us
And I ain't gonna turn you down
I ain't gonna turn you down
Well I ain't gonna turn you down

[Verse 2]
We were so late, to the party
How did you fall so hard without telling me now?
It's great, but even better somehow
If I don't have to turn you down
Can't wait, you're throwing the towel
And I’m not really sure love is running this town
Have faith, no, I’ll never
No, I'll never turn you down

[Chorus]
We, never ever, showed the real us from the start
Only we know (We know)

I ain't gonna turn you down
Well I ain't gonna turn you down

Was it so hard, you driving me insane?
Never loved me from the beginning, oh
Never wanted more from the beginning, oh-oh
There was never us, it was just about when we did it
It was just about when we did it, no
I ain’t ever gonna turn you down
I ain't ever gonna turn you down
I ain't ever gonna turn you down

[Chorus]
We, never ever, showed the real us from the start
Only we know (We know)

14608,Shot,Wave Wave,"[Verse 1]
I need, a little bit to make my mind go hush
You want, someone that can make your body blush
We ain't been drinking the same
And I don't even know your name
But I don't want nobody else, body else

'Cause I love the way your body moves me, oh
The liquor's pouring, and my eyes adore you
I need to take a shot with you, with you

Zoned out, tripping over lines that I could say
Girl, the way that you look is insane
And if I could just pick your brain
You wouldn't want nobody else, body else

'Cause I love the way your body moves me, oh
The liquor's pouring, and my eyes adore you

I guess that I've been missing you

Or dreamin' that some day we'll be something

Waiting for my luck to turn around
I'm hopeful or hopeless, everything is blurry
It's easy to get lost when you're

Dreaming that some day we'll be something
We'll be something
More than a feeling but life keeps giving me lemons
Giving me lemons

I've been waiting for good news all day
I've been waiting for you to look my way
I've been waiting for good news all day, all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me feel something, something, something
Something about you
You make me feel something, something, something
Something about you

[Chorus]
There's something about, something about you
There's something about, something about you (There's something about you)
There's something about you
There's something about you

There's something about you
There's something about, something about you

14618,Orange Juice,Henri Purnell,"[Verse 1]
It's so easy to pretend
Pretend that we are only friends
But now I think it has to end
Because it really makes no sense

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna drown
But we sunk too deep, sunk too deep
We should slow it down
I'm losing sleep, cannot sleep
We can fool around
That's what I seek, what I need
But I don't think it's working out
But I don't think it's working out

[Chorus]
I brought you some orange juice
'Cause I wanna break up with you
There is nothing you can do
And I don't wanna talk this through
I just wanna break up with you
At least I brought you orange juice

[Drop]
I wanna break up with you
At least I brought you orange juice

[Verse 2]
I won't forget the time we spent
Although it was way too intense
It's not your fault, it's self-defense
I know it really makes no sense

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna drown
But we sunk too deep, sunk too deep
We should slow it down
I'm losing sleep, cannot sleep
We can fool around
That's what I seek, what I need
But I don't think it's working out
But I don't think it's working out

I brought you some orange juice
'Cause I wanna break up with you
There is nothing you can do
And I don't wanna talk this through

Whenever I'm with you
It feels like I'm floating
You move the seas, it's all for me
You know it's true
And when I'm without you
It feels like I'm drowning
I'm recklessly and hopelessly
Chasing after you

[Chorus]
And this feels like magic
It's so automatic
No one makes me feel the way that you do
When I'm alone with you, yeah
When I'm alone with you, yeah
When I'm alone with you, yeah

[Verse 2]
You are the one that I wanted
I hope that you know this
I'm following the way you lead
You know it's true
And I'm counting the moments
Until I can see you
I'm stuck on you the way you move
I'm running after you

And this feels like magic
It's so automatic

For every dreamer there's a sky
For every low there is a high
For every dancer there's a floor
For every less we try more

[Chorus]
We build bridges out of walls
And we tear our shelters down
It's up to us if we rise or if we fall
This is our trip we just have to find a road
It's always been
A tale of rise and fall
A tale of rise and fall
A tale of rise and fall

[Verse 2]
For every stranger there's a home
For every king there's a throne
From every nightmare we awake
We won't get caught
In the decisions that we make

14627,Strangers,GAB,"[Verse 1: Zumbi]
I’m a stranger in a home I own
Been livin’ here twenty long years with my fam like a Corleone
But where did everybody go that I used to know?
I moved in back in ‘Eighty-Four’
We was very ‘poor’ -- wasn’t even sellin’ gold weight
Just movin’ in to the Gold State
I reminisce about the closed gate
That seemed to wrap around
The music that we made
It had a ghetto sound
Most cats was black and brown, in Urban areas
Was so infectious that it spread out like Malaria
New York to Cali, back to the Dirty-Dirty
We used to be sixteen, but now we pushing thirty
I seen it change early, I pulled a Jheri-Curly
On out to dready, but the next phase we wasn’t ready
It seemed enlightened as the years got longer
From black to white but the sales got stronger
We started going platinum, it was bound happen
We went pop, sleeping in beds of silk and satin
When I woke up from my sleep, pronounced
Saw the whole scene had changed, all my folks had bounced
But I ain’t leaving, ‘cause I own this block
Been paying off my mortgage steady with my bonds and stock
I be buying property, till I own the block
I love hip-hop, it’s all I got

[Chorus]
There’s a stranger in my home
And he’s watching
Yeah...Yeah...Yeah
There’s a Stranger in my home
And he’s watching

[Verse 2: Gift of Gab]
There’s a stranger in my home, my house has been invaded
Went out for just a second
Came back - it ain’t the same as it was
At times I felt, could leave the door unlocked
And let all come and go as they please
But knowing that was there
When I had left, was there when I returned
New faces, replications, some styles that they have learned
Like Greeks had did Egyptians - Complex to simplified
I suddenly realized: My cribs been gentrified
And if people don’t know, then how could people come
Big money - neglect the hood, suburban promotion
From urban emotion to corporation
Who really don’t have a clue where they got they taste from
There’s a stranger in my home and my peoples is gone
And I’m feeling like the outsider standing alone
There’s a stranger in here, but the strangest thing to see
Is the way it’s looking right now, the stranger is me

[Chorus]
There’s a stranger in my home
And he’s watching
Yeah...Yeah...Yeah
There’s a Stranger in my home
And he’s watching

[Verse 3: Zumbi]
There’s a stranger in my home
Infiltrating my throne
Stop messing with my crib
Won’t leave me alone
There’s a stranger, it’s danger, the call of hip-hop culture
When you’re feeling hot, when you’re not she’s a vulture
Know that we’re supposed to protect and respect
But it’s hard to stay righteous when you needing a check
There’s a stranger in my midst
Now I’m balling my fist
I never dreamed it would come to this

[Outro Hook]
There is so much to me, so they’re following me everywhere I go
I don’t know what to do, but I gotta stay true
There’s a stranger in my home
There’s a stranger in my home
And he’s watching
(Yeah...Yeah...Yeah)
There’s a Strange...

14632,On Your Own,Y.V.E. 48,"[Verse 1]
I thought you could die by loneliness
But my heart is gone, love lost
And I'm feeling blessed

Empty car on a full road
No map, don't know how to get home
Navigate yourself by starlight
Once again I spend a lonely night
Looking up at the sky, dream big but realize
It's really all only in your mind
Every time you're loving blind
So don't be getting confused
You're on your own till love is a loose
Don't last for long, smile kids
Just dyes a face, lost bliss
Before you know, you're on your own again
Looking at pictures all alone again
Past memories float away
[?] in the river not here to say
Shouted past dream and making you pay
Been on the same road for so many days
Blinded by the headlight
It's time to get your head right

[Chorus]
It's time to get your head right
(Get your head right, get your head right)

[Verse 2]
I'm tired all the time
But you know I could never sleep
Lay awake the whole damn night
Memories stuck on repeat
Looking out the window
Thinking about the times I didn't show
Should've cried and let me know
If I ever thought I was letting you go

I rather you tear me apart
And smile and say you need a new start
Sleepless nights with nowhere to go
So much effort when nothing to show
Tell me why I laugh, why I cry
If the next day you don't know why
Why I laugh, why I smile
If the next day your lover's going by

See for me sometimes lately
Think I'm best on my own maybe
Double bed, one pillow no lately
Knows my heart, can feel that you hate me
Please forgive me for all my ignorance
Love lost, I left it in past tense
(In past tense, in past tense)

[Chorus]
It's time to get your head right
(Get your head right, get your head right)

Hey - these flowers are way out of season!
You'll fly to a swamp planet, meet a little green man
And move big heavy things with your mind!

Uh yeah baby oooooooh, listen to me, oh yeaaaah

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit

The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or boy-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin ""Ay papi!""
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start

Bitches screamin they want That old thing back
Like B I Double G I E
Wit some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known to bustin in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love and hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to come the ghetto is crazy
How come you ain't, ?? semi your faces
When I come you be cryin like I'm killin ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin I got my swagger back
I'm lookin like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit...

Is my mind playin tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot
But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em
And if I'm caressin em, I'm undressin em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin fantasies without that nigga Mr. Walk
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin for an intermission
Fuck the kissin, lickin down to your belly button, I ain't frontin
They don't call me B.I.G. for nuttin, all of a sudden

14661,Safe and Sound,WUSA,"(If I only said lame shit about war I'd be OK)
Political Correctness has become a plague
Everyones feelings are hurt all the time
Stop trying to dictate what I do and say
If I'm so bad, go back to mom and dads

Safe and sound
(I'm sick of modern art in a hardcore scene)
I'm not intolerant
I just don't give a fuck!
Tell the message boards how much I suck
""you can't say that, it's too offensive
Even though you know I never meant it
The sensitive youths need a place to hide""
Well sorry dudes, you're not my kind
Complain because you're bored
And senseless offensive

Hey, your love is like a summer rain
That brought me back to life again
On the dry lands of my heart, you washed away the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Now there’s a rhinestone river and it takes me to the sea
The million lights that shimmer when it’s dark inside of me
Before I grow dimmer and I die and go to sleep
I wanna say these words to you tonight

Let’s take tonight and make it for life
We’re singing, oh
Baby, tonight, I’ll say it right, let’s make it for life

Until you came and lit your flame
You brought back the colors to my destiny

Siempre me despierto sola, pero hoy
Tengo ganas de algo más
Y yo quiero preparar la mesa para dos
Salir de la mano, que llegó el verano

La tierra se nos calentó
Y derritió esa convicción
De que solo es mejor
Y ahora quiero oír violines y un amor como en el cine

Dime, si hay calor, ¿por qué quiero que tú me abrigues?
¿Por qué reacciono al sol con ganas de tu boca de sal?
Un romance en el mar
Quiero quе seas la ola que nunca se va
Quе tú seas la ola (Que tú seas la ola, ah)
Que, esta vez, se queda (Que, esta vez, se queda, ah)
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verso 2]
Hace mucho tiempo que soy sólo yo
Tengo ganas de algo más
Que cuando me suene el teléfono (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Venga un ""te quiero"", un ""sin ti, me muero"" (Ah, ah)

It's not lonely
It's a necessary thing
It's a place I made up
Find out what I'm made of
The nights I've stayed up
Counting stars and fighting sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it wash over me
Ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reveals life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

[Chorus]
Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day
It gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell each other secrets
And remember how to love

(There's a place I go to)
(Find out what I'm made of)

[Verse 2]
There's a place I'm going
No one knows me
If I breathe real slowly
Let it out and let it in
It can be terrifying
To be slowly dying
Also clarifying
The end where we begin

[Pre-Chorus]
So let it wash over me
I'm ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reveals life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

[Chorus]
Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day
It gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell each other secrets
And remember how to love

Say that you want me now
Need you to know me

[Verso 1: Mon Laferte & El David Aguilar]
Si alguna vez nos volvemos a ver caminamos un rato
Será bonito encontrarnos de nuevo con tanto pasado
Seguramente habrá un sitio que pueda ponernos al tanto
Dejando atrás la forma en que esto un día terminó

[Verso 2: Mon Laferte & El David Aguilar]
Si alguna vez nos volvemos a ver abracemos la suerte
Y si nos toca esa luna menguante nos damos el chance
De contemplarla como aquella vez en la banca de un parque
Para que no quepa duda de que fue un hermoso amor

[Estribillo: Mon Laferte & El David Aguilar]
Tanta cosa buena que viví te quiero agradecer
Porque hasta en la pena en que me vi la puedo comprender
Si nosotros algún día, cuanto no recordaría, todo lo que te diría

[Verso 3: Mon Laferte & El David Aguilar]
Si alguna vez nos volvemos a ver nos reímos de todo
Y sin contarnos la historia de cómo salimos del hoyo
Al fin y al cabo nos haría falta tan solo mirarnos
Para que no quepa duda de que fue un hermoso amor

Tanta cosa buena que viví te quiero agradecer
Porque hasta en la pena en que me vi la puedo comprender
Si nosotros algún día, cuanto no recordaría, todo lo que te diría

Yesterday, when I was almost home
There were people standing right outside my door
And my lady was lying on the floor, on the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, not a single word had come out of my mouth
I just stepped outside and I headed south
Me and my old shoes and this old fashioned blues
That I sent for you

[Chorus]
I turned my back and I walked into the night
No looking back to whatever I left behind
I didn’t wave goodbye, I didn’t even wave goodbye
I turned my back and I walked a million miles
Under the burning sun and the blinding light
I didn’t wave goodbye, I didn’t even wave goodbye

[Verse 2]
I grabbed my stuff, it was really tough
I slipped out and didn’t even close the door
Nothing left to close the door for

Yeah, not a single word had come out of my mouth
I just stepped outside and I headed south
Me and my old shoes and this old fashioned blues

La vida nos cruzó
De un modo muy casual
Llegaste como el Sol
Robándome la sombra de forma gradual

Cualquier fuga de luz
Todo era una señal
Diez pasos hacia ti
Mil dudas sobre mi
Y el miedo natural

Me hacías temblar así (Me hacías temblar así)
Como la luna sobre el agua
Y entonces me solté (Y entonces me solté)
Para abrazarme a tu mirada
Y así te descubrí (Y así te descubrí)
Pero en un beso fue que yo te conocí

Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh, diez pasos hacia ti
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh

Y la emoción de tus movimientos pura pasión
Letal combinación pa' mi corazón

Cuando tu besas quitas mi veneno
No importa el lugar cuando tu estas
No falta mas si nos tenemos

Tu boca que apura el licor
Bendita sea la cruel quemadura de tu piel que madura
Y tu beso que cura y sutura el dolor
Y es que créeme cuando te digo que no necesito mas que el cariño que me das cuando estas conmigo
Por fin yo he encontrado mi botín, y es que cuando estoy contigo el mundo entero es un jardín

Cuando tu me tocas me activas reflejos
Por ningún motivo quiero sentirte lejos
No importa el lugar en donde estas si estar contigo es lo que quiero

Ya que siempre tienes falda pero no ropa interior
Me aventuro entre tus piernas, siéntate en el comedor
Con la mirada en tus ojos el olor y el sabor de tu servo la vida se pasa mejor
Con la mirada en tus ojos el olor y el sabor de tu piel la vida se pasa mejor (Oh)

Qué sabrosa sensación
Se acelera el corazón

Era viernes y noche de amigas
Se cruzo tu mirada y la mía
Y no supe decir no porque
Porque en esa situación el tequila a mí me pone peligrosa

Esa cosquillita que no se me quita

Qué tienes tú

Si tengo que hacer fila yo me formo
Ya ven acércate, cállate y bésame

14736,Hablar de Ti,Gepe,"Me gustan tus ojos azules
Me encanta tu pelo que es como una nube
Que ha llovido tanto que no tiene nada más que ocultar

Me encanta tu boca que dice que sabe
Entiende y perdona los sabios y giles
Que han comido tanto que han agotado su voluntad de querer

Me gusta que uses la palabra amigo
Cuando quiero estar un rato contigo
No hay ningún secreto que guarde conmigo sin preguntar

Me encanta sentir así tu respiro
Abriéndose paso al invierno tan frío
En un mundo gigante, cambiante y jodido es bueno sentirse así

Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti pa´ siempre
Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti

Me gustan tus ojos azules
Tu mente que acepta las desilusiones
El tiempo que pasa nos va dejando libres para estar mejor

Me encanta la fuerza que tu cuerpo tiene
Para conseguir lo que tuvo y que quiere
Mujer consecuente ahora y siempre hasta la final

Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti pa´ siempre
Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti

Yo sé que no hay nada tan importante como verte otra vez
Solo sé que mi mano y boca te aprietan muy fuerte
Que de vez en cuando nos pegamos de frente
No hay nada más que pensar y mirar de cerca y sentir

Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti pa´ siempre
Me encanta esa manera en ti
Me gusta tanto que puedo quedarme a hablar sobre ti

Me gustan tus ojos azules
Me encanta tu pelo que es como una nube
Que ha llovido tanto que no tiene nada más que ocultar

Me encanta la fuerza que tu cuerpo tiene
Para conseguir lo que tuvo y que quiere
Mujer consecuente ahora y siempre hasta la final

[Verso 1]
Camino solo a mi destino
Pretendo no buscar cariño
Pero tu llegas de repente
Con tus aires inocentes
Y me antojas de soñar

[Verso 2]
Me dices quédate conmigo
Vamos a amanecer los dos juntitos
Y luego me hablas de tus planes
De tus miedos incesantes
Y me empiezo a enamorar

[Coro]
Ay me dejé enredar por ti
Como un idiota
Subí hasta el cielo y me caí
Ay que dolor
Ya lo que pasó entre los dos
Se fugó en la historia
Porque así mismo
Como llegaste
Te me fuiste

[Interlude]
Porqué te me fuiste guapita? (Cesar)
Y Por qué me dejaste cuando mas te quería? (Lunale)

[Verso 3]
Que voy a hacer estoy perdida
Y yo que estaba tan tranquila
Pero llegaste a ilusionarme
Descarado a engatusarme
Y te vas así nomas

Ay me dejé enredar por ti
Como un idiota
Subí hasta el cielo y me caí
Ay que dolor
Ya lo que pasó entre los dos
Se fugó en la historia
Porque así mismo

Ay me dejé enredar por ti

Let love guide us through the rain

When you cold, only love makes you warm again
Only love heals a broken heart, we been through
It all girl, came through the storm again
Find your joy, let go of the past
Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free
I'll never let you fall, let's go, girl you can trust in me

I love the hustle but I love you more
Ride or die that's what love is for
Believe it or not, God loves us all
When I was down and out
You were down with me
Things got deep, you'd drown with me
If there was heat, I know you'd cock back
Click, clap, spit a round with me
Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me
To all them haters, they can come get and me
It's us against the world, 150 I love Miami
That's my city, 305

14749,Canela en Rama,El Kanka,"Yo, que nunca supe llegar a mí hora
Hoy me quedé esperándote

Y aunque diga mi oculista
Que tengo muy mala vista
Hoy me quedé. Mirándote

Y pese a que el insomio
Me desvela cada noche
Hoy me quedé. Soñándote

Y yo, que hablo hasta debajo del agua
Hoy me sorprendí escuchándote

Y aunque de puro cobarde
Siempre he sido pacifista
Hoy te luché. Y te gané

Yo, que siempre he sido
De poner tierra por medio
Hoy te vi. Y me quedé

Aunque soy alérgico a la franela
Me quedé en tu cama
No combina mi cortina con tu entretela
Y aun así hoy cocino en tu cocina corazón
Canela en rama
Hoy cocino en tu cocina corazón

Yo, que siempre fui animal nocturno
Hoy me quedo a ver amanecer

Y yo, que siempre fui rockero
Hoy te canto por bolero
Ay si tú. Me dices ven

Yo, que simpre he huido de la moda
Hoy visto Prêt-à-porter

Son las cosas de la vida
Son las cosas del querer

Yo venía de visita
Yo venía de visita
Y me quedé

Aunque soy alérgico a la franela
Me quedé en tu cama
No combina mi cortina con tu entretela
Y aun así hoy cocino en tu cocina corazón
Zón. Zón

Aunque soy alérgico a la franela
Me quedé en tu cama
No combina mi cortina con tu entretela
Y aun así hoy cocino en tu cocina corazón

Il me dit des mots d'amour

Dont je connais la cause
C'est lui pour moi
Moi pour lui, dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie

Alors je sens en moi

Des nuits d'amour à plus finir
Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place
Les ennuis, les chagrins s'effacent
Heureux, heureux à en mourir

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose
Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours

Apostarle todo al color de tus ojos

Los misterios y mapas de tu mirada perdida
Nuestra cama a la deriva
Rescatar  tu llamada perdida
Tu pierna atada a la mía formar contigo geometrias

Cuando cargas las palabras
Tu silencio que ametralla
La bandera de paz bajo las sábanas blancas
Cuando las bocas callan
Cuando los besos hablan
Las mañanas en sincronía las patadas que das dormida

Vivir contigo sin ensayos

Los días sin entusiasmo
Las maratones de amor sin descanso
Seguir la huella que va dejando tu tacto
La payasa la loca la amiga
Tus luces y tus sombras
Que siempre combinan con las mías
Escalar tu cuerpo boca abajo
Anclarme contigo en el espacio
Los sueños que vienen a visitarnos
Descubrir que el mundo a tu lado se hace un poquito menos raro

Lo quiero todo (Todo)
Todo contigo (Todo)
Tus aciertos y tus fallos‚ vivir contigo
Tus luces y tus sombras

Walkin' with our game on
You are my kind, classic mind, and you look so fine

I play pretend it's so true
Follow me down, listen 'round to the deep dark sound
Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm

Ven dime que te falta para que te quedes conmigo
Que por esa boquita, lo que me pidas consigo

Feels like we're on the edge right now

I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it´, my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but

Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down

I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud

I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, let you down

Yeah, I'm sorry
I'm so sorry now
Yeah, I'm sorry that I let you down

Recuerdo aquel día como si fuera hoy
No hay nadie como él, ni siquiera me encontró
Recuerdo todavía la vez que lo besé
Fue mi primer amor, y ahora escribo su canción

Hay algo más inexplicable como su mirada
Inigualable como la manera en que me cela
Trata de disimular que no está mal

Voy a cuidarte por las noches
Voy a amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la tempestad
Aunque existan mil razones para renunciar
No hay nadie más
No hay nadie más

Se llevó todo, se llevó tristeza
Y ya no existe espacio a la melancolía
Porque a su lado todo tiene más razón
Me llevé sus lágrimas, llegaron risas
Cuando estamos juntos la tierra se paraliza, se paraliza

Hay algo más inexplicable como su mirada
Inigualable como la manera en que me cela
Trata de disimular que no está mal

Espero no hacerte enojar

Tengo mil historias de ella en la memoria
Que ninguna te puede gustar
Y no hago esto por pretención
Cuando digo que tengas precaución

Nunca me he dejado llevar
Por algo te ha dejado de hablar
Yo la veo perfecta, no sé de que te quejas
Muy en el fondo la has de extrañar
Yo le doy todo lo que le faltó
El amor que le pide su corazón

Cómo esa mujer me robó la fé
No digas más, te voy a contar
Cómo esa mujer se metió en mi piel

Cuando estamos solos los dos
Yo prendo el fuego en toda la habitación
Y con sus piernas me cobija
Sus manos se deslizan, a su planeta de mi imaginación
Y no hago esto por pretención
Pero sé que la pasamos mejor

Pasamos bien no te mentiré
Pero es tan fácil como amor de motel
Pues tiene un don que te hipnotiza y sus piernas son tan listas
Que envuelve fácil a millones, lo sé
Yo te juro que nada le faltó
No hay amor en dónde no hay corazón

With the lights on in my head
Still loves us the wing, from my little room
Cause I gotta go back soon

Other people's lives, all the long goodbyes
Watching in the mirror with longing in my eyes

Made by that morning, they don't talk to me

To treat me like you do
When you've your hands upon me
And told me who you are

I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now how do I feel

Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more

And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today

And I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard you speak
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now, how should I feel

Tell me how does it feel

How can I do this?
I've never felt this way before
You keep on staring at me
And I can't take it anymore

And I can say the words as I'm tryin break through
But you already know that I really want you

14781,Super Far,LANY,"[Verse 1]
Up all night on my mind got me thinking
Wanna stay, can you give me a reason?
I don't think so, I don't think so
I'm in love with someone, but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't be mean, if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

[Verse 2]
Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work, know it hurts, but I'll go there
Do the same, can you show me that you care?
God, I hope so, but I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't be mean, if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested, I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes

When you're gone or when you're first born
Could you carry me?
Could you carry me?

How we got so far, you and me
Almost like there's oceans between us, us
So I need to know

Right into your distant hands
Could you carry me?

Remember when we would dance all night
Parking lots and velvet skies
I was there for you
And you were there for me

[Verse 4]
Every time we would start a fight
We'd make love till the morning light
I was there for you
And you were there for me

[Pre-Chorus]
So I don't know how we
How we got so far, you and me
Almost like there's oceans between us, us
So I need to know

Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Verse 2]
Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

[Pre-Chorus]
From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen (American teen)

Mmm, oh yeah
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American

So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American (American dream)
And we don't always say what we mean
It's the lie of an American teen

Baby, won't you put it on for me?
I've been working all myself all week

Baby, won't you play the song, drop the bomb
Won't you put it on for me?

Oh-no, when I'm moving in the middle of it
I don't feel no pain
When our song is playing
Oh-no, oh-no

So, baby, won't you put it on for me?
I've been working all myself all week
Baby, won't you play the song, drop the bomb
Won't you put it on for me?

14754,No Sé Decirte No,Marco Mares,"Letra de No sé decirte no

[Verso 1]
Quiéreme otro ratito
Hoy tu mirada me lo grita
Que nuestros cuerpos se derritan
Quiero que se nos pase el día corazón
Juntitos
Dímelo suavecito
Que si en inglés ""I love you mucho""
O en português “te quero muito“
Que los idiomas sobran si somos tú y yo
No hay reglas

[Coro]
Te quiero sin puntos ni mayúsculas
Te veo y no cambio nada en ti, en ti
Te quiero, sin peros ni gramática
Y quiero cien años más de ti
No sé decirte no

[Verso 2]
Háblame a besitos
Que sean muy largos, que no hay prisa
Son como aviones y una visa
Toma tu tiempo y disfrútalo
Vamos, juguemos
A veces no a besos yo prefiero
Si tú me lo pides yo no me muevo
Que cinco minutos se hagan eternos
Quiero y aunque no debo
Renuncio al mundo y a sus relojes
Paguemos las deudas con muchas flores
Quiero, que aunque sea un juego
Te lo imagines junto a mí

[Coro]
Te quiero sin puntos ni mayúsculas
Te veo y no cambio nada en ti, en ti
Te quiero sin puntos ni mayúsculas
Te veo y no cambio nada en ti, en ti
Te quiero, sin peros ni gramática
Y quiero cien años más de ti
No sé decirte no

Mama, come here
Approach, appear
And Daddy, I'm alone

To fight when ya feel like flyin'

But if you love me, don't let go (Hold) Woah
If you love me, don't let go (Hold)

[Verse 1]
Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, what's going on?
But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hideaway with me some more
Mash it

Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh

[Verse 2]
You send me the shiver and the spine, might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge, I'm letting go
Oh-oh, you're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Pulling my head into the clouds, I'm floating off
When you can be going, I can't find a way to stop
Oh-oh, you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

[Chorus]
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure (Ooh, aah)

14793,These Days,Rudimental,"[Intro: Macklemore]
I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

[Verse 1: Dan Caplen]
Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

[Post-Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days

[Verse 2: Dan Caplen & Jess Glynne]
Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk, remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
To these days, these days, oh

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

[Outro: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

14798,Anywhere,Rita Ora,"[Verse 1]
Time flies by when the night is young
Daylight shines on an undisclosed location, location
Bloodshot eyes looking for the sun
Paradise, we lived it and we called it a vacation, vacation

[Pre-Chorus]
You're painting me a dream that I
Wanna belong in, wanna belong in

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
A million miles from L.A.
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away
Someplace where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Just take me anywhere (Anywhere), take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you

[Post-Chorus]
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me
Oh, fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
Truth comes out when we're blacking out
Looking for connection in a crowd of empty faces, empty faces
Your secrets are the only thing I'm craving now
The good and the bad, let me in
'Cause I could take it, I could take it

[Pre-Chorus]
You're painting me a dream that I
Wanna belong in (Wanna belong in), wanna belong in

Boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it

And I am
Only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)

I'll be the beauty queen in tears

Pretty soon, I'll be getting
On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space
But my head's
Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever (Yeah)

You got the light that always shines
I miss the way that you move and the way I get high
When you take me to your heights
Like I'm standin' in the sky

Yeah, BK born and raised, I was Godsent
I used to hit the courts out in Prospect
Takin' long walks how my time spent
Just a kid with that Empire State of mindset
Kickflippin' off a Blind deck
Dippin' from the New York City's finest
Yeah, said l've been up on my New York shit
Walkin' down the block with my New York bitch
I could never leave my city, ain't nothin' like it
Even if I do though, I could never hide it
Top down on the West side when I'm drivin'
East side be the only side that I'm ridin' (Woah)

As a kid, they told me love was made up
But I used to tell em they were wrong
Cause the blue-eyed girl who made me wake up
Will stay right by me in this song
I stood there counting every heartbeat
Thinking about the words to say
Tried not to understand that feeling
But would it ever go away?

[Chorus]
Now those were the days
Before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself
Out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
Will you come dancing next to me?
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me

You told me we would be forever
But maybe we were just too young
I wonder if you still remember
When we were dancing in the sun

Now those were the days
Before you had to go away

Out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know

I got a voice in my head and I'mma let it all out

Wine out on a Wednesday
Glass full 'cause she thirsty
She said, ""don't drink till it's Thursday""
But she'll come out on a workday
When all work and no play could just make Jane go crazy
And it's no fun to worry, goin' home, leaving early
Then she run it up, back it up, when she know you feelin' the work
Turn it up, just a touch, givin' love so good that it hurts
Till she fuck it up, leanin up, even though she still on the up
Leave you shook, turn and looks, make you never want to leave

[Chorus]
'Cause whether Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
You know you could still feel her vibe
Or on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday
You know she could go one more time
And even if they stop the beat or it's time to leave
You know she could go one last time
'Cause whether her place, your place
You know some way you could still feel her vibe

She feelin' caught in the waves
The way she movin' her waist
And you're watchin' that body
The rhythm she rockin', no one could complain
There's a certain kind of grace it takes to dance like nobody's there
No, she don't need no one, because the song's still on

[Chorus]
'Cause whether Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
You know you could still feel her vibe
Or on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday
You know she could go one more time

Promise me you'll never change
But can't explain why you never come around no more
So this is how it's gonna be?
You're texting me on my birthday
You don't even try

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Remember, you told me you'd never forget where you came from
Remember, you told me we'd always stay homies from day one (Oh)

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
And now you're not who you used to be
I don't know what you're dying to prove
So hit me up when you're over being cool
Your new friends will say anything
But if you wanna know the truth
Hit me up when you're over being cool

[Post-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Cool
Cool

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
Used to ask me for my help
When no one else gave a fuck about a single word you said
In a minute I'll be there, no matter where
Kinda funny just how quickly you forget

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Remember, you told me you'd never forget where you came from
Remember, you told me we'd always stay homies from day one (Oh)

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
And now you're not who you used to be (I don't know)
I don't know what you're dying to prove

But if you wanna know the truth
Hit me up when you're over being cool

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Uh, yeah, go
I got her sprung for my dick, she addicted (Yeah)
I got a rude girl, rich off her lipstick (Mwah)
Designer diva, we both materialistic (Guc)
I'm from the 6, but I ball like the fifth pick (Ball)
To make her slide through, I gotta tell her some slick
So many diamonds in it, busting through her wristband
I thought your homegirl was cool, but she flipped it (No)
Don't listen to them hoes, man that's gossip (Oh)
Skinny chick only point me to a thick bitch (Yeah)
Ugly bitch only point me to a pretty chick (Yeah)

Black nights, going blind
Colors fillin' in the lines
Breaking plates to wake my neighbors
Cashing in on all my favors
I'm putting all this emotion behind me tonight

[Chorus]
So get in this car, get lost with us
We can both fall right down to dust
Take it two by two til we rock the bus
We'll be out of this town like an exodus
Up all night til the morning comes
Chasing that coping fairy dust
We've been working so hard and we need the rush
Get out of this town like an exodus
Get out of this town like an exodus
Get out of this town like an exodus

[Verse 2]
Skipping pebbles, throwing stones
Crashing waves and breaking bones
Pray to someone that can save us
Cashing in on all of our favors
I'm putting all this emotion behind me tonight
Said I'm putting all this emotion behind me tonight

[Chorus]
So get in this car, get lost with us
We can both fall right down to dust
Take it two by two 'til we rock the bus
We'll be out of this town like an exodus

Chasing that coping fairy dust
We've been working so hard and we need the rush
Get out of this town like an exodus
Get out of this town like an exodus
Get out of this town like an exodus

Don't hold so tight to yesterday
Don't think too much, just get away
Don't hold so tight to yesterday
To yesterday

Get out of this town like an exodus

14845,Holding Up,Jabberwocky,"[Verse 1]
I know we're daring, but are we strong enough?
Already kings because we simply fear the worst
I know your anger and all the stuff I miss
So it's not the time I guess for giving up now
Inside the cold I'm in, colder than ice
Oh but your haze, I swear, we already fear the worst
You're all I need, that's why I pray for us
There's no better time to stay for holding up now

[Chorus]
Open wide your eyes
Let me blow your mind
It's no time for giving up
No giving up our paradise
Are we strong enough?
I hold on for you and I
I hold on for you and I

Open wide your eyes
Let me blow your mind
It's no time for giving up
No giving up our paradise
Are we strong enough?
I hold on for you and I
I hold on for you and I

[Verse 2]
I know we're daring, but are we strong enough?
Already kings because we simply fear the worst
Will you forget the screams and the silence?
So it's not the time I guess for giving up now
You want the greatest, you run after the most
What are you expecting more, you already fear the worst
It wasn't easy, that's why I stepped first
There's no better time I guess for holding up now

Open wide your eyes
Let me blow your mind
It's no time for giving up
No giving up our paradise
Are we strong enough?
I hold on for you and I

If you give a damn about me?
'Cause you got my hands tied

14835,Never Let You Go,Kygo,"[Verse 1: John Newman]
Emotions like summer
We'll wait for a blue sky
And I turn and hold you
As we watch the sunrise
'Cause this is amazing
Running wild with you
My thoughts are hazy
This may be way too soon

[Chorus: John Newman]
But I will never let you go
Never let you go, oh no
I will never let you go

14812,The Other,Lauv,"[Verse 1]
Like a spotlight the water hits me
Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no one’s listening
I nervously rehearse for when you're around
And I keep waiting like you might change my mind

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Verse 2]
Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
'Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
Oh, I'd rather lay forever right in this bed
And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Post-Chorus]
No one knows (Knows)
No one knows (Knows)

[Bridge]
We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
I'm trying to forget
How I landed on this road
I'm caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

No one knows (Knows)

14817,Surprise Yourself,Jack Garratt,"[Verse 1]
Speak and open up your mind
It's something you should do all the time
Keep exploring, seek and find
You know you might surprise yourself
Talk without a taint to hold
The doubts that should embrace your heart
The calm and chaos of your soul
You know you might surprise yourself

[Verse 2]
Take a pen and write this down
Draw something that can't be found
And learn to walk again somehow
You know you might surprise yourself

[Verse 3]
Lover, if you only knew
The times that train has fooled me too
And tears me from a place I know
It helps me to surprise myself
You know you can surprise yourself
So let go and surprise yourself

14814,Tell Me You Love Me,Galantis,"[Verse 1: Sarah Aarons]
I, I've been up all week
Not getting any sleep, trying to read the signs
I don't know how much more I can take
How much longer I can wait before I lose my mind
You, for heavens sake, you take my breath away
When you're not even trying
You got me wondering what, ooh
What if you were mine?

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
Oh, baby, come on and say it now
Just let the words come out
(Tell me you love me)
It's easy, just say what's on your mind
Say it a million times
(Tell me you love me)

[Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

[Verse 2: Sarah Aarons]
Come on, I know it's way too soon
But I waited for you, I think that's long enough
So long to all those lonely nights, battles and picking fights
It's already been done
I, can't believe my eyes
How on earth did I find myself so far in love?
We could be the perfect match
And what's so wrong with that? Mm

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Aarons]
Oh, baby, come on and say it now
Just let the words come out
(Tell me you love me)
It's easy, just say what's on your mind
Say it a million times

Oh, baby, come on and say it now
Just let the words come out

It's easy, just say what's on your mind
Say it a million times

Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

14837,Grow Up,Olly Murs,"[Verse 1]
I thought about you the other day
What the hell happened with you and me?
Cause, oh, ain't no lovin' no more
You ain't as cool as you used to be
Closer to the mirror than you are to me
I said, oh, had to show you that door

[Pre-Chorus]
Someday I hope we can fix it, 'cause I ain't too proud to try
Say hi to your friends, and if they ever ask you why
We don't talk...

[Chorus]
Know you gotta grow up
Ain't you sick of being immature?
Talkin' loud 'cause you're insecure
You always turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, c'mon
Why you always gotta show off?
You're so vain, I already know
That when you hear this on the radio
You're gonna turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause it's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Now you said some stuff that you can't take back
How did you think that I would react?
Cause you, you must be out of your mind, no
How did we go straight from love to hate?
Now it's so deep that we can't be mates
I said, oh, we should give it some time

[Pre-Chorus]
Someday I hope we can fix it, 'cause I ain't too proud to try
Say hi to your friends, and if they ever ask you why
We don't talk...

[Chorus]
Know you gotta grow up
Ain't you sick of being immature?
Talkin' loud 'cause you're insecure
You always turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, c'mon
Why you always gotta show off?
You're so vain, I already know
That when you hear this on the radio
You're gonna turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause it's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anytime you start it
You're growing up a little, darlin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anytime you start it
You're growing up a little, darlin'

[Chorus]
Know you gotta grow up
(Know you gotta grow up)
Ain't you sick of being immature?
(Ain't you sick of being immature?)
Talkin' loud 'cause you're insecure
(Talkin' loud 'cause you're insecure)
You always turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, c'mon
Why you always gotta show off?
(Why you always gotta show off?)
You're so offended, I already know
(You're so offended, I already know)
But when you hear this on the radio
You're gonna turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

[Outro]
'Cause it's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Anytime you start it
You're growing up a little darlin'
'Cause it's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Anytime you start it
You're growing up a little darlin'

14821,Lullabies,Yuna,"[Intro]
Like lullabies you are
Forever in my mind
I see you in all
The pieces in my life
Though you weren't mine
You were my first love

[Verse 1]
I wanted to go away with you
And I will leave all my troubles here
I wanted to run away with you
And I will bring all my dreams and fears

[Chorus]
Like lullabies you are
Forever in my mind
I see you in all
The pieces in my life
Though you weren't mine...
Like lullabies you are
Forever in my mind
I see you in all
The pieces in my life
Though you weren't mine

[Bridge]
Though you weren't mine
You were my first love
You were my first love

[Verse 2]
I wanted to start again with you
And I will leave all my worries here
I wanted only you
I know that I felt with you

[Chorus]
Like lullabies you are
Forever in my mind
I see you in all
The pieces in my life
Though you weren't mine...
Like lullabies you are
Forever in my mind
I see you in all
The pieces in my life
Though you weren't mine...

Though you weren't mine

14822,I Like Me Better,Lauv,"[Verse 1]
To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee, burnin' through the hours talking
Damn

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I don't know what it is but I got that feelin'
Wakin' up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you somethin'
Damn

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Bridge]
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Lay here with me, eh-eh, eh-eh, ooh

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you (Yes, I do, yes, I do, babe)
I like me better when I'm with you (Oooh no)
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

14894,Laura no està,Nek,"[Letra de ""Laura no está""]

[Verso 1]
Laura no está, Laura se fue
Laura se escapa de mi vida
Y tú que sí estás, preguntas por qué
La amo a pesar de las heridas
Lo ocupa todo su recuerdo
No consigo olvidar
El beso de su cuerpo

[Verso 2]
Laura no está, eso lo sé
Y no la encontraré en tu piel
Es enfermizo, sabes que no quisiera
Besarte a ti pensando en ella
Esta noche inventaré una tregua
Ya no quiero pensar más
Contigo olvidaré su ausencia

[Coro]
Y si te como a besos, tal vez
La noche sea más corta, no lo sé
Yo solo no me basto, quédate
Y lléname su espacio, quédate
¡Quédateee! Uo-oh, uuh

[Verso 3]
Laura se fue, no dijo adiós
Dejando rota mi pasión
Laura quizá ya me olvidó
Y otro rozó su corazón
Y yo sólo sé decir su nombre
No recuerdo ni siquiera el mío
¿Quién me abrigará este frío?

[Coro]
Y si te como a besos, tal vez
La noche sea más corta, no lo sé
Yo solo no me basto, quédate
Y lléname su espacio, quédate
¡Quédateee! Uh, uah

[Puente]
Puede ser difícil para ti
Pero no puedo olvidarla
Creo que es lógico
Por más que yo intente escaparme
Ella está, oh
Unas horas jugaré a quererte
Pero cuando vuelva a amanecer
Me perderás para siempre

[Verso 4]
Y si te como a besos sabrás
Lo mucho que me duele este dolor
No encontraré en tu abrazo el sabor
De los sueños que Laura me robó, oh
Si me enredo en tu cuerpo sabrás
Que sólo Laura es dueña de mi amor
No encontraré en tu abrazo el sabor
De los besos que Laura me robó, me robó

14874,Dónde está el amor,Pablo Alborán,"[Joy Huerta]
No hace falta que me quites la mirada
Para que entienda que ya no queda nada
Aquella luna que antes nos bailaba
Se ha cansado y ahora nos da la espalda

¿Dónde está el amor del que tanto hablan?
¿Por qué no nos sorprende y rompe nuestra calma?

Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo
Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho
Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo
Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero
Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca
Déjame que voy a detener las horas
Volveré a pintar de azul el universo
Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño

[Verso 2: Pablo Alborán]
Tengo contados todos los besos que nos damos
Y tú fugitiva, andas perdida en otro lado
Yo no quiero caricias de otros labios
No quiero tus manos en otras manos
Porque yo quiero que volvamos a intentarlo

[Pre-Estribillo: Ambos & Pablo Alborán]
¿Dónde está el amor del que tanto hablan?
¿Por qué no nos sorprende y rompe nuestra calma?

Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero
Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca
Déjame que voy a detener las horas
Volveré a pintar de azul el universo
Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño

(Donde esta el amor)
Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo
Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho
Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo
Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero
Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca
Déjame que voy a detener las horas
Volveré a pintar de azul el universo
Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño

[Verso 1]
Precisamente ahora que tú ya te has ido
Me han dicho que has estado engañándome
¿Por qué de pronto tienes tantos enemigos?
¿Por qué tengo que andar disculpándote?
Si ellos están mintiendo, por favor defiéndete
Yo sé que no lo harás, pues dicen la verdad
Es una pena siempre seguirás doliéndome
Y culpable o no
¿Qué le puedo hacer ya?

[Coro]
Miénteme como siempre, por favor miénteme
Necesito creerte, convénceme
Miénteme con un beso que parezca de amor
Necesito quererte, culpable o no

[Verso 2]
No tengo ya derecho a reprocharte nada
Pues nada queda ya de ti, de mí, de ayer
Qué pena, nuestra historia pudo ser fantástica
Y ahora dime, mi amor
¿Quién te va a defender?

[Coro]
Miénteme como siempre, por favor miénteme
Necesito creerte, convénceme
Miénteme con un beso que parezca de amor

14859,El Sol No Regresa,La Quinta Estacion,"Hace dias perdí en alguna cantina
La mitad de mi alma, más el 15 de propina
No es que sea el alcohol, la mejor medicina
Pero ayuda a olvidar, cuando no ves la salida
Hoy te intento contar
Que todo va bien aunque no te lo creas
Aunque a estas alturas
Un último esfuerzo no valga la pena
Hoy los buenos recuerdos
Se caen por las escaleras
Y tras varios tequilas
Las nubes se van
Pero el sol no regresa
Sueños de habitación de un hotel de carretera
Y unas gotas de lluvia que guardo en esta maleta
Ruedan por el colchón de mi cama ya desierta
Es la mejor solución para el dolor de cabeza
Hoy te intento contar
Que todo va bien aunque no te lo creas
Aunque a estas alturas
Un último esfuerzo no valga la pena
Hoy los buenos recuerdos
Se caen por las escaleras
Y tras varios tequilas
Las nubes se van
Pero el sol no regresa
Hoy te intento contar
Que todo va bien aunque no te lo creas
Aunque a estas alturas
Un último esfuerzo no valga la pena
Hoy los buenos recuerdos
Se caen por las escaleras
Y tras varios tequilas
Las nubes se van
Pero el sol no regresa
Y tras varios tequilas
Las nubes se van
Pero el sol no regresa

14857,Be Like You,CVBZ,"[Verse 1]
If I could walk on water, I'd still drown in you
And if I were 10 feet taller
You know I'd get tired of the view from the back of the room
I wanna change my name, cut ties with this whole city
Cause it's lonely living and I'm always leaving and I
Now I'mma lay it down, lay it down, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm tired of the place I love
And I'm tired of trying to fit in
Cause I'm losing my own youth
And I ain't given you up, I'm never giving it up
The skies don't listen
They don't know the sacrifice I'm giving
Cause I don't wanna be the ghost of me
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you

[Verse 2]
If I could walk on water, I'd still drown in you
And if I could talk to my father, I know he'd be proud
Facts that they grew from the ground up
I found love in the city of fallen angels
Just look at how far we came, though
This is what we always aimed for

[Chorus]
I'm tired of the place I love
And I'm tired of trying to fit in
Cause I'm losing my own youth
And I ain't given you up, I'm never giving it up
The skies don't listen
They don't the sacrifice I'm giving
Cause I don't wanna be the ghost of me
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you

[Chorus]
I'm tired of the place I love
And I'm tired of trying to fit in
Cause I'm losing my own youth
And I ain't given you up, I'm never giving it up
The skies don't listen
They don't know the sacrifice I'm giving
Cause I don't wanna be the ghost of me
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you

I believe in pressing diamonds from the sand
I can feel the touch of Midas in my hands
And I carry it wherever I go
I'm depending on the angels by my side
I've been having conversations with the sky
And I call on them when I get low

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you were me, you'd be living the way I do
I don't get high 'cause I'm already on my roof

[Chorus]
So don't wake a dreamer
Got my head in the clouds
Where the Gods can hear me out
Don't wake a dreamer
Reaching for gold
That's all I know

[Verse 2]
I've been dancing with the sinners and the saints
Underneath it are we naked and the same
And we dance again whenever we want
I've been rising like a Phoenix from the past
See my colors burning brighter in the ash
And they catch a flame when I'm in the dark

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you were me, you'll be sky walking in my shoes
Tip toe the tight rope between the sun and the moon

[Chorus]
So don't wake a dreamer
Got my head in the clouds
Where the Gods can hear me out
Don't wake a dreamer
Reaching for gold
That's all I know

I don't see reality
I escape to a place I call home
I don't bleed red like you
I escape to a higher place
That's why you

So don't wake a dreamer
Got my head in the clouds
Where the Gods can hear me out
So don't wake a dreamer
Reaching for gold
That's all I know
Don't wake a dreamer
Reaching for gold
That's all I know
So don't wake a dreamer

Mírame, en nada me consigo concentrar
Ando despistado, todo lo hago mal
Soy un desastre y no sé qué está pasando
Me gustas a rabiar, te deseo
Me llegas a desesperar
Es tan grande lo que siento por ti
Que tenerte no bastará
Qué es esto que me invita a vivir?
Qué me da la ilusión?
Qué será esa fuerza que a todos
Nos une de dos en dos?
Será la fuerza del corazón?

[Verse 2]
Hace que te abrace
Y los cuerpos lleguen a estorbar
Tiemblo sólo con la idea de rozar
Tus labios llenos de besos nuevos
No puedo dormir, robas mi tranquilidad
Alguien ha bordado tu cuerpo
Con hilos de mi ansiedad
De cinturón tus piernas cruzadas
De mi espalda un reloj
Donde tus dedos son las agujas
Que dan cuerda a este motor
Que es la fuerza del corazón, no no

[Chorus]
Y es la fuerza que te lleva
Que te empuja y que te llena
Que te arrastra y que te acerca a Dios
Es un sentimiento, casi una obsesión
Si la fuerza es del corazón
Es algo que te lía
La descarga de energía
Que te va quitando la razón
Te hace tropezar, te crea confusión
Seguro que es la fuerza del corazón
Es la fuerza que te lleva, no no, no

[Verse 3]
No puedo pensar, tendría que cuidarme más
Poco a poco pierdo la vida
Y luego me la das
Qué es lo que va cegando al amante
Que va por ahí de señor?
Y no es más que un chiquillo travieso, provocador
Será la fuerza del corazón? No no no

Que te empuja y que te llena
Que te arrastra y que te acerca a Dios
Es un sentimiento, casi una obsesión

Te hace tropezar, te crea confusión
Seguro que es la fuerza del corazón

Y yo que no sabía el daño que me hacía

Cómo es que nunca me fijé que ya no sonreías
Y que antes de apagar la luz ya nada me decías
Que a ti el amor se te escapó, que había llegado el día
Que ya no me sentías, que ya ni te dolía

Me dediqué a perderte
Y me ausenté en momentos que se han ido para siempre
Me dediqué a no verte
Y me encerré en mi mundo y no pudiste detenerme
Y me alejé mil veces, y cuando regresé te había perdido para siempre
Y quise detenerte
Y entonces descubrí que ya mirabas diferente
Me dediqué a perderte, me dediqué a perderte

¿Por qué no te llené de mí cuando aún había tiempo?
¿Por qué no pude comprender lo que a esta hora entiendo?
Que fuiste todo para mí y que yo estaba ciego

Y me ausenté en momentos que se han ido para siempre
Me dediqué a no verte
Y me encerré en mi mundo y no pudiste detenerme
Y me alejé mil veces, y cuando regresé te había perdido para siempre
Y quise detenerte
Y entonces descubrí que ya mirabas diferente
Me dediqué a perderte, me dediqué a perderte
"
14881,Mujeres,Ricardo Arjona,"[Letra de ""Mujeres""]

[Verso 1]
No sé quién las inventó
No sé quién nos hizo ese favor, tuvo que ser Dios
Que vio al hombre tan solo y sin dudar lo pensó en dos
En dos
Dicen que fue una costilla
Hubiese dado mi columna vertebral por verlas andar
Después de hacer el amor hasta el tocador y sin voltear
Sin voltear, sin voltear

[Pre-Coro]
Y si habitaran la luna
Habría más astronautas que arenas en el mar
Más viajes al espacio que historias en un bar
En un bar ¿Por qué negar
Que es lo mejor que se puso en este lugar?

[Coro]
Mujeres, lo que nos pidan podemos
Si no podemos no existe
Y si no existe lo inventamos por ustedes
Mujeres, lo que nos pidan podemos
Si no podemos no existe
Y si no existe lo inventamos por ustedes
Mujeres
¿Qué hubiera escrito Neruda?
¿Qué habría pintado Picasso
Si no existieran musas como ustedes

[Verso 3]
Nosotros con el machismo, ustedes al feminismo
Y al final la historia termina en par
Porque en pareja vinimos y en pareja hay que terminar
Terminar, terminar

[Pre-Coro]
Y si habitaran la Luna
Habría más astronautas que arenas en el mar
Más viajes al espacio que historias en un bar
En un bar ¿Por qué negar

14876,Dígale,David Bisbal,"[Letra de ""Dígale""]

[Verso 1]
No ha podido olvidar mi corazón
Aquellos ojos tristes soñadores que yo amé
La dejé por conquistar una ilusión
Y perdí su rastro
Y ahora sé que es ella
Todo lo que yo buscaba

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy aquí
Buscándola de nuevo
Ya no está, se fue
Tal vez usted la ha visto dígale
Que yo siempre la adoré
Y que nunca la olvidé
Que mi vida es un desierto
Y muero yo de sed
Y dígale también
Que sólo junto a ella puedo respirar
No hay brillo en las estrellas
Ya ni el sol me calienta
Y estoy muy solo aquí
No sé a donde fue
Por favor dígale usted

[Verso 2]
Fueron tantos los momentos que la amé
Que siento sus caricias y su olor está en mi piel
Cada noche la abrazaba junto a mi
La cubría de besos
Y entre mil caricias
La llevaba a la locura

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy aquí
Buscándola de nuevo
Ya no está, se fue
Tal vez usted la ha visto dígale
Que yo siempre la adoré
Y que nunca la olvidé
Que mi vida es un desierto
Y muero yo de sed
Y dígale también
Que sólo junto a ella puedo respirar
No hay brillo en las estrellas
Ya ni el sol me calienta
Y estoy muy solo aquí
No sé a donde fue
Por favor dígale usted

[Verso 1]
¿Quién dice que no duelen
Las huellas en la arena?
Tu huella el mar se la llevó
Pero la Luna sigue ahí
Pero esa Luna es mi condena
Despacio en la mañana
A gritos por la noche
Las voces vivas del recuerdo se disfrazan de intuición
Y en una voz, tu voz se esconde
Y en una voz, tu voz se esconde

[Pre-coro]
Y yo sé que tal vez
Tú nunca escuches mi canción, yo sé
Y yo sé que tal vez te siga usando así
Robándote mi inspiración

[Coro]
Mientras siga viendo tu cara en la cara de la Luna
Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación
Porque cada canción me hable de ti, de ti, de ti
Me hable de ti

[Verso 2]
La vida se me esconde
Detrás de una promesa sin cumplir
¿De dónde nace alguna inspiración?
¿De dónde nace otra canción?
Y ya no sé bien quién se esconde
Yo ya no sé lo que se esconde

[Pre-coro]
Y yo sé que tal vez
Tú nunca escuches mi canción, yo sé
Y yo sé que tal vez te siga usando así
Robándote mi inspiración

[Coro]
Mientras siga viendo tu cara en la cara de la Luna
Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación
Porque cada canción me hable de ti, de ti, de ti
Ay, mientras siga viendo tu cara en la cara de la Luna
Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación
Porque cada canción me hable de ti, de ti, de ti

[Puente]
Yo seguiré buscando o seguiré escapando
Tal vez de ti, tal vez de mí
Yo seguiré buscándole una explicación, a esta canción

[Coro]
Ay, mientras siga viendo tu cara en la cara de la Luna
Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación
Porque cada canción me hable de ti, de ti, de ti

Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación

14870,Azul,Cristian Castro,"[Verso 1]
Fue una mañana que yo te encontré
Cuando la brisa besaba tu dulce piel
Tus ojos tristes que al ver adore
La noche que yo te ame, eh

Azul, cuando el silencio por fin te bese
Azul, sentí muy dentro nacer este amor
Azul, hoy miro al cielo y en ti puedo ver
La estrella que siempre soñé

[Choro]
Azul, y es que este amor es azul como el mar
Azul, como de tu mirada nació mi ilusión
Azul como una lagrima cuando hay perdón
Tan puro y tan azul que me han vuelto el corazón

Es que este amor es azul como el mar
Azul, como el azul del cielo nació entre los dos
Azul, como el lucero de nuestra pasión
Un manantial azul que me llena de amor

[Verso 2]
Como el milagro que tanto espere
Eres la niña que siempre busque
Azul, es tu inocencia que quiero entender
Tu príncipe azul yo seré

Azul, es mi locura si estoy junto a ti
Azul, rayo de luna serás para mi
Azul, con la lluvia pintada de azul
Por siempre serás solo tu

[Choro x4]
Azul, y es que este amor es azul como el mar
Azul, como de tu mirada nació mi ilusión
Azul como una lagrima cuando hay perdón
Tan puro y tan azul que me han vuelto el corazón

Desde que llegaste vida
Me susurran los silencios
Y las flores renacen
Apenas sube el sol
Se ríen del invierno
Desde que llegaste vida
Le hemos hecho trampa al tiempo
Mi cura es tu abrazo
Tu suspiro una canción
Que me arrulla como el viento

Yo soy el hombre más afortunado
Me ha tocado ser
Él que conoce cada línea de tu mano
Él que te cuida y camina a tu lado

Todo ese amor por ti
Mi corazón te abrí
Desde entonces llevó el cielo dentro de mí
Nunca jamás sentí
Una alegría así
Que bendición hallar cada instante
En que se fue la luz
Llegaste tú

14879,Abrázame Muy Fuerte,Juan Gabriel,"Cuando tú estás conmigo es cuando yo digo
Que valió la pena todo, todo lo que yo he sufrido
No sé si es un sueño aún o es una realidad

Pero cuando estoy contigo es cuando digo:
Que este amor que siento es porque tú lo has merecido
Con decirte amor que otra vez he amanecido
Llorando de felicidad;
A tu lado yo siento que estoy viviendo
Nada es como ayer

Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y él nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo
Abrázame que el tiempo es oro si tú estas conmigo

Abrázame fuerte, muy fuerte, y más fuerte que nunca
Siempre abrázame

Hoy que tú estás conmigo
Yo no sé si está pasando el tiempo o tú lo has detenido
Así quiero estar por siempre
Aprovecho que estás tú conmigo
Te doy gracias por cada momento de mi vivir

Tú cuando mires para el cielo
Por cada estrella que aparezca amor es un ""te quiero""

Abrázame que el tiempo hiere y el cielo es testigo
Que el tiempo es cruel y a nadie quiere por eso te digo:

Abrázame muy fuerte amor, mantenme así a tu lado
Yo quiero agradecerte amor todo lo que me has dado
Quiero corresponderte de una forma u otra a diario;
Amor yo nunca del dolor he sido partidario
Pero a mí me toco sufrir cuando confié y creí
En alguien que juró que daba su vida por mi

Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y ese no se detiene
Abrázame muy fuerte amor que el tiempo en contra viene
Abrázame que Dios perdona, pero el tiempo a ninguno
Abrázame que no le importa saber quien es uno
Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y él nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo
Abrázame muy fuerte amor

Te doy hasta mis suspiros

La potencia de mi voz
Los pies con que camino
Eres tú, amor
Mis ganas de reír
El adiós que no sabré decir
Porque nunca podré vivir sin ti

Si algún día decidieras
Alejarte nuevamente de aquí
Cerraría cada puerta
Para que nunca pudieras salir
Te regalo mis silencios
Te regalo mi nariz
Yo te doy hasta mis huesos
Pero quédate aquí

Tiritas pa' este corazón partí'o (Tiri-Tiri-Tirititando de frío)
Tiritas pa' este corazón partí'o (Pa' este corazón)

[Verso 1]
Ya lo ves, que no hay dos sin tres
Que la vida va y viene y que no se detiene, y qué sé yo
Pero miénteme aunque sea
Dime que algo queda entre nosotros dos
Que en tu habitación nunca sale el sol
Ni existe el tiempo ni el dolor
Llévame si quieres a perder
A ningún destino, sin ningún porqué

[Verso 2]
Ya lo sé, que corazón que no ve
Es corazón que no siente o corazón que te miente, amor
Pero sabes que en lo más profundo de mi alma sigue aquel dolor
Por creer en ti, ¿qué fue de la ilusión
Y de lo bello que es vivir?

[Pre-Coro]
¿Para qué me curaste cuando estaba herí'o?
Si hoy me dejas de nuevo el corazón partí'o

¿Y quién me va a entregar sus emociones?
¿Quién me va a pedir que nunca la abandone?
¿Quién me tapará esta noche si hace frío?
¿Quién me va a curar el corazón partí'o?

Y bajará la luna para que juguemos?
Dime, si tú te vas, dime, cariño mío

Después de la tormenta siempre llega la calma

Después de ti no hay nada

They're hanging forever, there
Waiting forever, for you

Cause I ain't holding up, for nobody else

Heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you

Esa sonrisa traviesa que vive conmigo
Sé que pronto estaré en tu camino

Sabes que estoy colgando en tus manos
Hmm, así que no me dejes caer
Sabes que estoy colgando en tus manos

Te envío poemas de mi puño y letra
Te envío canciones de cuatro cuarenta
Te envío las fotos cenando en Marbella
Y cuando estuvimos por Venezuela
Y así me recuerdes y tengas presente
Que mi corazón está colgando en tus manos
Cuidado, cuidado que mi corazón esta colgando en tus manos

[Verso 2: Carlos Baute, Marta Sanchez]
No perderé la esperanza de hablar contigo
Hmm, no me importa qué dice el destino
Quiero tener tu fragancia conmigo
Y beberme de ti lo prohibido

Hmm, así que no me dejes caer

14888,Mientes Tan Bien,Sin Bandera,"[Letra de ""Mientes Tan Bien""]

[Verso 1]
Que te quedarás conmigo una vida entera
Que contigo: adiós inviernos, solo primavera
Que las olas son de magia y no de agua salada
Yo te creo todo y tú no me das nada, tú no me das nada

[Verso 2]
Que si sigo tu camino llegaré hasta el cielo
Tú me mientes en la cara y yo me vuelvo ciego
Yo me trago tus palabras, tú juegas un juego
Y me brilla el mundo cuando dices: ""Luego""
Cuando dices ""Luego""

[Pre-Coro]
Cuando dices: ""Siento, siento que eres todo""
Cuando dices: ""Vida, yo estaré contigo""
Tomas de mi mano y por dentro lloro
Aunque sea mentira, me haces sentir vivo
Aunque es falso el aire, siento que respiro

[Coro]
Mientes tan bien
Que me sabe a verdad todo lo que me das
Y ya te estoy amando
Mientes tan bien
Que he llegado a imaginar que en mi amor llenas tu piel
Y aunque todo es de papel, mhm, mientes tan bien

[Pre-Coro]
Cuando dices: ""Siento, siento que eres todo""

14868,Creo en Ti,Reik,"[Letra de ""Creo en Ti""]

[Verso 1: Jesús Navarro]
Ya no importa cada noche que esperé
Cada calle o laberinto que crucé
Porque el cielo ha conspirado a mi favor
Y a un segundo de rendirme te encontré

[Pre-Coro 1: Jesús Navarro]
Piel con piel, el corazón se me desarma
Me haces bien, enciendes luces en mi alma

[Coro: Jesús Navarro]
Creo en ti y en este amor
Que me ha vuelto indestructible, que detuvo mi caída libre
Creo en ti y mi dolor se quedó kilómetros atrás
Mis fantasmas hoy por fin están en paz

[Verso 2: Jesús Navarro]
El pasado es un mal sueño que acabó
Un incendio que en tus brazos se apagó
Cuando estaba a medio paso de caer
Mis silencios se encontraron con tu voz

[Pre-Coro 2: Jesús Navarro]
Te seguí y reescribiste mi futuro
Es aquí mi único lugar seguro

[Coro: Jesús Navarro]
Creo en ti y en este amor
Que me ha vuelto indestructible, que detuvo mi caída libre
Creo en ti y mi dolor se quedó kilómetros atrás
Mis fantasmas hoy por fin están en paz

14855,Breakup Song,De Hofnar,"[Verse]
What if we could start again?
Would I still be your only man?
Would we try to hide the love that's inside
Keep running till our hearts won't collide
Be sure that we don't
Fall in love again

[Chorus]
And you know that it's too late, now
To find somebody better than me
It's for a reason, and somehow
There's some place I would rather be
And I don't need your pity, babe
And moved to another city, babe
Cause I know one thing, for sure
I don't love you anymore

I don't love you anymore

[Verse]
The final straw, final drive
Kept it all together, trying to survive
We're traveling for ages, but we won't arrive
We're running out of gas, now we need to refill
We need to decide, I'm driving alone
Now keep on walking babe, I'll find you at home
And don't come back, it's the amazon
Let me give it to you straight

[Chorus]
And you know that it's too late, now
To find somebody better than me
It's for a reason and somehow
There's some place I would rather be
And I don't need your pity, babe
And moved to another city, babe
Cause I know one thing, for sure
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore

14890,No Me Doy Por Vencido,Luis Fonsi,"[Letra de ""No Me Doy por Vencido""]

[Intro]
Me quedo callado, soy como un niño dormido
Que puede despertarse con apenas sólo un ruido
Cuando menos te lo esperas, cuando menos lo imagino
Sé que un día no me aguanto y voy y te miro

[Verso 1]
Y te lo digo a los gritos
Y te ríes y me tomas por un loco atrevido
Pues no sabes cuánto tiempo en mis sueños has vivido
Ni sospechas cuando te nombré

[Coro]
Yo, yo no me doy por vencido, yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar; y esperar; y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo, no me doy por vencido

[Verso 2]
Tengo una flor de bolsillo
Marchita de buscar a una mujer que me quiera
Y reciba su perfume hasta traer la primavera
Y me enseñe lo que no aprendí de la vida
Que brilla más cada día
Porque estoy tan sólo a un paso de ganarme la alegría
Porque el corazón levanta una tormenta enfurecida
Desde aquel momento en que te vi

[Coro]
Yo, yo no me doy por vencido
Yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo, no me doy por vencido

[Puente]
Este silencio esconde demasiadas palabras
No me detengo, pase lo que pase seguiré

[Coro]
Yo, yo no me doy por vencido
Yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo, no me doy por vencido

[Outro]
Oh, juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo
No me doy por vencido

14878,Vuelve,Ricky Martin,"[Letra de ""Vuelve""]

[Verso 1]
Algo me dice que ya no volverás
Estoy seguro que esta vez no habrá marcha atrás
Después de todo fui yo a decirte que no
Sabes bien que no es cierto
Estoy muriendo por dentro

Y ahora es que me doy cuenta que sin ti no soy nada
He perdido las fuerzas, he perdido las ganas
He intentado encontrarte en otras personas
No es igual, no es lo mismo
Nos separa un abismo

[Coro 1]
Vuelve que sin ti la vida se me va
Oh, vuelve que me falta el aire si tu no estas
Oh, vuelve, nadie ocupara tu lugar

[Coro 2]
Sobra tanto espacio si no estas
No paso un minuto sin pensar
Sin ti la vida lentamente se me va

[Verso 2]
Algo me dice ya no sirve de nada
Tantas noches en vela aferrado a mi almohada
Si pudiera tan solo regresar un momento
Ahora es que te comprendo
Ahora es cuando te pierdo

[Coro 1]
Vuelve que sin ti la vida se me va
Oh, vuelve que me falta el aire si tu no estas
Oh, vuelve, nadie ocupara tu lugar

[Coro 2]
Sobra tanto espacio si no estas
No paso un minuto sin pensar
Sin ti la vida lentamente se me va

[Puente]
Y a pesar que fui yo a decirte que no
Sin embargo aqui sigo insistiendote

[Coro 1]
Vuelve que sin ti la vida se me va
Oh, vuelve que me falta el aire si tu no estas
Oh, vuelve,nadie ocupara tu lugar

Vuelve que sin ti la vida se me va
Oh, vuelve que me falta el aire si tu no estas
Oh, vuelve, nadie ocupara tu lugar

14886,Inevitable,Shakira,"[Letra de ""Inevitable""]

[Verso 1]
Si es cuestión de confesar
No sé preparar café
Y no entiendo de fútbol
Creo que alguna vez fui infiel
Juego mal hasta el parqués y jamás uso reloj
Y, para ser más franca, nadie piensa en ti como lo hago yo
Aunque te dé lo mismo

[Verso 2]
Si es cuestión de confesar
Nunca duermo antes de diez
Ni me baño los domingos
La verdad es que también lloro una vez al mes
Sobre todo cuando hay frio

[Pre-Coro]
Conmigo nada es fácil, ya debes saber
Me conoces bien
Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido

[Coro]
El cielo está cansado ya de ver la lluvia caer
Y cada día que pasa es uno más parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte porque
Seguir amándote es inevitable

[Verso 3]
Siempre supe que es mejor
Cuando hay que hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo
Ya sabrás la situación
Aquí todo está peor
Pero al menos aún respiro

[Pre-Coro]
No tienes que decirlo, no vas a volver
Te conozco bien
Ya buscaré qué hacer conmigo

[Coro]
El cielo está cansado ya de ver la lluvia caer
Y cada día que pasa es uno más parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte porque
Seguir amándote es inevitable

Que me importan lo que viví
Si me regalan el futuro no lo quiero sin ti

[Chorus]
Ay no me digas no
Si escondes algo dámelo
Porque llegó la hora de estar conmigo
Pues el destino así lo escribió
Si es amor, Abrázame con ganas
Si no lo es, tal vez será mañana
Estando juntos mi mundo se llena de luz
Lo mejor de mi vida eres tú

Me voy de fiesta si quieres ir (quiero ir!)
De buenos aires hasta Madrid (hay ole!)
Y sin dormirnos acabar con parís
Te juro que jamás te vas a arrepentir

Si es amor, Abrázame con ganas
Si no lo es, tal vez será mañana
Estando juntos mi mundo se llena de luz

Suéltate el pelo y juega entre las olas (entre las olas)
Sobre la arena a la orilla del mar (la orilla del mar)
Prepárate que la noche no perdona
Ven que nos vamos de marcha otra vez

Lo mejor lo mejor lo mejor
Lo mejor de mi vida eres tu [x2]

Si tu recuerdo me hace bien

Ahí está, cuidándome en mi soledad

O me hace mal

14867,Fuiste Tú,Ricardo Arjona,"[Letra de ""Fuiste Tú""]

[Intro Instrumental]

[Verso 1: Gaby Moreno]
Fuiste tú
Tenerte fue una foto tuya puesta en mi cartera
Un beso y verte hacer pequeño por la carretera
Lo tuyo fue la intermitencia y la melancolía
Lo mío fue aceptarlo todo porque te quería
Verte llegar fue luz, verte partir un blues

[Verso 2: Ricardo Arjona]
Fuiste tú
De más está decir que sobra decir tantas cosas
O aprendes a querer la espina o no aceptes rosas
Jamás te dije una mentira o te inventé un chantaje
Las nubes grises también forman parte del paisaje

[Pre-Coro: Ricardo Arjona]
Y no me veas así
Si hubo un culpable aquí
Fuiste tú

[Coro: Ricardo Arjona & Gaby Moreno]
Qué fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez
Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque
Que encendió la luz que hoy se desaparece
Así se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia
Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas
Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte

[Post-Coro: Ricardo Arjona & Gaby Moreno, Ricardo Arjona]
Nada más que decir
Solo queda insistir
Dilo

[Verso 3: Gaby Moreno, Ricardo Arjona]
Fuiste tú
La luz de neón del barrio sabe que estoy tan cansada
Me ha visto caminar descalza por la madrugada
Estoy en medio del que soy y del que tú quisieras (Uh)
Queriendo despertar pensando como no quisiera (Uh)

[Pre-Coro: Ricardo Arjona, Gaby Moreno & Ambos]
Y no me veas así (Uh)
Si hubo un culpable aquí
Fuiste tú

Qué fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez

Que encendió la luz que hoy se desaparece
Así se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia
Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas
Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte

[Post-Coro: Ricardo Arjona, Gaby Moreno & Ambos]
Nada más que decir (Nada más que decir)
Solo queda insistir (Oh), fuiste tú

You bought yourself a little freedom
Yeah I know you saved up, yeah you saved up
So make it last
You got some brand new sneakers
Little darling lace up, darling lace up
And make it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They'll try to make you talk
Don't give them nothing
You're up against the wall
Waiting for judgement
Open your prison door
Nobody's watching

You only get one shot
You better run for your life
You better run for your life

[Verse 2]
Is it everything you dream of?
Now that you've got your eyes up, got your eyes up
Off the ground
You hear me calling out your treason
Little rebel rise up, go and rise up
And make us proud

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They'll feed you sense and doubt
Play on your conscience
But you'd rather risk it all
Fighting for justice
Here's what you waited for
Everyone's watching

You only get one shot
You better run for your life
You better run for your life

[Pre-Chorus]
They'll try to make you talk
Don't give them nothing
You're up against the wall
Waiting for judgement
Open your prison
Nobody's watching

14882,Amores extraños,Laura Pausini,"Letra de ""Amores extraños""
Ya sabí­a que no llegarí­a
Ya sabí­a que era una mentira
Cuanto tiempo que por él perdí­
Que promesa rota sin cumplir
Son amores problemáticos
Como tú, como yo
Es la espera en un teléfono
La aventura de lo ilógico
La locura de lo mágico
Un veneno sin antí­doto
La amargura de lo efí­mero
Porque él se marchó
Amores, tan extraños que te hacen cí­nica
Te hacen sonreí­r entre lágrimas
Cuántas páginas hipotéticas, para no escribir las
Auténticas
Son amores que sólo a nuestra edad
Se confunden en nuestros espí­ritus
Te interrogan y nunca te dejan ver
Si serán amor o placer
Y cuantas noches lloraré por él
Cuantas veces volveré a leer
Aquellas cartas que yo recibí­a
Cuando mis penas eran alegrí­as
Son amores esporádicos
Pero en ti quedarán
Amores, tan extraños que vienen y se van
Que en tu corazón sobrevivirán
Son historias que siempre contarás
Sin saber si son de verdad
Son amores frágiles
Prisioneros, cómplices
Son amores problemáticos
Como tú, como yo
Son amores frágiles
Prisioneros, cómplices
Tan extraños que viven negándose
Escondiéndose de los dos
Son amores que sólo a nuestra edad
Se confunden en nuestro espí­ritu
Son amores problemáticos
Que se esconderán de los dos
Son amores que vienen y se van
Son historias que siempre contarás
Ya sabí­a que no llegarí­a
Esta vez me lo prometeré
Tengo ganas de un amor sincero, ya sin él

[Verso 1]
¿Cómo estás? ¿qué tal te va?
¿Allí es de día o es de noche?
¿Es bonita esa ciudad para ir de vacaciones?
Y el hotel, ¿era verdad que es tan romántico y lujoso
Como en la publicidad, con esas playas de las fotos?

[Verso 2]
En Madrid está lloviendo y todo sigue como siempre
Solamente que no estás, y el tiempo pasa lentamente
Estoy loco por que vuelvas; hace tanto que te fuiste
No te irás a enamorar allí, lo prometiste

[Pre-estribillo 1]
Por favor, cuando puedas, llámame
Que mi soledad y yo, sin ti no nos llevamos bien
Me paso el día planeando nuestro encuentro imaginario
Oh, no, no

[Estribillo]
Te besaré como nadie en este mundo te besó
Te amaré con el cuerpo y con la mente
Con la piel y el corazón
Vuelve pronto, te esperamos
Mi soledad y yo…

Te besaré como nadie en este mundo te besó
Te amaré con el cuerpo y con la mente
Con la piel y el corazón
Vuelve pronto, te esperamos
Mi soledad y yo

[Verso 3]
Ya no te entretengo más; sé que te está esperando alguien
Dile que debe hablar más bajo, al que ha dicho que no tardes
Solo un último favor te pido antes de colgar
Dile que te cuide mucho; ¿me prometes que lo harás?

[Pre-estribillo 2]
Y ahora, cálmate
Que no note que has llorado
Disimula que estás bien, como yo lo hago
Y mientras, seguiré pensando en nuestro encuentro imaginario
No, no, no, no…

Te besaré como nadie en este mundo te besó
Te amaré con el cuerpo y con la mente
Con la piel y el corazón
Vuelve pronto, te esperamos
Mi soledad y yo…

…Como nadie en este mundo te besó
Te amaré… con la piel y el corazón
Mi soledad y yo…

Te besaré como nadie en este mundo te besó
Te amaré con el cuerpo y con la mente
Con la piel y el corazón
Vuelve pronto, te esperamos
Mi soledad y yo

Amiga mía, lo sé, solo vives por él, que lo sabe también
Pero él no te ve como yo, suplicarle a mi boca
Que diga que me ha confesado entre copas
Que es con tu piel con quien sueña de noche
Y que enloquece con cada botón
Que te desabrochas pensando en sus manos
Él no te ha visto temblar, esperando
Una palabra, algún gesto, un abrazo
Él no te ve como yo suspirando
Con los ojitos abiertos de par en par
Escucharme nombrarle
Ay, amiga mía, lo sé y él también

Amiga mía, no sé que decir, ni que hacer para verte feliz

Amiga mía, ojalá algún día, escuchando mi canción, de pronto entiendas
Que lo que nunca quise fue contar tu historia
Porque pudiera resultar conmovedora

Está es mi manera de decir las cosas
No es que sea mi trabajo, es que es mi idioma

¡Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin agua!
Me encantaría quererte un poco menos
¡Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin ti!

[Pre-Coro]
Pero no puedo, siento que muero
Me estoy ahogando sin tu amor

[Coro]
¡Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin aire!
¡Cómo quisiera calmar mi aflicción!
¡Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin agua!
Me encantaría robar tu corazón

[Verso 2]
¿Cómo pudiera un pez nadar sin agua?
¿Cómo pudiera un ave volar sin alas?
¿Cómo pudiera la flor crecer sin tierra? (Oh no)
¡Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin ti!
¡Oh no!

[Pre-Coro]
Pero no puedo, siento que muero
Me estoy ahogando sin tu amor

[Coro]
¡Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin aire!
¡Cómo quisiera calmar mi aflicción!
¡Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin agua!
Me encantaría robar tu corazón
¡Cómo quisiera lanzarte al olvido!
¡Cómo quisiera guardarte en un cajón!
¡Cómo quisiera borrarte de un soplido!
Me encantaría matar esta canción

14928,En El Muelle De San Blas,Maná,"[Letra de ""En El Muelle de San Blás""]

[Intro]
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh

[Verso 1]
Ella despidió a su amor, él partió en un barco en el muelle de San Blas
Él juró que volvería y empapada en llanto, ella juró que esperaría
Miles de lunas pasaron y siempre ella estaba en el muelle esperando
Muchas tardes se anidaron, se anidaron en su pelo y en su' labios

[Interludio]
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh

[Verso 2]
Llevaba el mismo vestido y por si él volviera no se fuera a equivocar
Los cangrejos le mordían, su ropaje, su tristeza y su ilusión
Y el tiempo se escurrió, y sus ojos se le llenaron de amaneceres
Y del mar se enamoró, y su cuerpo se enraizó en el muelle

[Coro]
Sola, sola en el olvido
Sola, sola con su espíritu
Sola, con su amor el mar
Sola, en el muelle de San Blas

[Verso 3]
Su cabello se blanqueó, pero ningún barco a su amor le devolvía
Y en el pueblo le decían, lee decían la loca del muelle de San Blas
Y una tarde de abril, la intentaron trasladar al manicomio
Nadie la pudo arrancar, y del mar nunca jamás la separaron

[Coro]
Sola, sola en el olvido
Sola, sola con su espíritu
Sola, con su amor el mar
Sola, en el muelle de San Blas

[Interludio]
Oh, oh-oh

[Coro]
Sola, sola en el olvido
Sola, sola con su espíritu
Sola, sola con el sol y el mar
Sola, oh sola
Sola en el olvido
Sola, sola con su espíritu
Sola, con su amor el mar
Sola, en el muelle de San blas

[Interludio]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Se quedó, se quedó sola, sola
Se quedó, se quedó don el sol y con el mar
Se quedó ahí, se quedó hasta el fin
Se quedó ahí, se quedó en el muelle de San Blas
Woh, oh-oh-oh
Sola, sola se quedó
Woh, oh-oh-oh

14943,Mariposa Traicionera,Maná,"[Letra de ""Mariposa traicionera""]

[Verso 1]
Eres como una mariposa
Vuelas y te posas, vas de boca en boca
Fácil y ligera de quien te provoca
Yo soy ratón de tu ratonera
Trampa que no mata, pero no libera
Vivo muriendo prisionero

[Pre-Coro]
Mariposa traicionera
Todo se lo lleva el viento
Mariposa, no regreso

[Coro]
Ay, mariposa de amor, mi mariposa de amor
Ya no regreso contigo
Ay, mariposa de amor, mi mariposa de amor
Nunca jamas junto a ti

[Pos-Coro]
Vuela amor, vuela dolor
Y no regreses a un lado
Ya vete de flor en flor
Seduciendo a los pistilos
Y vuela cerca del sol
Pa' que sientas lo que es dolor

[Verso 2]
Ay, mujer como haces daño
Pasan los minutos cual si fueran años
Mira estos celos, me están matando
Ay, mujer, que fácil eres
Abres tus alitas, muslos de colores
Donde se posan tus amores

[Pre-Coro]
Mariposa traicionera
Todo se lo lleva el viento
Mariposa no regreso

Ay, mariposa de amor, mi mariposa de amor
Ya no regreso contigo

14925,Yo No Soy Esa Mujer,Paulina Rubio,"[Verso 1]
Tienes una idea falsa del amor
Nunca fue un contrato ni una imposición
Y aunque te quiero cada vez más
De un modo que no puedes ni sospechar

Yo no soy esa mujer
Que no sale de casa y que pone a tus pies lo mejor de su alma
No me convertiré en el eco de tu voz, en un rincón

Te obligaré a que entiendas esta lección

Nunca me verás llorar aunque sienta deseos más de una vez
Yo no soy esa mujer

Nunca me verás llorar, no, no, no; nunca me verás caer, no, no, no
Nunca me verás perdida, llorando, consentida, oh, no

14908,Pasos de cero,Pablo Alborán,"Entre tu boca y la mía
Hay un cuento de hadas que siempre acaba bien
Entre las sábanas frías
Me pierdo a solas pensando en tu piel

Que curiosa la vida
Que de pronto sorprende con este loco amor
Y es que todo se acaba
Y termina si dejo de ser lo que soy

Bésame no dudes ni un segundo de mi alma
Alteras mis sentidos, liberas mis alas
No cabe tanto amor en esta cama
Si me dejaras...

Qué bueno es sentir que suspiro de nuevo
Que tu roce y mi roce juntos forman fuego
Delicada llama que nunca se apaga

Sin ti yo me pierdo
Sin ti me vuelvo veneno
No entiendo el despertar sin un beso de esos
Sin tu aliento en mi cuello (x2)

Qué futuro más bello
Qué plan más perfecto presiento
No tendremos que estar batallando
Buscando siempre el momento

Por dar pasos de cero y un camino certero de sueños
Liberamos el llanto vacío que tanto provocan los miedos

Bésame no dudes ni un segundo de mi alma
Alteras mis sentidos, liberas mis alas
No cabe tanto amor en esta cama, si me dejaras...

Qué bueno es sentir que suspiro de nuevo
Que tu roce y mi roce juntos forman fuego
Delicada llama que nunca se apaga

Sin ti yo me pierdo
Sin ti me vuelvo veneno
No entiendo el despertar sin un beso de esos
Sin tu aliento en mi cuello (x2)

Que ya es hora de empezar
Algo enserio
Y creo que nada me impide decirte que estaría bien

Tocarnos una vez y otra vez

14922,Amor,Cristian Castro,"Dónde está el amor?
Alguien lo ha encontrado por favor o no?
Dónde puede ir?
Puede estar herido, pero no morir
Puede estar cansado
Puede estar encadenado
Quizás esté dormido
A la sombra de un olvido

Amor, amor
Que te pintas de cualquier color
Tan profundo como el viento
Tan lejano como el tiempo
Y tan cierto como el sol

Amor, amor
Si me escuchas si me puedes ver
No me cierres tu guarida
Llena un poco de mi vida
Llena un poco de mi ser

Dónde puede estar
El amor que un día se llebo la mar
Cuando volverá?
Puede que no vuelva nunca más, quizás
Puede estar herido
Puede estar desfallecido
Quizás esté sentado
A la puerta del pasado

Amor, amor
Que te pintas de cualquier color
Tan profundo como el viento
Tan lejano como el tiempo
Y tan cierto como el sol

Amor, amor
Si me escuchas si me puedes ver
No me cierres tu guarida
Llena un poco de mi vida
Llena un poco de mi ser

[Verso 1]
Quien diría que el mink y la mezclilla
Podrían fundirse un día, quién diría
Tú caviar y yo tortilla, quién diría
Parece que el amor no entiende de plusvalías
Tú vas al banco y yo prefiero la alcancía
Oigo Serrat y tú prefieres Locomía
Tú vas al punto yo voy por la fantasía
Parece que el amor no entiende de ironías

[Coro]
Quién diría, quién diría que son años
Los que ya llevamos juntos de la mano
Quién diría, quién diría que lo importante
Es aceptarte y que me aceptes como humano
Si que te amo y que me ames es una ironía
Que bendición la mía
Despertar junto a ti cada día

[Verso 2]
Yo trovador y tú estudiante de economía
Tú con los números, yo con la filosofía
Y aunque suene imposible en teoría
Al amor le importa poco las utopías
Dice la gente que tú y yo no hacemos compañía
Por ser agua y aceite, que ironía
Si fuesemos iguales, que apatía
No tendríamos de que hablar cada siguiente día

[Coro]
Quién diría, quién diría que son años
Los que ya llevamos juntos de la mano
Quién diría, quién diría que lo importante
Es aceptarte y que me aceptes como humano
Quién diría, quién diría que son años

Verás que todo es posible
Vuela, vuela
Despierta tu mente

No te hace falta equipaje
Vuela, vuela
Nadie controla tu imagen

14916,La soledad,Laura Pausini,"[Estrofa 1]
Marco se ha marchado para no volver
El tren de la mañana llega ya sin él
Es sólo un corazón con alma de metal
En esa niebla gris que envuelve la ciudad

Su banco está vacío, Marco sigue en mí
Le siento respirar, pienso que sigue aquí
Ni la distancia enorme puede dividir
Dos corazones y un solo latir

[Coro]
Quizá si tú piensas en mí
Si a nadie tú quieres hablar
Si tú te escondes como yo
Si huyes de todo y si te vas

Pronto a la cama sin cenar
Si aprietas fuerte contra ti
La almohada y te echas a llorar
Si tú no sabes cuanto mal

Te hará la soledad
Na nai nai nai na na
Na nai na
Na nai na

[Estrofa 2]
Miro en mi diario tu fotografía
Con ojos de muchacho un poco tímido
La aprieto contra el pecho y me parece que
Estás aquí entre inglés y matemáticas

Tu padre y sus consejos que monotonía
Por causa del trabajo y otras tonterías
Te ha llevado lejos sin contar contigo
Te ha dicho: un día lo comprenderás

[Coro]
Quizá si tú piensas en mí
Con los amigos te verás
Tratando sólo de olvidar
No es nada fácil la verdad

En clase ya no puedo más
Y por las tardes es peor
No tengo ganas de estudiar
Por ti mi pensamiento va

Es imposible dividir así
La vida de los dos
Por eso espérame, cariño mio
Conserva la ilusión

La soledad entre los dos
Este silencio en mi interior
Esta inquietud de ver pasar así
La vida sin tu amor

Por eso, espérame porque
Esto no puede suceder
Es imposible separar así
La historia de los dos

La soledad entre los dos
Este silencio en mi interior
Esa inquietud de ver pasar así
La vida sin tu amor

Por eso, espérame porque
Esto no puede suceder
Es imposible separar así
La historia de los dos
La soledad

[Verse 1: Thalía, Prince Royce]
Te entregué mi piel
Me mudé en tu ser
Sólo quise ser ésa mujer
Siempre te cuidé
Nunca te fui infiel
Y te amé, te juro
Como a nadie

[Pre-Chorus: Thalía, Prince Royce]
I wanna know
Just let me know
How could you let me walk away?
I wanna know
I gotta know
How could you just take my love away?
After all that we made
Somebody please explain!

[Chorus: Thalía, Prince Royce]
Te perdiste mi amor y yo
Y yo te estaba amando
Te perdiste mi amor and you don’t know
Dejaste mi cama llorando
Cada uno perdió lo que muchos no han logrado
Ni soñando

[Verse 2: Thalía, Prince Royce]
Saliste a buscar
Y no sabían igual
Ésos besos que yo te entregaba
No pudiste hallar la felicidad
Ésa que tanto deseabas

[Pre-Chorus: Thalía, Prince Royce]
I wanna know
Just let me know
How could you let me walk away?
I wanna know
I gotta know
How could you just take my love away?
After all that we made
Somebody please explain!

[Chorus: Thalía, Prince Royce]
Te perdiste mi amor y yo
Y yo te estaba amando
Te perdiste mi amor and you don’t know
Dejaste mi cama llorando
Cada uno perdió lo que muchos no han logrado
Ni soñando

[Chorus 2: Thalía, Prince Royce]
Te perdiste mi amor y yo
Y yo te estaba amando
Te perdiste mi amor and you don’t know
Dejaste mi cama llorando
Te perdiste mi amor, oh no
Nunca supiste cuánto
Te perdiste mi amor y hoy
Hoy podemos remediarlo

No sé qué nos pasó
¿Por qué no lo intentamos
De nuevo?

14905,Experiencia Religiosa,Enrique Iglesias,"[Letra de ""Experiencia Religiosa""]

Un poco de ti para sobrevivir
Esta noche que viene fria y sola
Un aire de extasis en la ventana
Para vestirme de fiesta y ceremonia

Cada vez que estoy contigo
Yo descubro el infinito
Tiembla el suelo
La noche se ilumina
El silencio se vuelve melodia

Y es casi un
Experiencia religiosa
Sentir que resucito si me tocas
Subir al firmamento prendido de tu
Cuerpo
Es un experiencia religiosa

Casi una experiencia religiosa
Contigo cada instante en cada cosa
Besar la boca tuya merece
Un aleluya
Es una experiencia religiosa

Vuelve pronto mi amor
Te necesito ya
Porque esta noche tan honda
Me da miedo
Necesito la musica de tu alegria
Para callar los demonios que
Llevo dentro

Cada vez que estoy contigo
Yo descubro el infinito
Tiembla el suelo
La noche se ilumina
El silencio se vuelve melodia

Y es casi un
Experiencia religiosa
Sentir que resucito si me tocas
Subir al firmamento
Prendido de tu cuerpo
Es un experiencia religiosa

Casi una experiencia religiosa
Contigo cada instante
En cada cosa
Besar la boca tuya merece
Un aleluya
Es una experiencia religiosa

Y es casi un
Experiencia religiosa
Sentir que resucito si me tocas
Subir al firmamento
Prendido de tu cuerpo

Casi una experiencia religiosa
Contigo cada instante en cada cosa
Besar la boca tuya
Merece un aleluya
Es una experiencia religiosa

Desde esa noche te extraño en mi habitación
Creo que puedo caer en una adicción contigo
No me esperaba jamás una historia así
Siento mil cosas por ti, siento mil cosas

[Chorus: Thalía & Maluma]
Entiende que desde esa noche, solamente pienso en ti
Desde esa noche, muero por tenerte aquí
¿Que es lo que te pasa que no quieres, amor?
Entiende que desde esa noche, solamente pienso en ti

Pero me da miedo enamorarme, de ti

Quiero llenarte de mil cosas y rosas de mil colores

Coqueteando junto a él
Te encontré en aquel café
Pero tus ojos, se clavaron en mí
Te miré y te hice sonreir
Desde aquel día, tú eres mi obsesión
Sé que me sigues por donde voy
Y me espías en cada rincón

Te noto tras mis pasos
Te escondes en mi sombra
Y no comprendo la razón

Me escribes y no firmas jamás
Llamas y no quieres hablar
Envías rosas y poemas de amor
Y te siento siempre alrededor
¿Qué misterioso asunto ocultarás?
¿Porqué secretamente vienes y vas?
No dejas huellas pero sé que estás

Te noto tras mis pasos
Te escondes en mi sombra
Y ya estoy harto de jugar

14900,Nunca Voy A Olvidarte,Cristian Castro,"[Verso]
Junte lo más hermoso
Que viví yo contigo
Los detalles las cosas
Que me harán recordarte
Ahora voy a marcharme
Pues tú lo decidiste
Lo comprendo y me alejo
No sin antes decirte

[Estribillo]
Que el tiempo que duró nuestro amor
Tú me hiciste feliz
Y en mi adios te deseo lo mejor
Pero estés donde estés
Nunca voy a olvidarte
Yo te juro que no
Trataré de olvidarme
Si tú quieres mi amor
Para mi no me importa
Yo te quiero a morir
Sobre todas las cosas

14930,Hacer El Amor Con Otro,Alejandra Guzman,"[Letra de ""Hacer el amor con otro (En vivo)""]

[Inicio]
Y esta canción quiero que la canten conmigo
Es el éxito de mi carrera, es más importante

[Verso 1]
Amanecer con él
A mi costado no es igual que estar contigo
No es que esté mal, ni hablar
Pero le falta madurar, es casi un niño

[Verso 2]
Blanco como el yogur
Sin ese toro que tú llevas en el pecho
Fragilidad de flor
Nada que ver con mi perverso favorito

[Pre-Coro 1]
Sin tus uñas arañándome la espalda
Sin tus manos que me estrujan, todo cambia
Sin tu lengua envenenando mi garganta
Sin tus dientes que torturan y endulzan, yo no siento nada

[Coro]
Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no
No es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa
No destilan los poros del cuerpo
Ambrosía salpicada de te quieros
Hacer el amor con otro no, no, no
Es como no hacer nada, falta fuego en la mirada
Falta dar el ama en cada beso
Y sentir que puedes alcanzar el cielo

[Verso 3]
Quise olvidarte con él
Quise vengar todas tus infidelidades
Y me salió tan mal
Que hasta me cuesta respirar su mismo aire

[Pre-Coro 2]
Los mechones de tu pelo negro crespo
Tus caderas afiladas y escurridas
Esa barba que raspaba como lija
Y tu sonrisa retorcida son lo mejor que hay en mi vida

[Coro]
Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no
No es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa
No destilan los poros del cuerpo
Ambrosía salpicada de te quieros
Hacer el amor con otro no, no, no
Es como no hacer nada falta fuego en la mirada
Falta dar el ama en cada beso
Y sentir que puedes alcanzar el cielo

[Fin]
Quise olvidarte con él

Cómo duele el día nublado
Cómo el tiempo es tan pesado
Sí, porque a diario pienso en ti

Qué bien grita el silencio
Qué bien duelen los recuerdos
Sí, porque todo habla de ti

[Pre-Coro]
Qué delicia tu sensualidad
Qué locura cuando te sentía muy de cerca (Muy de cerca)
Y ahora que estás lejos hasta el universo ha muerto

[Coro]
¿Cómo fue que tu dejaste de querer?
¿Te olvidaste del ayer?
¿De nuestras miradas, de nuestra piel?
¿No te duele así perder
Lo que fue perfecto y acordado fiel?
Lo que me queda por decir
Es cómo duele perderte
Ay, ay ,ay, ay, ay cómo me duele

[Verso 2]
Qué pequeño se hace el cielo
Qué humillante es el deseo
Sí, porque ya no estás aquí

Qué sincero se hace el frío
Como hiel mi sufrimiento
Ya no sé lo que es vivir

Qué delicia tu sensualidad
Qué locura cuando te sentía muy de cerca (Muy de cerca)
Y ahora que estás lejos hasta el universo ha muerto

[Verso 1]
Tú, llegaste a mi vida para enseñarme
Tú, supiste encenderme y luego apagarme
Tú, te hiciste indispensable para mí
Y, y, y con los ojos cerrados te seguí
Si yo busqué dolor, lo conseguí
No eres la persona que pensé
Que creí, que pedí

Mientes, me haces daño y luego te arrepientes
Ya no tiene caso que lo intentes
No me quedan ganas de sentir
Llegas cuando estoy a punto de olvidarte
Busca tu camino en otra parte
Mientras busco el tiempo que perdí
Y hoy estoy mejor sin ti

[Verso 2]
Voy, de nuevo recordando lo que soy
Sabiendo lo que das y lo que doy
En mí no queda espacio para ti
Y, y, y, y, y el tiempo hizo lo suyo y comprendí
Las cosas no suceden porque sí
No eres la persona que pensé
Que creí, que pedí

14927,Bajo El Agua,Manuel Medrano,"Letra de ""Bajo el Agua""

Quiero volar contigo, muy alto en algún lugar
Quisiera estar contigo viendo las estrellas sobre el mar
Quiero encontrar otro camino ponerme mi vestido y salir a caminar contigo
Quiero decirle al mundo que no somos amigos, decirle a la tristeza
Que no se cruce en mi camino

Quiero volar contigo, muy alto en algún lugar
Quisiera estar contigo viendo las estrellas sobre el mar
Quiero encontrar otro camino ponerme mi vestido y salir a caminar contigo
Quiero decirle al mundo que no somos amigos, decirle a la tristeza
Que no se cruce en mi camino

Hoy porque voy
Contra la fuerza de un submarino
A conquistar a esa dama que tanto juega conmigo
Voy por el mundo solo y sin amigos
Voy dando tantas vueltas sin ningún sentido
Pero tu ayer cambiaste mi destino
Me diste vida, mucha más vida que el vino
Me diste fuerza en los días fríos
Me diste ganas de extrañarte sin ningún motivo

Quiero encontrar otro camino ponerme mi vestido y salir a caminar contigo
Quiero decirle al mundo que no somos amigos, decirle a la tristeza
Que no se cruce en tu camino
Que no se cruce, no
Que no se cruce, no
Que no se cruce, no

14912,Desnuda,Ricardo Arjona,"[Letra de ""Desnuda""]

[Verso 1]
No es ninguna aberración sexual
Pero me gusta verte andar en cueros
El compás de tus pechos aventureros
Víctimas de la gravedad
¿Será porque no me gusta la tapicería?
Que creo que tu desnudez es tu mejor lencería
Por eso es que me gustas tal y como eres
Incluso ese par de libras de más
Si te viese tu jefe desnuda y detrás
No dudaría en promover tu cintura
Deja llenarme de tu desnudez
Para afrontar los disfraces de afuera
De una mejor manera

[Coro]
Desnuda que no habrá diseño que te quede mejor
Que el de tu piel ajustada a tu figura
Desnuda que no hay un ingenuo que vista una flor
Sería como taparle la hermosura
Desnuda que la naturaleza no se equivoca
Y si te hubiese querido con ropa, con ropa hubieses nacido
Deja llenarme de tu desnudez
Para vestirme por dentro
Aunque sea un momento

[Verso 2]
Y ahora que por fin te tengo así
Desnuda y precisamente enfrente
Desnuda también un poquito la mente
Pon tus complejos juntos de tu ropa
Y si te sientes un poquito loca
Ponte loca completa
Que verte será solo el inicio
Antes de perder el juicio

[Coro]
Desnuda que no habrá diseño que te quede mejor
Que el de tu piel ajustada a tu figura
Desnuda que no hay un ingenuo que vista una flor
Sería como taparle la hermosura
Desnuda que la naturaleza no se equivoca
Y si te hubiese querido con ropa, con ropa hubieses nacido
Deja llenarme de tu desnudez

14938,Tu Pirata Soy Yo,Chayanne,"Quizás somos dos locos incurables
Tal vez somos dos chispas en la oscuridad
Quizás es que lo nuestro quisiera
Tratar de comprender nuestra mejor verdad
Y no importa la distancia de tu puerto
Que pongan siete mares entre tu y yo
No importa soportar las tempestades
Mi faro es tu mirada y tu amor, mi sol

Tu pirata soy yo
Y mi mar es tu corazón
Mi bandera, tu libertad
Mi tesoro poderte amar
Tu pirata soy yo
Tu querido ladron de amor
En mi proa tu nombre va
Tu pirata soy yo

Por qué no han entendido
Que no hay edad
Color, razón ni condición
Ni tiempo para el amor
Eternamente amor navegaremos
Completamente unidos sin mirar atrás
Perdidamente amándonos al viento
Sin nudos en la mente y con la cara al mar
La rueda del timón abrazaremos
Con rumbo a aquella estrella que te promete
Volando en un velero por la espuma
Flotando entre la brisa del azul cristal

Tu pirata soy yo
Y mi mar es tu corazón
Mi bandera, tu libertad
Mi tesoro poderte amar
Tu pirata soy yo
Tu querido ladron de amor
En mi proa tu nombre va
Tu Pirata Soy Yo

Me dice que sí

[Verso 2]
¿Dónde estás, corazón?
Ven, regresa por mí
Que la vida se me vuelve un ocho
Si no estás aquí
Y quiero pensar (Y quiero pensar)
Que no tardarás (Que no tardarás)
Porque en el planeta no existe
Más nadie a quien pueda yo amar

[Coro]
¿Dónde estás, corazón?
Ayer te busqué
¿Dónde estás, corazón?
Y no te encontré

[Verso 3]
¿Dónde estás, corazón?
Saliste de aquí
Ay, buscando quién sabe qué cosas
Tan lejos de mí
Y puedo pensar
Y vuelvo pensar
Que no tardarás (No tardarás)
Porque en el planeta
No existe más nadie
A quien pueda yo amar

[Coro]
¿Dónde estás, corazón?
Ayer te busqué
¿Dónde estás, corazón?
Y no te encontré

[Puente]
Te busqué
En el armario
En el abecedario
Debajo del carro
En el negro, en el blanco
En los libros de historia
En las revistas
En la radio
Te busqué por las calles
En donde tu madre
En cuadros de Botero
En mi monedero
En dos mil religiones
Te busqué hasta
En mis canciones

Hola, ¿cómo estás?
Espero que no del todo mal
Aún no recibo la postal
Que prometiste el día en que te fuiste

[Verso 1]
Puedo imaginar
Lo triste de tu soledad
Mirando toda la ciudad
Dos meses fuera es una larga espera

Yo estoy solo aquí
No sé que más puedo decir
Cuéntame cómo está París
¿Es divertido aunque no estés conmigo?

Más de lo que te imaginas
Me estoy portando mal y me fascina, ie ie oi oi o

Anoche te llamé
Y no estabas en el hotel
Saliste a ver la Torre Eiffel
O fuiste de paseo a un museo

Yo quiero saber
Cómo te va con el francés
Te dieron ganas de volver
O has podido hacer algún amigo

Más de lo que te imaginas
Me estoy portando mal y me fascina, ie ie oi oi o
Más de lo que te imaginas
Me estoy portando mal y me fascina, ie ie oi oi o

Hola, ¿cómo estás?
Sigo esperando tu postal
Debes tener ya que contar
Y desde aquí sospecho que algo has hecho

El tiempo pasó
Más de la cuenta, creo yo
Porque el verano terminó
Y faltan meses para que regreses

Puedo trabajar de sol a sol
Puedo subirme hasta el Himalaya
O batirme con mi espada
Para no perder tu amor

Puedo ser, tu fiel, chofer, mujer

Y es que por tu amor volvía a nacer
Tu fuiste la respiración
Y era tan grande la ilusión
Pero si te vas que voy a hacer
Planchar de nuevo el corazón
Se pone triste esta canción

Quiero
Casarme contigo
Quedarme a tu lado
Ser el bendecido con tu amor
Por eso yo quiero

Puedo mendigar por tu amor
Puedo mudarme a la Castellana
Agua fría por las mañanas
Y alinear en el Unión

14911,Ni Una Sola Palabra,Paulina Rubio,"[Letra de ""Ni Una Sola Palabra""]

[Verso 1]
Le está gritando y hace que no se entera
Ey, corazón, escucha a tu cabeza
Pero, ¿a dónde vas? ¿Me estás escuchando?
¿Qué hay de tu orgullo? ¿Qué habíamos quedado?
La noche empieza y con ella mi camino
Te busco a solas con mi mejor vestido
Pero, ¿a dónde estás? ¿Qué es lo que ha pasado?
¿Qué es lo que queda después de tantos años?

[Pre-Coro]
Miro esos ojos que un día me miraron
Busco tu boca, tus manos, tus abrazos
Pero tú no sientes nada
Y te disfrazas de cordialidad

[Coro]
Ni una sola palabra
Ni gestos, ni miradas apasionadas
Ni rastro de los besos que antes me dabas
Hasta el amanecer, eh, eh, eh (-cer, eh, eh, eh)
Ni una de las sonrisas
Por las que cada noche y todos los días
Sollozan estos ojos
En los que ahora te ves

[Verso 2]
Como un juguete que choca contra un muro
Salgo a encontrarte y me pierdo en cuanto busco
Una oportunidad, un milagro o un hechizo
Volverme guapa y tú guapo conmigo

[Pre-Coro]
Frente a los ojos que un día me miraron
Pongo mi espalda y algunos cuantos pasos
Y me apunto otra derrota
Mientras mi boca dice: ""Nunca más""

Ni una sola palabra
Ni gestos, ni miradas apasionadas
Ni rastro de los besos que antes me dabas
Hasta el amanecer, eh, eh, eh (-cer, eh, eh, eh)

Sollozan estos ojos
En los que ahora te ves

Te conozco desde el pelo hasta la punta de los pies
Sé que roncas por las noches y que duermes de revés
Sé que dices que tienes veinte cuando tienes veintitrés
Te conozco cuando ríes y tus gestos al amar
Sé de aquella cirugía que a nadie le has de contar
Sé que odias la rutina un poco más que a la cocina

Dime si él te conoce la mitad
Dime si él tiene la sensibilidad
De encontrar el punto exacto
Donde explotas al amar
Dime si él te conoce la mitad

De lo que te ama este loco
Que dejaste en libertad

[Verso 2]
Reconozco lo que piensas antes que empieces a hablar
Sé de tus 150 dietas para adelgazar
Sé que padeces de insomnio y que fumas sin parar
Imagino esas charlas que en mi honor han de entablar
Y hasta sé lo que este viernes le has de hacer para cenar
Y es que tanto te conozco que hasta sé, me has de extrañar

14914,Mi Verdad,Maná,"Letra de ""Mi Verdad"" ft. Shakira
Hay mentiras en los labios
Hay mentiras en la piel, que dolor
Hay mentiras, hay amantes
Que por instantes de placer
Ponen su vida a temblar

[Shakira]
Hay mentiras compasivas
Hay mentiras por piedad
Que no quieren lastimar
Hay mentiras que nos hieren de verdad
Ay, ay, ay

Hay engaños que por años
Ocultaron la verdad
Haciendo mucho daño
Ay, yo me voy a refugiar
A la tierra de tu amor (mi verdad)

Tú eres mi amor, mi alegría
La verdad de mi vida
Mi bebe que me salta a los brazos de prisa
Tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad

Oye, tú eres mi amor, mi alegría
La verdad de mi vida
Mi bebe que me calma el alma con risas
Tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad

Hay mentira en la mirada
Hay mentiras en la piel, dibujadas
Hay mentiras, hay amantes
Que por instantes de placer
Ponen su vida a temblar

Hay doctrinas y oradores
Dictadores sin piedad
Que gobiernan sin verdad
Y hay mentiras en los diarios, en las redes
Y en el mar, ay, ay, ay

Hay engaños que por años
Ocultaron la verdad
Hiriendo de dolor
Ay, yo me voy a refugiar
Al oasis de tu amor

Tú eres mi amor, mi alegría
La verdad de mi vida
Mi bebe que me salta a los brazos de prisa
Tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad

Oye, tú eres mi amor, mi alegría
La verdad de mi vida
Mi bebe que me calma el alma con risas
Tú eres mi refugio y mi verdad

En un mundo tan irreal
No sé qué creer
Y amor sé que tú eres mi verdad, eres mi verdad
Tú eres la luz que me guía
Tú eres la voz que me calma
Tú eres la lluvia de mi alma
Y eres toda mi verdad
Tú eres la luz de mi vida
Tú eres la voz que me calma
Tú eres la lluvia de mi alma
Y eres toda mi verdad
Eres toda mi verdad

[Verso 1]
Se me acaba el argumento y la metodología
Cada vez que se aparece frente a mí tu anatomía
Porque este amor ya no entiende de consejos, ni razones
Se alimenta de pretextos y le faltan pantalones

[Pre-Coro]
Este amor no me permite estar en pie
Porque ya hasta me ha quebrado los talones
Aunque me levante volveré a caer
Si te acercas nada es útil para esta inútil

[Coro]
Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido
Por ti me he convertido
En una cosa que no hace
Otra cosa más que amarte
Pienso en ti día y noche
Y no sé cómo olvidarte

[Verso 2]
Cuántas veces he intentado enterrarte en mi memoria
Y aunque diga ""Ya no más"" es otra vez la misma historia
Porque este amor siempre sabe hacerme respirar profundo
Ya me trae por la izquierda y de pelea con el mundo

[Pre-Coro]
Si pudiera exorcizarme de tu voz
Si pudiera escaparme de tu nombre
Si pudiera arrancarme el corazón
Y esconderme para no sentirme nuevamente

Ojerosa, flaca, fea, desgreñada
Torpe, tonta, lenta, necia, desquiciada
Completamente descontrolada
Tú te das cuenta y no me dices nada
Ves que se me ha vuelto la cabeza un nido
Donde solamente tú tienes asilo
Y no me escuchas lo que te digo
Mira bien lo que vas a hacer conmigo

Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido
Por ti me he convertido
En una cosa que no hace
Otra cosa más que amarte

[Verso 1]
Ya sé que no vendrás, todo lo que fue
El tiempo lo dejó atrás, sé que no regresarás
Lo que nos pasó no repetirá jamás
Mil años no me alcanzarán para borrarte y olvidar

[Pre-Coro]
Y ahora estoy aquí queriendo convertir
Los campos en ciudad, mezclando el cielo con el mar
Sé que te dejé escapar, sé que te perdí
Nada podrá ser igual
Mil años pueden alcanzar (Mil años pueden alcanzar)
Para que puedas perdonar

Estoy aquí queriéndote, ahogándome
Entre fotos y cuadernos, entre cosas y recuerdos
Que no puedo comprender

Cambiándome un pie por la cara mía
Esta noche por el día, ¿y qué?
Nada le puedo yo hacer

[Verso 2]
Las cartas que escribí, nunca los envié
No quieras saber de mí
No puedo entender la tonta que fui
Es cuestión de tiempo y fe
Mil años con otros mil más (Mil años con otros mil más)
Son suficientes para amar

Estoy aquí queriéndote, ahogándome
Entre fotos y cuadernos, entre cosas y recuerdos
Que no puedo comprender

14946,Ley De Newton,Beatriz Luengo,"[Letra de ""Ley De Newton"" ft. Jesús Navarro]

Preciosa, ahora que estamos los dos
Acompañando al silencio
Que vino a este encuentro entre tu voz y mi voz

Quisiera no equivocar la ocasión
Busco palabras perfectas entre mi conciencia
Y lo que está en mi razón

Y cuanto más y más y más intento romper el hielo
Miro tus ojos frente a mí brillando como un caramelo
Y quiero dejar de ser, de estar y pido a dios que se pare el tiempo
Entonces suspiras, te toco, y muero

Sólo quiero mirarte y olvidar el pasado
Reducir el espacio entre tu piel y mis manos
No digas lo siento
No existe lamento
Lo quiero todo, todo para mí
Te confieso que quise y no pude olvidarme
De tu dulce sonrisa y tus pequeños detalles
Llegado el momento
No existe lamento
Y quiero todo, todo para mí

Propongo una tregua entre tú y yo
Dejemos atrás la batalla, colguemos las armas
Y bandera blanca pa' el corazón

Seguro [seguro] que no saldrá bien la ecuación
Porque el amor no es perfecto
Y es que lo perfecto no le agrada a la pasión

Y cuanto más y más y más intento romper el hielo
Pierdo la gravedad y siento por segundos que me caigo al suelo
Y siento que es verdad y que la ley de newton no se equivoca [no se equivoca]
Porque suspiras, te toco y muero

Sólo quiero mirarte y olvidar el pasado
Reducir el espacio entre tu piel y mis manos
No digas lo siento
No existe lamento
Lo quiero todo, todo para mí
Te confieso que quise y no pude olvidarme
De tu dulce sonrisa y tus pequeños detalles
Llegado el momento
No existe lamento
Y quiero todo, todo para mí

Todo, todo, todo
Todo, todo, todo

Lo quiero todo, todo para mí

¿Cómo pude ser tan ciego para no reconocerte?
Teniéndote de frente, teniéndote de frente
Quizás sea mi culpa y no haya sido solo mala suerte
El no poder tenerte, el no poder tenerte
Y aquí estoy desesperado
Por todos esos besos que nunca te he dado
Esperando mi turno para defenderme
Sentado en el banquillo de los acusados
Me quedan tantas lunas llenas hoy vacías
Señoras y señores; les doy mi jurado
¿Qué hace un enamorado sin la poesía?
¿Y qué hace un ciego cuando de repente ve?

[Coro]
Vuelve a mí, que aún queda tanto amor
Si no interpreté las señales, no fue culpa mía
Fue porque te quería
Solo vuelve a mí, todo va a estar mejor
Tan solo con volver a verte, todo cambiaría
Y un ciego por amor vería

[Verso 2]
¿Cómo no te pude ver?
Si no estás conmigo qué voy a hacer
Contigo soy débil y me hago el fuerte
Soy ciego y no pude reconocerte (Ouh, no)
Pero siempre me equivoco y llego tarde
Vestido de valiente cuando yo soy un cobarde
El dulce de tus besos me hace falta, me quema y me arde
Recuerdo cada cosa que perdí esa tarde cuando me dejaste solo
Te tuve a mi lado y ahora estoy solo
Rompiendo por fuera y por dentro lloro
Si muero de amor sé que en otra vida de ti vuelvo y me enamoro

[Coro]
Vuelve a mí, que aún queda tanto amor
Si no interpreté las señales, no fue culpa mía
Fue porque te quería
Solo vuelve a mí, que todo va a estar mejor
Te prometo que me arrepiento, amor de cada día
Sin ver que te perdía, me alejé de ti
Yo estaba ciego, amor
Tan solo con volver a verte todo cambiaría
Porque que volvieras a quererme, mi vida
Y un ciego por amor vería

14985,Hoy Se Me Olvida,Chucho Rivas,"Mi peor error fue haberte dado amor
Si nunca te importó
Todo te entregué

Estoy cansado de que siempre a mí me dañen
Sacaré tus espinas y seguiré mi vida

Porque hoy se me olvida
Que tú no me querías
Con este trago borraré todo el dolor

Porque hoy te me olvidas
Sanaré mis heridas
Voy a bailar hasta que se aparezca el sol

Y se me olvide tu amor
Y se me olvide tu amor
Y se me olvide tu amor
Y se me olvide tu amor

Que me querías
Que eras el amor de mi vida
Me faltan dedos pa' contarte las mentiras
Y yo tan tonto que siempre te las creía
Tú belleza a mí ciego te tenía

¿Cómo fui a caer en tu juego?
Me da coraje la mala suerte que tengo
Pero está noche te voy a olvidar
Y sé que no me vas a dañar
Porque, porque

Porque hoy se me olvida
Que tú no me querías
Con este trago borraré todo el dolor

Porque hoy te me olvidas

Voy bajando y voy sin freno

Yo sé que vamos por los 20
Pero date cuenta lo difícil que ha sido tenerte a lado mío
No sé porque te empeñas en hacerme sufrir
Si te dije que: ""Yo también te puedo herir""
No sé si haces lo que haces por hacerte sentir
Si esa foto no dice la verdad de ti

La razón de mi locura
¡No soy nada!
Sin la luz de tu mirada
Sin el eco de tu risa
Que se cuela en mi ventana
Eres dueño del calor
Sobre mi almohada
De mis noches de nostalgia
De mis sueños y esperanzas

[Chorus]
Eres piel morena
Canto de pasión y arena
Eres piel morena
Noche bajo las estrellas
Eres piel morena
Playa, sol y palmeras
Eres piel morena
Sueño de mi primavera

[Post-Chorus]
Son tus besos
Dulce fruta que me embriaga
Que se lleva mis tristezas
Y devuelve al fin la calma
Prisionera de tu amor en la alborada
De tus besos, tus caricias
Que se quedan en el alma

[Chorus]
Eres piel morena
Canto de pasión y arena
Eres piel morena
Noche bajo la estrellas
Eres piel morena
Playa, sol y palmeras
Eres piel morena
Sueño de mi primavera

[Post-Chorus]
Son tus besos
Dulce fruta que me embriaga
Que se lleva mis tristezas
Y devuelve al fin la calma
Prisionera de tu amor en la alborada
De tus besos, tus caricias
Que se quedan en el alma

[Bridge]
Piel morena eres cumbia, sol y arena
Piel morena, mi delirio y mi condena

Es la magia de tu cuerpo
O el perfume de tu aliento
Es el fuego de tu hoguera
Que me tiene prisionera
¡Ay caramba!

Piel morena eres cumbia, sol y arena
Piel morena, mi delirio y mi condena

Eres suave como el viento
Eres dulce pensamiento
Eres sol de mis trigales
Eres miel de mis cañales

[Post-Chorus]
Son tus besos
Dulce fruta que me embriaga
Que se lleva mis tristezas
Y devuelve al fin la calma
Prisionera de tu amor en la alborada
De tus besos, tus caricias
Que se quedan en el alma

[Outro]
Eres piel morena
Canto de pasión y arena
Eres piel morena
Noche bajo las estrellas
Eres piel morena
Playa, sol y palmeras
Eres piel morena
Sueño de mi primavera
Eres piel morena
Porque sólo a tu lado soy feliz
Eres piel morena
Tengo tantas cosas para ti
Eres piel morena
Confundiéndome en tu hoguera lentamente
Eres piel morena
¡Tú me tienes prisionera!

El sol calienta
Más de la cuenta
En días de invierno
La noche es lenta
Es casi eterna
Si así lo quiero
Lo agrio es dulce
Lo malo es bueno
Lo bueno es insuperable

[Coro]
Todo se hace fácil cuando estás aquí
Paseando tu figura en mi cuarto
Todo lo que busco lo he encontrado aquí
Amarrado a tu cintura, pegadito

[Verso 2]
Pegadito
Despacito
Así te quiero
Se siente el aire
Más liviano
Más calientito
Bajo la luna
Nuestro baile
Es casi un tren imparable

[Coro]
Todo se hace fácil cuando estás aquí
Paseando tu figura en mi cuarto
Todo lo que busco lo he encontrado aquí
Amarrado a tu cintura, pegadito

[Puente]
Pegado al imán de tu pecho
Voy dejandome llevar por el vaivén de tu pelo
Me gusta cuando muerdes tus labios
Como queriendo decir:
""¡Oye! ¿Tú qué estás esperando?""

[Coro]
Todo es posible cuando estás aquí
Paseando tu hermosura en mi cuarto
Todo lo que busco lo he encontrado aquí
Amarrado a tu cintura, pegadito

Cuando yo te vi con otra, fue lo que sentí
Te quiero pa' mí
Ere' una calle rota, serpiente venenosa
Anoche soñé que estabas aquí

[Verse 1]
Well, I got a feeling these scars won't ever look like they're old news
If I let you keep on rubbin' salt into all my open wounds
I wish I could keep everything that you took of me but the photos
But you keep a piece of me locked in a secret spot we called home

Solita, solita
Bailando aquí sola
Como a mí me gusta
Solita, solita
Bailando aquí sola
Es mejor que con el diablo

Rooted in your ways, you won't ever know, you won't ever stay

14982,Si por mi fuera,Beret,"[Letra de ""Si Por Mi Fuera""]

[Coro]
Si por mí fuera, si por mí fuera
Haría lo imposible por tenerte entera, ay-ay-ay
Que si por mí fuera serías el aire que mueve mi bandera
Si por mí fuera, si por mí fuera
Te llevaría conmigo incluso aunque me duela, ay-ay-ay
Que si por mí fuera inventaría un camino solo a tus caderas

[Verso 1]
Yo le dije: ""arréglate"", sin referirme a la ropa
Y ella me dijo: ""no sé, tampoco me veo tan rota""
Yo era tan poco y como ella habían tan pocas
Lo más normal que tenía es que parecía tan loca
Yo era el cantante y ella daba la nota
Me contaba mil historias, pero yo nunca era el prota
Ella amaba la lluvia y yo que iba a cuentagotas
Ella ya cambió por otro y yo no la cambio por otra

[Coro]
Si por mí fuera, si por mí fuera
Haría lo imposible por tenerte entera, ay-ay-ay
Que si por mí fuera serías el aire que mueve mi bandera
Si por mí fuera, si por mí fuera
Te llevaría conmigo incluso aunque me duela, ay-ay-ay
Que si por mí fuera inventaría un camino solo a tus caderas

[Verso 2]
Ella quería cambiarme todo lo que yo no pude antes
Y me robaba el tiempo como si me sobraran instantes
Por más que me quitase, si me llamaba nunca iba tarde
Era como un veneno, pero lo bebo para saciarme
Y parece buena, incluso estando a malas
Y yo la llamo ""cielo"", porque con ella me salen alas
Y algo en mí se me para cuando ella se separa
Sé que la necesito y eso no es bueno, pero me calma
Normal que frene y que frene si ella acelera y me puede
Después me da la vida y se va, se va
Sabe lo que debe y no quiere, ya que quererme no debe
Ella pregunta y yo le respondo ""ya qué""

[Coro]
Si por mí fuera, si por mí fuera
Haría lo imposible por tenerte entera, ay-ay-ay
Que si por mí fuera serías el aire que mueve mi bandera
Si por mí fuera, si por mí fuera
Te llevaría conmigo incluso aunque me duela, ay-ay-ay
Que si por mí fuera inventaría un camino solo a tus caderas

[Puente]
No sé por qué me das la vida y luego me matas
No sé, yo quiero olvidarte y tú mejor me tratas
No sé, para ti tanto es solo juego y no es más nada
Y no sé, tú eras siempre la pistola y yo la bala
No sé, te encanta jugar con fuego y hay mil llamas
No sé, ¿hasta dónde llegaremos? Dime dónde
No sé, yo tan solo veo miedo, un querer, pero no puedo
Y no sé lo que hacer

[Coro]
Si por mí fuera, si por mí fuera
Haría lo imposible por tenerte entera, ay-ay-ay
Que si por mí fuera serías el aire que mueve mi bandera
Si por mí fuera, si por mí fuera
Te llevaría conmigo incluso aunque me duela, ay-ay-ay
Que si por mí fuera inventaría un camino solo a tus caderas

No está en mí olvidarte
Te siento aquí abrazándome

[Pre-Coro]
Respirándome, temblando sobre mí, es así
Aunque te fuiste no me suelto de ti

[Coro]
Yo quiero que sigas en mi vida
Yo quiero que vivas en mi piel
Sí amarte es tan fuerte todavía
¿Qué gano olvidándote?
No quiero cerrar estas heridas
No quiero curarme del ayer
Prefiero llorarte de alegría
Soñando que piensas en volver

[Verso 2]
Mírame, no cambié
Soy el mismo ciego
Estoy en paz, te di mi amor y más
Aunque digan que yo me quedé atrás
Ahí después
Porque algún día serás mía otra vez

[Chorus]
Yo quiero que sigas en mi vida
Yo quiero que vivas en mi piel
Sí amarte es tan fuerte todavía

Vuelvo a los brazos de mi vieja cuando frío tengo
Vuelvo a buscarme en tu mirada cuando no pretendo, cuando estoy cansada
Y antes de saltar, vuelvo
Pa que me des un besito en la frente, y vuelvo
Y vuelvo a ser valiente
Desorientada en la masa espero a que vuelvas
A que vuelvas y me encuentres
Porque volver es amar intenso, volver, volver es amar de nuevo
Yo vuelvo, repito, repito y vuelvo, porque volver es amar sin espacio ni tiempo

[Pre-coro]
Te amo despierta, te amo a escondida
Te amo mañana, te amo cerquita
Te amo más o menos, mucho, demasiado
Te amo si no quiero, te amo bien tarde o temprano
Te amo agradecida, te amo sin vergüenza
Te amo con tus huellas, te amo con paciencia
Te amo en silencio, te amo con canción
No sé si amarte es bueno, no amarte es mucho peor

Vuelvo, vuelvo, vuelvo

[Verso 2]
Cuando estoy volviendo a veces vuelvo lento
A veces me pierdo bailando con el viento
Deja la puerta abierta, que yo vuelvo
Te juro que yo vuelvo
Volviendo me encuentro, encontrando yo ando
Reviso debajo de las piedras el pasado
Si me encuentras por ahí, agárrame y vuelve
Que nos devuelvan lo que nos quitaron

14974,Locos Dementes,Gusi,"[Letra de ""Locos Dementes"" Ft. Greeicy & Mike Bahía]

Ella va caminando desnuda en una cama de estrella
Mi conciencia que se pierda en aquella botella
Y Su sonrisa va envolviendo una magia tan bella

Ella esta caliente como sol que arde en la arena
Y aunque no quiera y me esconda su pasión me quema
Con ese fuego que le pertenece solo a ella

Me gusta así así así así asi
Locos dementes y así así me gusta a mi
Tan natural como las olas en el mar
Ya nos queremos enamorar

Si de casualidad te doy un beso imprudente
Y damos rienda suelta a lo que estaba pendiente
Ay que vas a hacer conmigo , que voy a hacer contigo

Porque de amor estamos de locos dementes

Caminando entre la gente por la calle yo te vi
No pude detenerte y los pasos te segui
Despacio, nos fuimos acercando
Con tus ojos yo me encontré y tu estabas mirandome

Me gusta así así así así asi
Locos dementes y así así me gusta a mi
Tan natural como las olas en el mar
Ya nos queremos enamorar

Si de casualidad te doy un beso imprudente
Y damos rienda suelta a lo que estaba pendiente
Ay que vas a hacer conmigo , que voy a hacer contigo
Porque de amor estamos Locos dementes

Ella si me quiere y se me suben los niveles y tiene claro que me gusta asi
No hay quien la supere
Y Tiene en regla los papeles
Y siempre baila pegadita al bip

Ella me tiene volando
Ella me esta enamorando

Dice que no espere, que ya no frene
Que por su boca yo me perdi

Me tiene llevado y demas sobre girao
Estoy loquito loco de emoción
Y esa boquita de melao
Ella me tiene condenado a entregarle mi corazón
Y siento que le calma mi vaina mi vaina mi vaina
Me gusta como me baila me baila me baila
Con sabor Me vuelvo loco por su amor

Ay ay ay te tengo cerca pero quiero mas
Me tiene en una nube
Que sube sube sube
Ando en una locura que no puedo parar..


Si de casualidad te doy un beso imprudente
Y damos rienda suelta a lo que estaba pendiente
Ay que vas a hacer conmigo , que voy a hacer contigo

Porque de amor estamos de locos dementes

Me gusta así así así así asi

Tan natural como las olas en el mares

¿Cuántos besos quedan en el aire?
¿Cuántas veces vamos a intentarlo?
Otra boca no me sabe igual
Otra vez que yo vuelvo a llamar
Y de nuevo vuelves a colgar
Este no puede ser nuestro final

[Coro: Richard, Lali]
¿Cómo así que no duele?
¿Cómo así  que no quieres verme?
Si siempre cuando llega el viernes
Dices que no quieres perderme
¿Cómo así que no duele?
¿Cómo así  que no quieres verme?
Al menos dímelo de frente
No te hagas el que no sientes

[Verso 2: Erick & Lali]
Tú no eres de piedra, ni yo soy de hielo
Vamos a dejarnos de una vez de juegos
Vamo' a perdonarnos y a empezar de cero
Vamos a apostar quién besará primero

[Verso 3: Joel & Lali]
Yo te llevo a cenar al mejor restaurant
Y te llevo a bailar a la orilla del mar
Ya no peleemos más (No, no, no)
Nos hace tanto mal

[Verso 4: Zabdiel & Lali]
Siempre te haces la fuerte
Aprendí a olvidarte pa' después quererte
Esto de nosotros no es cuestión de suerte (No)
Si yo a ti te quise antes de conocerte (No)

[Coro: Lali, Christopher, Zabdiel]
¿Cómo así que no duele?
¿Cómo así  que no quieres verme? (No, no, no)
Si siempre cuando llega el viernes
Dices que no quieres perderme
¿Y cómo así que no duele? (Cómo así, cómo así, cómo así)
¿Cómo así  que no quieres verme? (Cómo así, cómo así, cómo así)
Al menos dímelo de frente
No te hagas la que no sientes

[Post-coro: Zabdiel]
Cómo así, cómo así, cómo así (Yeah)
Cómo así, cómo así, cómo así (Yeah, yeah)

[Puente: Lali]
Otra boca no me sabe igual
Otra vez que yo vuelvo a llamar
Y de nuevo vuelves a colgar
Este no puede ser nuestro final

[Coro: Joel, Lali, Lali & CNCO]
¿Cómo así que no duele?
¿Cómo así  que no quieres verme?
Si siempre cuando llega el viernes
Dices que no quieres perderme
¿Cómo así que no duele?
¿Cómo así  que no quieres verme?

No te hagas el que no sientes

[Verso 1]
Para variar, por fin hoy pienso en mí aunque quiera tenerte
Pero no soy tan fuerte para superarte
Por qué me aferró a que no fue un final sino un alto en el cuento
O en otro día lo intento, voy a recuperarte

[Pre-Coro]
Y es que no quiero ilusionarme porque yo sé cómo es la vida
Pero nunca supe cómo darte por perdida

Así que enamórate de alguien más
Reemplázame que no soy capaz
De olvidarte, de olvidarte
Por favor, ayúdame con el dolor
E ignórame que estaré mejor
Sin hablarte, sin hablarte
Dame una excusa para odiarte
Porque yo no pude jamás
Enamórate de alguien más

[Verso 2]
Lo más difícil fue siempre luchar contra lo inolvidable
Contra un recuerdo amable de tu voz
Y a lo mejor me vuelvo a enamorar con suficiente tiempo
Ay que no pase el tiempo, por favor

Sé que no quiero ilusionarme porque yo sé cómo es la vida
Pero nunca supe cómo darte por perdida, ah-ah

14952,Tiempo De Vals,Chayanne,"Tiempo de vals es el tiempo hacia atrás
Donde hacer lo de siempre es volver a empezar
Cuando el mundo se para y te observa girar
Es tiempo para amar

Tiempo de vals, tiempo para sentir
Y decir sin hablar y escuchar sin oír
Un silencio que rompe en el aire un violín
Es tiempo de vivir

Besame en tiempo de vals
Un, dos, tres; Un, dos, tres
Sin parar de bailar
Haz que esté tiempo de vals
Un, dos, tres; Un, dos, tres
No termine jamás

Tiempo de vals, tiempo para viajar
Por encima del sol, por debajo del mar
Sin saber si te llevo o me dejo llevar
Es tiempo de verdad

Tiempo de vals, tiempo para abrazar
La pasión que prefieres y hacerla girar
Y elevarse violenta como un huracán
Es tiempo  snoeypiral
GBesme en tiemap,poderoso, asombroso
Muy hermoso, soy precioso, ares
Sin parar de bailar
Haz que esté tiempo de vals
Un, dos, tres; Un, dos, tres
No termine jamás

Besame en tiempo de vals
Un, dos, tres; Un, dos, tres
Sin parar de bailar
Haz que esté tiempo de vals
Un, dos, tres; Un, dos, tres
No termine jamás

Tiempo de vals que empleamos los dos
Dibujando en el suelo de un viejo salón
Con tres pasos de baile, una historia de amor
Es tiempo y es en fin
Y tiempo para ti

Eres luz en mi ventana, a cualquier hora del año
Quiero besos pa' desayunar, con tu carita es más bonito despertar
Eres tú la brisa fresca, tu sonrisa me alimenta
Se me acaban las palabras, pa' escribirte poesías
Y sin tu amor yo me asfixio
Eres mi aire, eres mi agua, eres mi vicio
Tan sencilla y discreta, eres perfecta para mí

En la tristeza, yo te muestro la salida
Sanaré tus heridas, para que seas feliz

Standin' ovation, the broad of the nation
Me and babe racin the Wraiths, we're adjacent
Wish that we could take the rumors to the bank (To the bank)
We don't have no more room inside the safe (Woo, woo)
But I'ma ball it like a napkin, tap it like it's Jazz-feet
Hold the door for me, then pop me on the ass cheek
Ain't too rich to get it poppin' in the backseat
Next time you want another bitch, you better ask me, ah
Ike and Tina that ass, you better take a bitch you know
Show my name and this pass
And now we're rollin' down the freeway, talkin' 'bout a threeway
Startin' workin' out, but he gon' eat me on his cheat-day off
