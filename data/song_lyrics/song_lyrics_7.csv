0,21020,Girl Next Door,Musiq Soulchild,"[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Verse 1: Musiq Soulchild]
Girl I'm so surprised to see
The young, fine woman that you grew up to be
Your body's banging like a 400-SE
Even your attitude flows pleasantly
I remember when you was just Tonya Hall
A girl that likes to play basketball
As far as I was concerned, you were one of my boys
I never cared about my sex or yours, but...

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Verse 2: Musiq Soulchild]
I'm happy to see that you're home from school
And I wanna let you know that I'm proud of you
Even when we was younger, I admired you
That's why I used to always pick fights with you
I remember when we used to call each other names
Mimic old tv shows and play those childish games
Like I was your Tarzan and you were my Jane
Can we do that nowadays?

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Hook: Ayana]
If I would've knew the boy next door would've been you
I would've been nice to you
Spent a little time with you
I would've dressed cuter too
If I would've knew the boy next door
Would've been you
I would've been on your team
When we played hide and seek
Instead of you chasing me

[Bridge: Ayana (& Musiq Soulchild)]
You're so fly now
(Girl stop playing)
I didn't know you were that guy now
(Naw I ain't)
Phat car, phat life
Impressed I am
Oh maybe we could jam like we used to baby

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

How many times have I called you
While you were working, just to say
Left messages on your answer machine
About 3 or 4 times a day

[Hook]
There aren't many more ways in words that I can say
So i'll just say numerically
From my heart to you - one-four-three

[Verse 2]
So many times I've bought roses
Just to see that smile on your face
I can't remember how many e-mails I sent you
Just to tell you 'bout my day

There aren't many more ways in words that I can say

Girl you know you are so special to me
And you deserve to be treated exclusively

I treat you like Valentines Day 365 a year
Make sure that everything you need will always be right here
Now I just refuse to be your typical ordinary run of the mill
Garden variety lover
(ooh oh oh)

[Verse 4]
I'll make sure everyday you live will be like Christmas Eve
I wanna make you feel fine just like a summer breeze
Cause I refuse to be your predictable average run of the mill
Garden variety love
(ohh ohh oh)

[Verse 5]
See sometimes words may get in the way
Of things that you really really meant to say
So I wanna take out this time to
Make sure that how I really feel gets through to you
Cause listen
There aren't many more ways and words that I can say
So I choose to tell you how I feel in a numerical way
Got so tired of trying to find the most complicated way
To say it to you so I simplified and broke it down
To one-four-three - and that means I love you

Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten

And yes, it gets emotional
Those feeling that come up between a boy and girl
And all those words you said you know you didn't mean
The ears that heard them now are feeling very sad

Understanding is the thing, the key
To open locks that you never believed to even see
And something there in your very heart
Knows that you'll both be there and you'll never part

We take two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten

Domestic bliss on a cloud named nine
Sweet sexiness, soft caress could be be yours and mine
A cloud named nine

5,21024,Talk To Her,India.Arie,"[Chorus]
When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would with your daughter
'Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

[Verse 1]
Now when you go to her, speak truthfully
Be honest as you can be, from your heart
You're in a situation, where you're losing patience
Take your time and look her in the eye
When you just can't find the words you want
And it's hard to reach a point
Where you both can understand
Don't just tell the truth, but tell the whole truth
It'll make a better man outta you

[Chorus]
When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would with your daughter
'Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

[Verse 2]
It doesn't matter if she's wearing
A mini skirt or a business suit
Whether she's 25 or 99
Treat her the way your mama taught you to
She could be the Queen of Sheba
She could be a school teacher
A home maker or a lawyer
I think it's good for your Karma
If...

When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would with your daughter
'Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

[Bridge]
Now let's keep it real
Nothing in this world could ever exist
Without it's opposite
There has to be a sun and moon
A man and a woman
And that's just the way it is
Humanity's lopsided
And everyone's fighting
How do we restore the peace?
Mother earth is hurtin'
'Cause everyone is searchin'
For the feminine energy
You got to talk to her...

[Chorus]
When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would with your daughter
'Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

[Post-Chorus]
When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Just like you fight for your sister
If you knew that somebody dissed her
How you gonna care for your daughter
Turn around and talk bad about her mama?
Same way you listen to your auntie
Never interrupt while she speaks
Make your words sweet like candy
As if you were talking to your granny yeah

If you're thinking about leaving (say so)
If you wonder where she's going (say so)
If you need to breathe with her (say so)
You just want to be with her (say so)
If you love her hair (say so)
If you wanted her (say so)
Tell me if you really wanted her (say so)
You wanna slap her down (say so)
Say so...

What am I talking about?
Got too much to say, got too much to shout
Should I write it in capital letters?
You can figure it out
Why make a noise if you're deaf to my words?
You think it's a ploy and I'm testin' your hurt
How can I show you the truth if your turn away when I'm bruised?

Someone cut the line, someone cut the line

You can't complain when you're shuttin' me out

Is it serious to say or serious to sing?
I notice that whenever the melody ring
You take a sentiment and pop it in the bin
And start jammin'

Your intelligence is oblivious to so much, so much, so
You close so tight that

Forward, backward, left or right?
And know how to continue on this path at all?
Why can't you see I'm in love with you?
Can you step out of your cubbyhole
And hold me tight? Speak your mind
As we roll on through life
It'll be alright if you're by my side
Let go and try
Let me in so I can sit by your side for the rest of our lives
Get that broken line and tie
Tie it up tight and mend it

Someone cut the line, someone cut the line

I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

But I, I need you to want me
I need you to miss me
I, I need yo' attention, yes

Oh I, I need someone to clap for me (Mm-hmm)
I need your direction

Somebody say come back
Come back, baby, come back
(I want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Baby)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Need me, ah)

[Verse 2]
So, out my mind I'm tusslin'
Back and forth 'tween here and hustlin'
I don't wanna time travel no mo'
I wanna be here, my thinkin'
Say, on this porch I'm rockin'
Back and forth like Lightnin' Hopkins
So if anybody speak to Scotty
Tell him, ""Beam me up!""

[Hook]
So can I get a window seat? (Hey)
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat? (Oh, oh)
Don't want nobody next to me (Hey)
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye
Oh, oh

And I need your direction

Somebody say come back (Hey)
Come back, baby, come back

I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Oh, oh
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye

[Outro]
They play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. They move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. They feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. They are us. This is what we have become. Afraid to respect the individual. A single person within a circumstance can move one to change. To love herself. To evolve

There it is right there, out far in the distance
I can see it so clear, it's what I've been missing
I'm like the rolling stone, it's coming down heavy
Just to get to your love babe, yea you better get ready

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Nothing's going to get in my way
Its what I'm yearning, the fires burning
I've wandered through harder days
Baby I need you! Baby I need you!

[Chorus]
You can't stand, you can't stand
Nothing's gonna stand in the way of my love
Try as hard as you can
Nothing's gonna stand in the way of my love
My love, my love
You can't stand, you can't stand
Nothing's gonna stand in the way of my love

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid I might lose my mind, and do something crazy
Pull the moon down out of the sky, until you love me baby
I'm like the raging sea, the scorch of a summer
Nothing like the devil, but I'm bound to take you under

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Nothing's going to get in my way
The wheels are turning, I'm still determined
It's only just a matter of days
You gonna want me, like I want you

You can't stand, you can't stand
Nothing's gonna stand in the way of my love
Try as hard as you can
Nothing's gonna stand in the way of my love
My love, my love

Nothing's gonna stand in the way of my love

My love, my love
You can't stand, you can't stand
Nothing's gonna stand in the way of my love

You can't stand, you can't stand
Nothing's gonna stand in the way of my love

14,21018,single,Musiq Soulchild,"Woke up this morning
Smelled the breakfast in the air
Hopped in the shower
Would have got dressed but I undressed my girl instead

We did some things
Got some food and now I'm on my way to work
Got into my car, started up
Drove off, now I'm on the road

That's when I pulled up to this gas station
And got into this conversation
With this girl I could tell she wanted me but, oh

If I met you when I was single
We probably could have been something more
'Cause you're beautiful but you should know
That I found my girl and I know I love her, so I gotta go

She cracked a smile
And she said she understood
And I sympathize
'Cause every man she had was never any good

It's so amazing
How much you could learn in just a bit of time
Like how I see me and her in my mind

That's why I need to pull out of this gas station
'Cause after this conversation with you, girl
I might just do something I don't wanna do 'cause

If I met you when I was single
We probably could have been something more
'Cause you're beautiful but you should know
That I found my girl and I know I love her, so I gotta go

And I know it's such a shame
You can't even entertain the things you feel
Don't feel bad 'cause I feel the same
It would just be wasted time
Trying to find if life's greener on the other side

If I met you when I was single
We probably could have been something more
'Cause you're beautiful but you should know
That I found my girl and I know I love her
So I just gotta go go

Said I gotta go
It's nice to meet you but I
But I just gotta go

If I met you when I was single
We probably could have been something more
'Cause you're beautiful, yeah but you should know
That I found my girl and I know I love her so, I gotta go

One shot to your heart without breaking your skin
No one has the power to hurt you like your kin
Kept it inside, didn't tell no one else
Didn't even wanna admit it to yourself
And now your chest burns and your back aches
From 15 years of holding the pain
And now you only have yourself to blame
If you continue to live this way

[Hook]
Get it together
You wanna heal your body
Get it together
You have to heal your heart
Whatsoever you sow you will reap
Get it together

You can fly, fly

[Verse 2: India.Arie]
Dark future ahead of me
That's what they said
I'd be starving if I ate all the lies they fed
'Cause I've been redeemed from your anguish and pain
A miracle child I'm floating on a cloud
'Cause the words that come from your mouth
You're the first to hear
Speak words of beauty and you will be there
No matter what anybody says
What matters the most is what you think of yourself

[Hook]
Get it together
You wanna heal your body
Get it together
You have to heal your heart
Whatsoever you sow you will reap
Get it together

[Bridge]
The choice is yours
No matter what it is
To choose life is to choose to forgive
You don't have to try
To hurt him and break his pride
To shake that weight off
And you will be ready to fly

[Verse 3: India.Arie]
One shot to your heart without breaking your skin
No one has the power to hurt you like your friends
Thought it will never change but as time moved on
That ugly duckling grew up to be a swan
And now your chest burns and your back aches
Because now the years are showing up on your face
But you'll never be happy
And you'll never be whole
Until you see the beauty in growing old

[Hook]
Get it together
You wanna heal your body
Get it together
You have to heal your heart
Whatsoever you sow you will reap
Get it together

[Outro]
You can fly, fly, fly, fly
You can live or you can die
You know that life is a choice you make
You can give or you can take
You can fly, fly, fly, fly
You can fly, fly, fly, fly
You can fly, fly, fly, fly
You can fly, fly, fly, fly

16,21012,Season's Trees,Danger Mouse,"Every girl gets her dreams
Cast into reality
Never seemed to bother me
Only just recently

'Cause you seem to believe
That we'll never be free
Always gonna be needing

Can't we be
Like the season's trees
Changeably
Just not so easily

All in all we're the same
Jumping through hoops of flames
Sounds fun, what a dangerous game
Pretty picture trapped in frame

But you seem to behave
Like we'll always be slaves
Never running away

Can't we be
Like the season's trees
Changeably
Just not too easily

'Cause you seem to believe
That we'll never be free
Always gonna be needing

Can't we be

I can see the light of day
I've got love as my connection
There's an angel showing me the way

Been reaching for love all my life
I couldn't find it always one step behind it
Now I know it was mine all the time finally I am

Headed in the right direction
I can see the light of day
I've got love as my protection
There's no need for me to be afraid

I spend so much time with my head in the clouds
Now that I've got my feet on the ground
I found that I am

Headed in the right direction
I can see the light of day
I've got faith and intuition telling me that I will be okay

Down the path that I walked there was eyes
Somebody told me that I look like I'm glowing
They just dried all the tears from my eyes now I can see that

Headed in the right direction
I can see the light of day
Now I've found my pearl of wisdom
There's no need for me to be afraid

Headed in the right direction
There's an angel showing me the way
I have found my inspiration
Headed in the right direction

18,21025,Slow Down,India.Arie,"So far from where I started out
So far from where I wanna be
Listening for answers in the wind
But can't find a rock to plant my feet
Looking for love in all the wrong places
Down on my knees and now I'm praying for patience
I know there's gotta be a better way
In the back of my mind I hear my momma say

Slow down, Baby you're going too fast
You got you hands in the air
With you feet on the gas
You're 'bout to wreck your future
Running from your past
You need to slow down baby

Thinking the faster that I go
The faster (that) I will reach my goal
The race is not given to the swift
But to him who endureth
I thought that all my obstacles were behind me
Walking around like I'm made out of diamond
I tripped and fell and it reminded me
Move over and let the angels guide me

Slow down, Baby you're going too fast
You got you hands in the air
With you feet on the gas
You're 'bout to wreck your future
Running from your past
You need to slow down baby

Sometimes you gotta be still
Before you can get ahead
Be still
Ask the universe for help
Be real
You can't do it all by yourself
Ah, no no
Sometimes, sometimes you gotta be still
Take some time to rejuvenate
Be still
Take some time to clear your space
Be real
Chaos isn't good for your health
Ah, no no, ahhh
Cuz I'm breaking things and losing things
I lost myself at the end of the day
Now, I don't wanna live this way, no
In the back of my mind I hear my mama say

Slow down, Baby you're going too fast
You got you hands in the air
With you feet on the gas
You're 'bout to wreck your future
Running from your past
You need to slow down before
You go down baby
(Slow down baby)
Slow down (baby)
You're going too fast
Slow down (baby)
Feet on the gas
Slow down (baby)
Run from your past
Slow down baby (4x)

[Verse 1]
Been around the whole world
Still ain't seen nothing like my neighborhood
Out of all of the fancy satin and silk
My white cotton feels so good
Searched high and low for a place
Where I can lay my burdens down
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like the peace that I have found

[Chorus]
In the little things (in the little things)
And the joy they bring
In the little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring

[Verse 2]
Simple as a phone call just to make it known
That you're gonna be a little late
Pure as a kiss on the cheek and a word
That everything will be okay
Call in the morning from my little sister
Singing to me happy birthday
When you quest for fortune and fame
Don't forget about the simple things

In the little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring
It's the little things (its the little things)
And the joy

Give me some cute shoes
Give me some peace of mind
Give me some sunshine
Give me some blue skies

Running round in circles
Lost my focus
Lost sight of my goals
I do this for the love of music
Not for the glitter and gold
Got everything that I prayed for
Even a little more
When I asked to learn humility
This is what I was told

It's little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring
In the little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring

Give me some good news, give me some cute shoes

Pour me some sweet tea, spoonful of honey
I don't need no Hollywood

21,21016,Fool's Gold,Jill Scott,"[Verse 1]
Oh, silly me my dear for thinking that you'd stay
Gave you my heart and then you ran away
Either I'm stupid, I'm foolish or you're playing me
But it seems we were never really meant to be
(So I thought I would try something new)
I wanted to find out if I could live happy without you
And it turned out I wasn't living at all
But I would have never known if you had just played along

I was living the dream, believing things that just ain't true
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing Fools Gold
I was chasing Fools Gold
I was chasing Fools Gold

Somewhere deep down inside I knew you wasn't right
But breaking your spell was a plan I never devised
I would have been here forever living for you
But I would have been living forever as your fool

Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing Fools Gold

I took the wooden nickel
I was blinded to my core
And I went into the wrong door

Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you (I can't believe)

And now they bring you back into my life again
And so I put on a face just like your friends
But I think you know, oh yes, you know what's going on
'Cause the feelings in me, oh yes, in me are burning strong

Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone

And it would be so hard for me not to cross the line
The words of love lay on my lips just like a curse
And I knew, oh yes, I knew they'd only make it worse
And now you have the nerve to play along
Just like the maestro beats in your song
You get your kicks, you get your kicks from playing me
And the less you give, the more I want, so foolishly

But I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
I'm standing upright on my own, own
No, I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone

Loving you is like a battle we both end up scarred

Forces you to scream my name, then pretend, that you can't stay

I keep letting you back in, how can I explain myself?

Let me tell you why I love him

[Chorus]
'Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie

[Verse 1]
I remember the very first day that I saw him
I found myself immediately intrigued by him
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband maybe he was my wife
And even things I don't like about him are fine with me
'Cause it's not hard for me to understand him cause he's so much like me
And it's truly my pleasure to share his company
And I know that it's God's gift to breathe
The air he breathes

[Chorus]
'Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie (no)

[Verse 2]
How can the same man that makes me so mad
Do you know what he did
Turn right around and kiss me so soft
Girl, do you know what he did
If he ever left me I wouldn't even be sad no
'Cause there's a blessing in every lesson
And I'm glad that I knew him at all

[Chorus]
'Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie

[Bridge, Breakdown, & Ending]
I love the way he speaks
I love the way he thinks
I love the way that he treats his mama
I love that gap in between his teeth
I love him in every way that a woman can love a man
From personal to universal but most of all
It's unconditional

You know what I'm talking about
That's the way I feel
And I always will

There ain't no substitute for the truth
Either it is or isn't
('Cause he is the truth)
You see the truth it needs no proof
Either it is or it isn't
('Cause he is the truth)
Now you know the truth by the way it feels
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly
Because he is, yes, he is
I wonder does he know

Let me get this out the way
So there ain't no complications
Later on for us
But I know things don't stay the same
People grow and seasons change
But when it comes to love
Don't you feel like
You ever gotta worry about my
Feelings changing for you over time
Cause when I say I care, girl, I mean it

So when the world
And the odds are against us
You won't have to question
The answer is yes
When two or three years from now
You start having some doubts
'Bout if this love will last
The answer is yes
I'll still think you're beautiful
Cause I'm more attracted to what's inside of you
You don't have to guess
The answer is yes

[Bridge 1]
Cause I love you (I love you)
All I care about is your happiness
So the answer is yes

People just don't stick around (no)
Build you up and let you down

I understand that you've been burned (before)
Honesty is what you deserve (so much more)

When you need me most (no)
The answer is no
I'm dedicated to what we have
But will I be here
The way that I promised?
I'll say with no fear

The answer is yes
When two or three years from now

27,21022,Silky Soul,Maze,"There was a man I knew
Who was smooth as smooth can be
His music his smile
And his sweet sweet melody
Do you recall that mentor
And the voice with the velvet touch

That special one that very special one
I do remember
How much he's done
How much the man has done
I can still hear his sweet song

As he danced across the floor

Made you want to see much more
And most of all was inside
Was a heart as pure as gold

Lives and never can grow old

Harder than marble stone

Please don't think that I owe ya
Look at what you put me through
If I had a chance to plan what I would say to you
I'd turn around so beautiful
And look you in the eye just to prove I don't love you
Or need you
Clouding my mind
In darkness I'll find
Nothing at all, at all, at all

[Chorus]
Baby, can't you hear this sound?
All the arguments are screaming out
This ain't love that we've found at all, at all
Baby, won't you realize?
You know that I'm not your prize
Why we wasting our time?
To me you're nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Please don't think I'll forget ya
Nothing in the world could move
All the scars that you gave me
Memories I just can't lose
If I had a chance to show ya
How it feels, you know I would do
My best to test
How heartless you really are
To me you're nothing at all
To me you're nothing at all, at all, at all

Baby, can't you hear this sound?
All the arguments are screaming out
This ain't love that we've found at all, at all

To me you're nothing at all
To me you're nothing at all

[Bridge]
Why don't you, why don't you leave me?
Go, get out
Turn around
'Cause I got a mouth
That'll knock you down
And when it's over
You won't know what hit you
'Cause you'll be looking up at me from the ground
(Ooh, ooh)
Won't you take the time to lay it all out
On the table and figure this out?
Reality is staring us right in the face
I'm in a place I can't seem to turn around
Something's gotta give, we can start to live
Without having to shout so loud
Relationship's a trip with a lack of light
It's the time we need to get out
Get out (Ooh, ooh)
Get out (Ooh, ooh)
We need to get out

[Chorus]
Baby, can't you hear this sound?
All the arguments are screaming out
This ain't love
This ain't love
This ain't love
Baby, won't you realize?
You know that I'm not your prize
Now why we wasting our time?
To me you're nothing
To me you're nothing
You're nothing at all
And this ain't love
This ain't love that we've found

See, I know love don't look like this
(No, love don't look like this; no, love; no, love; no, love)
And I know love don't taste nothing like this
Nothing at all

'Cause I've had enough
I've had enough of your lack of love
(No, love don't look like this; no, love; no, love; no, love)
I've had enough of this bad taste
Had enough of you wasting my time
(No, love don't look like this; no, love; no, love; no, love)

30,21034,Everything Is Everything,Ms. Lauryn Hill,"Everything (Everything)
Is Everything(Is Everything)
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
(2x)

I wrote these words for everyone
Who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception
Instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? We're so confused
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)
Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything

I philosophy
Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen
From the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper / actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty
L. Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Now hear this mixture
Where hip hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture

Now everything, is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

Sometimes it seems
We'll touch that dream
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top, won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves then we can't fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication

Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)
Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything

Everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

I tried, and I tried, and I tried
To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)
I cried, and I cried, and I cried
But I couldn't make it right

I'm just stylefreein', freestylin' which I seldom do
This is what I'm tellin' you, to the bed I'm nailin' you (I'm ready to go right now)
Like I've been in jail for two, years and then they let me loose (I'm ready to go right now)

[Chorus: John Legend & Andre 3000]
Give me the green light (You got you one, Legend)
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now (Sometimes you gotta step from behind that piano)
I'm ready to go right now (And let 'em know what's going on)
Give me the green light (Even Stevie Wonder got down sometimes, haha)
I'm ready to go right now (I'm ready to go, my mandate can't wait)
I'm ready to go right now (Participate)

[Outro: John Legend]
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

41,21046,Save Room,John Legend,"[Verse 1]
Say that you'll stay a little
Dont say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
Just a little bit of love
Is worth a moment of your time
Knockin' on your door just a little
It's so cold outside tonight
Let's get a fire burning
Oh, I know I'll keep it burning bright
If you stay, won't you save, save

[Hook]
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me? (oh)

[Verse 2]
This just might hurt a little
But, love hurts sometimes when you do it right
Dont be afraid of a little bit of pain
Pleasure is on the other side
Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
You will see, I can be all you need
If you stay, won't you save, save

[Hook]
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me? (oh)

Oh, come on
Make time to live a little
Don't let this moment slip by tonight
You'll never know what you're missing 'til you try
I'll keep you satisfied if you stay
Won't you save, save

[Hook] x2
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me (oh)

Save a little for me?)

42,21049,Each Day Gets Better,John Legend,"[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

[Verse 1]
I'll write a song
I thought about it for far too long
But I've never had someone to sing about
Until I met her and each day gets better
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody else understands me like she
Now that I know what true love means
I Just hope she stays with me

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

[Verse 2]
She wants to breathe
She wants to be where the grass is green
She wants to know how love's supposed to be
She wants it better
I want to let her know
She belongs right here with me
She's heard it all but I'll make her see
I'll make her fall
Make her believe
I promised her that I'll never leave

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

[Bridge]
I just had to write a song about her
Tell her I don't wanna live without her
Tell her I would build my world around her
Deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter
I'll never leave her alone

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

Each day gets better
I just can't let her go

Each day kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

Yeah
Yeah, mmm
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
See, the road to hell is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention
How they helped you out? You're such a hopeless victim
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional

[Verse 2]
All their talk is seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation
An opportunity to further situation
Why they're so important is without explanation
Please don't patronize me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
We give rise to ego by being insecure
The advice that we go desperately searching for
The subconscious effort to support our paramour
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional

[Verse 4]
Stuck in a system that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage by what everybody does
Counting all the money that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance in the name of love
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional

Oh, one-dimensional
Mr. Intentional
Oh oh, don't you do me any favors
Oh oh, oh oh

[Bridge]
Wake up, you've been sleeping
Take up your bed and walk
Stop blaming other people
Oh, it's nobody else's fault
Accept the truth about you
You know that life goes on without you
And your expensive misinventions
Disguising your intentions
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional

[Verse 5]
See, I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional
The only help I need to live is unprofessional
The only wealth I have to give is not material
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, I don't need your sympathy, Mr. Intentional
Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional

[Outro]
So one-dimensional
Mr. Promotional
Mr. Emotional

Money rains from the sky above
But keep the change cause I've got enough
A little time and some tenderness
You'll never buy my love
No other thing that's as precious to
No other! There's no other!
Than a heart that's real and a heart that's true
Something that you've got to know this girl

These presents don't really come for free
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me
Just take my hand and hold me tight
You'll never buy my love
You buy me this and you buy me that
To win over! Win me over!
You got me wrong and that's a fact
Something that you've got to notice

[Bridge]
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song?
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song?
It's a shame but I've got to go

Grandma braggin' bout the blanket she made
For the new baby on her way
Even though the daddy ain't really ready
This child is coming anyway yeah

Neicy made her famous potato salad
Somehow it turns out green
Maybe it's all the scallions
Could be the celery
But oh Uncle Jerome loves it (Hmm)
Hey baby baby, here comes my favorite, my favorite cousin
He says he doing fine, taking it one step a day
But in my heart I know it ain't that way

I'm gettin' riled up, I want them to go
But somebody turn Frankie Beverly on the stereo
Cousin Ruby starts rockin', shakin' her good hip and bottom
So we all fall into place smiling and laughing

Here you go, jacket down
Timbs off
Remote control
And there you go
Off into outerspace
Distant from me
Where do you go?
Your eyes are closed
I'd like to know

I stop, sit next to you because you seem so blue
And pray nothing's broke
Baby, I don't want to see us burn down
And go up in smoke

Talk to me, break it down, spell it out, spell it out for me

Begins the riff
You take off and there I sit
Alone feeling cold
I become antagonist, loud, and wrong
Words are thrown
I bitch, you moan
So I try another tactic, ohh

[Verse 3]
Close your eyes
Relax your mind
Cool down
Just recline
We've got the time
To let it go
Just unwind
I'll be cool baby
I'll be quiet
If you'd like
I'll put on your favorite song
Sounds nice
Thug passion on ice?
Or a glass of Merlot?
I'll roll it up
If you want
I won't front
I just need to know
What you know

Talk to me, break it down, spell it out for me, baby
Talk to me, break it down, spell it out for me

Oh, baby, I'm getting so frustrated
Aggravated
And so it seems that you're hiding something from me
And that ain't the way, my sweet
I'm loving you
But I get confused
And what makes me fear
When your personality is unclear
I make things up in my mind
You're right next to me
But sometimes I feel like you're off away
And you just don't have a thing to say
But I'm here for you
So tell me what you, tell me what you're going through

52,21077,Love Rain,Mos Def,"Chorus:
Love rain down on me
On me
Down on me
Love rain down on me
On me
Down on me
Love rain down on me
On me
Down on me
Love rain down on me
On me
Down one me
Met him on a Thursday
Sunny afternoon
Cumulous clouds, 84 degrees
He was brown
Said he wanted to talk about my mission, listen to my past lives
Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
Talked about Moses and Mumia, reparations, blue colors, memories of shell-topped Adidas
He was fresh like summer peaches;
Sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy
We were nice and warm, no jacket, no umbrella, just warm
At night, we would watch the stars
And he would physically give me each and every one
I felt like cayenne pepper, red, hot spicy
I felt dizzy and so near heaven
Miles between my thighs
Better than love, we made delicious
He me had, and had me he
He had me tongue tied;
I could hear his rhythm in my thoughts
I was his sharp, his horn section
His boom and his bip
And he was my love
Chorus x1
The rain was falling and slowly and sweetly and stinging my eyes
And I could see that he became my voodoo priest
And I was his faithful concubine
Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made, love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And we became new
Now me now clairvoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
The rain was falling
And I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off it's axis
Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
The...rain...was..falling...and...I...could not...see..that...I..was...to...be
Loud...
And so fertile
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds of 84 degree melody
Chorus x1
Mos Def:
I stretched my arms towards the sky like blades of tall grass
The sun beat between my shoulders like carnival drums
I sat still in hopes that it would help my wings to grow
So that I could be really fly
And then she arrived
Like day break inside a rainway tunnel
Like the new moon, like a diamond in the mines, like high noon to a drunkard, sudden
She made my heart beat in a now/now time signature
Her skinny canvas for ultraviolet brushstrokes;
She was the sun's painting
She was a deep cognac color;
Her eyes sparkled like lights along the new city
She lips pursed as if her breath was too sweet and full for her mouth to hold
I said, ""you are the beautiful, distress of mathematics.""
I said, ""For you, I would peel open the clouds like new fruit;
Give you lightning and thunder as a dowry
I would make the sky she'd all of it's stars like rain
And I would make the heavens your cape
And they would be pleased to cover you
They would be pleased to cover you
May I cover you?""

Hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Woo
Woo

[Verse 1]
Hello (Hello)
It's been a while since I've seen your smile (Smile)
I've had my eyes wide open for the longest time
Hopefully I'd see you on TV or a motion movie
The strangest thing (Strangest thing)
Happened to me just the other day
I heard a voice and I called out your name
As a speeding cab pulled off from me, from me

[Chorus]
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when I'll see you again
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting

[Verse 2]
The chances are (Chances are)
You picked up, packed up, didn't go real far
Maybe you're resting on the other side of town
Hopefully waiting to be found, be found
The strangest thing (Strangest thing)
Happened to me just the other day
I saw your picture and I called out your name
As a speeding cab pulled off from me, from me

[Chorus]
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when I'll see you again
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room where I will be waiting
(Waiting for you)
Been a while (Been a while) since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when I'll see you again
Hopefully soon (Soon) in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting for you

[Bridge]
For you, I would swim 'cross the ocean
Fly 'cross the widest sea for you
For you, there ain't nothing in the world
That I won't give to make you happy
I gave up my nightlife to be by your side
Only if it will bring you home to me

[Chorus]
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when (I don't know when, baby)
I'll see you again (I don't know)
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting
(I will be waiting, baby; I will be waiting)
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when
(It's been a long, long, long, long time)
I'll see you again
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting
(I will be waiting, I will be waiting)
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when I'll see you again (I don't know)
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting
(I will be waiting, oh, no, no)

[Outro]
(Been a while) Said it's been
Such a long, long, long, long time, yeah
Oh, oh, Magnolia's room is getting kinda cold
And you've been gone too long, too long, yeah
And I'm going crazy, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, hey

54,21052,Run and Hide,Algebra Blessett,"[Verse 1]
Patiently waiting
On the right guy
He says I'm precious
But I think he's lyin'
Just to get my attention
Make me fall not to mention
He got crazy intentions
I couldn't trust him
So I didn't want him

[Pre-Chorus]
Surely I may not
Know exactly what I want
But surely I know
Exactly what I don't

[Chorus]
Still I haven't found what I've
Been looking for but I
Can't do this no more
I'm-a just run and hide
Go far away to hide
True love I'll never find
Gonna pack my heart and hide
I'm-a just run

[Verse 2]
I done, done it all before
Wined and dined, even ignored
Played the role of a bad girl
And snuck some boys out the back door
Just so someone would love me
I got smart and start to thinking
I wasn't smilin' or feelin' free
This ain't love
And I ain't happy

Surely I may not
Know exactly what I want
But surely I know
Exactly what I don't

That's what I get for being so picky
Thought I found Mr. Right but he tricked me
Smiled in my face somehow I fell hard
I'm hurt again and right back at start
When a different pace and lost a lot of time
I ran the wrong race and lost all my mind
I gotta get back, I can't hide that
I gotta find it, I guess I gotta pack
Toothbrush, guitar and a big comb
Who's gonna look for me when I'm gone

Still I haven't found what I've
Been looking for but I
Can't do this no more
I'm-a just run and hide
Go far away to hide
True love I'll never find
Gonna pack my heart and hide
I'm-a just run

I don't know why
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn]
Living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
I say we load it, cock it, aim and shoot, oh
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot, oh

[Verse 1: Raheem DeVaughn]
Some will die over oil, kill over land
Charge you for taxes and blame Uncle Sam
Read you your rights, and charge you for nothing
Now who’s really gangsta and tell me who’s frontin’?
Murder your sons, ravage your daughters
Here overseas and across the waters
Tanks and missiles, bombs and grenades
Inject your land with guns and AIDS
You better pray to the Most High or whoever you praise
The politicians can’t help you, they just puppets and slaves
Tryna get paid and you are too
What you gon' do when the gun is pointed at you?
Like bank robbers, we're living

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn]
Living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot, hey
I said we living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
I said we load it, cock it, aim and shoot, oh
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot, oh

[Verse 2: Raheem DeVaughn]
Get you a paper, turn on the news
Ride through the hood, I witnessed the blues
How can you ignore it? It’s easy to spot it
The trap house, a liquor store and your city’s got it
And my city’s got it, and they city’s got it
This world is chaotic and love is symbolic
So life don’t get cherished, so our babies perish
And your babies perish, now tell me who’s careless?
Now who should I pray to? What should I pray for?
You can’t pay the preacher for your redemption
I know where we’re headed, I already read it
The good book done said it (Like cowboys and Indians, we just)

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn & Ludacris]
Living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot, hey
I said we living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
I said we load it, cock it, aim and shoot, oh
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot, oh (Luda)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
They say tomorrow's not promised today but today I promise
If we don’t make our own way, somebody’ll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese, so Lord help me please
'Cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I’m bulletproof, cocking the Glock and aim and shoot
My future’s ever clear, a 180-proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride
And drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreaming of better days, dreaming of better pay
But we got our work cut out for us so we better pray
Pray to uphold the week, not for eternal sleep
But if I die, I pray the Lord my soul to keep

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn]
Living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot, hey
I said we living like we bulletproof
We bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
I said we load it, cock it, aim and shoot, oh
We load it, cock it, aim and shoot, oh

[Outro: Raheem DeVaughn]
Living like we bulletproof
I don't know why
I don't know why (I don't know why)
We living like we bulletproof, hey, hey
I don't know why, no, hey
I don't know why, ooh
I don't know why, oh
We living like we bulletproof, woo
Ooh, Heavenly Father
I don't know why, hey

57,21095,Ain't Nothing Changed,Loyle Carner,"[Verse 1]
Uh, check, uh, I kind of miss my student loan
Uh, I miss sitting in the student home
Sharing stories now I simmer sippin', sorta Rome
Walking like I've been talking the talk but can't afford a phone
Trust, I'm all alone panicking to play it safe
This talk of paper chase is forcing me to stay awake
Living this layer cake where others will say you’re straight
Say they got my back and that they're praying
I'ma pave the way
Like it's the great escape, brothers doing better than me
I'm in a hurry, worry, what if they forget about me?
I'm just another number nothing when the cheque will bounce
See now we're moving for money
But there's nothing but debt around me
So when the rest have found me buggin' in the brain
And I'm somewhere between the struggle and the strain
They ask why every fucking song the fucking same
And I tell them it's 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying ain't nothing changed

[Chorus]
Check, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
Nah, 'cause ain't nothing changed
I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Uh, uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Brother, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
Nah, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed

[Verse 2]
'Cause this is for the men of the house who were far too young
See your friends are growing up but feel you can't do none
You're raising funds for your mother and your can’t do sons
Up in the rubble raising trouble, what you can’t do is run
And trust I feel it, I feel it, but can't conceal it, see
This inner-city responsibility's killing me
I start to shiver when I think of all the shit I need
And see all my brothers burning paper on that sticky greed
Picking the thickest leaves stuck in a mitt
Taking a shit, I should have quit but couldn't fucking resist
And now they sit with a lager, little luck, and a wish
But trust they still blow their mother a kiss
They're living up in the bits
And slip, stagger through the puddles and the pain
Somewhere beneath the rubbles in the rain, uh
They ask why every fucking song the fucking same
And I tell them it's 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying ain't nothing changed

[Chorus]
Check, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
Nah, 'cause ain't nothing changed
I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Uh, uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Brother, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
Nah, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed

Saw you again at the parlor
Crossing the walk with your lady
I caught your eye from afar
I noticed she wore a ring
I found a smile against my will
Wish it was genuine
I put away my desire
No more in love with you still
Look, I am moving on

[Chorus:]
Loved you
Lost you
Though I'd give you
All the best of me

We departed
Brokenhearted

I need to be free
What we had was oh so lovely
I'll swallow my pain
It's my time to find the best of me

[Verse 2:]
Can't be the time to be beggin'
Can't be the time to plead
My momma made me much wiser
What's mine will be just for me

I'm praying hard just to focus
I'm trying hard to sleep
Promise I'm glad you're happy
When it's my time it will be
Look I'm moving on

Oh my why
Have I been just so foolish all this time
Not realizing the beauty
That your eyes once saw in mine
I guess it's time to find the best of me

‘Cause I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, cope with the standards
Wishing for some change while I’m trying to find the answers
But oh I, oh I …
I think it’s ‘bout that time, to fight till that throne’s mine
Now please stop pretending everything is alright
‘Cause you can run but you can’t hide
From the, issues and problems in the real world
(So get ‘em, tell ‘em)
Tell ‘em that this jam is my only way of living in a free world
(Is my only way of living in a free world)

[Chorus: Willem Ardui]
Stop pretending nothing’s going on in this world
Fight for equality
Hands up don’t shoot

[Verse 2: Willem Ardui]
Let’s walk in this parade together
Realize it ain’t over and fight for a better world
You heard it, stop hiding the truth
Let’s make an end to what we started
Look these broken hearted people in the eyes, fight
Stop lying to yourself, institutional lies
Pimp this caterpillar
Still we believe what they tell us
Let us just walk in this parade together, -gether
Gather ‘round and let me tell ya
It’s not only war in the streets
Also the war within our souls that can change the weather
Don’t you get that
Or do you think you’re the exception
They should except it?
Fuck that
This shit ain’t over, nah
This shit ain't over

[Chorus: Willem Ardui]
Stop pretending nothing’s going on in this world
Fight for equality
Hands up don’t shoot

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

[Verse 1]
Sister girl, I know you don't understand
But you're gonna have to understand he's my man now
What you had is gone, our thing is sweet
Our thing is stronger than any lie you can tell on me
He knows my heart and that's the part
Your roots are dug up, so you might as well give up
I see your intentions, you can't handle the truth
He let you go a long time ago, now it's time to turn him loose

[Chorus]
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in my way)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(My feelings, you're)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin')

Sugar honey girl, fly, fly away
I've been a lady up to now, don't know how much more I can take
Queens shouldn't swing, if you know what I mean
But I'm 'bout to take my earrings off, get me some Vaseline

(I'm 'bout to go off in your face, girl, you better chill)
Chill and I mean it
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
You better relax yourself

He's my man, girl, nobody else's
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
You better back down

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in my way, you better back down)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in my the way)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

[Post-Chorus]
Everything was beautiful between me and him (You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')
And here come you and your big mouth talkin' about me
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
Telling him that you've seen me up twenty-forth street (You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
With them other cats, but you know that's a lie
You keep lyin' to my man, girlfriend (You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
I'm gon' take you out in the middle of the street and whoop your tail (You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')

For it's worth $5.99 or somethin' like that

66,21054,Tug of War,Algebra Blessett,"Sometimes I see you
You're so happy when I'm around
Then you change your mind and look at me
Like I let you down
You used to return phone calls
Visited me often
Something's changed, it's not the same
I just don't know

Now I don't understand you
Why you do the things you do
I never know
Been through this a time or two
Don't wanna feel like this no more

If I ask a question
You ask the same question
Why don't you answer
Instead of all this back and forth
Here we go again
Both of us pullin'
In different directions
In a game of tug of war
Why you keep fightin'
So hard to be right when
It doesn't matter
Tell me what we fightin' for
You 'bout to lose me
And I'm goin' be lonely so why do we both keep
Pullin' in this tug of war

Holdin' on to you
Is like I'm gambling my heart
If I let go
I will fall
Hard
I'll hurt myself, ooh
Never forget who
Let go of me
And never said I'm sorry, boo

Now I don't understand you
Why you do the things you do
I never know
Been through this a time or two
Don't wanna feel like this no more

If I ask a question
You ask the same question
Why don't you answer
Instead of all this back and forth
Here we go again
Both of us pullin'
In different directions
In a game of tug of war
Why you keep fightin'
So hard to be right when
It doesn't matter
Tell me what we fightin' for
You 'bout to lose me
And I'm gone be lonely so why do we both keep
Pullin' in this tug of war

Let's hold on or move on together
Do what it takes to make it better
If you keep one end I will give in
Or we let go then we both win

If I ask a question
You ask the same question
Why don't you answer
Instead of all this back and forth
Here we go again
Both of us pullin'
In different directions
In a game of tug of war
Why you keep fightin'
So hard to be right when
It doesn't matter
Tell me what we fightin' for
You 'bout to lose me
And I'm gone be lonely so why do we both keep
Pullin' in this tug of war

67,21099,Call It Love,Summers Sons,"[Turt}
Straight rhymes from the heart
Take time with the art
Vibe with my brother on the beats
My cousin on the keys, bass line and guitar

Don't pursue the image
I'd be moving too specific if I knew my limit
Monsoon till I cruise the blue pacific
It's soothing all my blues and all that's bruised my spirit
Find a loop and flip it
Search for words with truth to fill it
My views infinite
Observe the earth and movement in it
Rooted in it use my lyrics as a route to feel it
Soon admit it that we're smoother with it
Usually kick it with the crew when the moon is vivid
The room is filling with the fumes and rhythms
We're producing what the mood is fitting
Resume position here consuming what the bloom is bringing
Get a zoot and bill it
Resting in the booth I spit it
Letting loose within it
Nothing to prove I do this music for the feeling
It's a given that I'm giving that in my rap
Bring it back Tapp I need you to sing it

[C.Tappin]
Following the darkness of the unknown
Find the answer lying with the sun's glow
The sons of the Summers at hand so I know
The path to the motherland will be shown

[Turt]
Deep breath
I get stuck in a verse
With each penned I put my love in the words
See sense
Nothing's what the troubles are worth
Nothing's what the troubles are worth
I know Karma I know God
I know Allah
I know what?
I know the heart that those got
But don't believe in nothing tall above
I call it love and it's in all of us
A little's enough
It's all love
You're cool with us
It's all love

[C.Tappin]
It's all love
It's all love
It's all love
It's all love

Breathing weed in in the evening need a feeling deeper than the dreaming we believe in

71,21090,Ordinary,Wayne Brady,"All of our friends keep saying we should be more social
'Cause we keep to ourselves most of the time
They just don't understand what we've got going on
'Cause a love like this is so hard to find

Don't wanna live by no one else's designs
Though every day ain't glamorous, to me it's just fine
Unperfect the way that we are

Nothing ordinary 'bout the way I feel
Nothing un-extraordinary this is real
Don't need to reach for the stars
Happy here on earth in our beautiful ordinary life
I love my beautiful ordinary life with you

Why don't we spend the day, doing a lot of nothing?
'Cause anything's alright long as I'm with you, baby
We don't need special plans, don't need no reservations
'Cause my favorite place is right here with you

Don't wanna live my life any other way
'Cause baby, it's the simple things that can't be replaced
Unperfect the way that we are

Nothing ordinary 'bout the way I feel
Nothing un-extraordinary this is real
Don't need to reach for the stars
Happy here on earth in our beautiful ordinary life
I love my beautiful ordinary life with you

Like watching you sleep
The way that your paint your toes
The crazy way we, count to three before
We hang up the phone
See the life that I live, is so much better
Girl, when you're here with me
Nothing, nothing

Nothing ordinary 'bout the way I feel

Happy here on earth in our beautiful ordinary life

""I'm sorry for what I did, it was wrong what I did""
But we all make mistakes and I hope it's not to late, but...

My pride won't let me call you and apologize
It's selfish to say, but my pride won't let me come to you

It was foolish to think that you'd put up with me
I want you to want me back, but I'll never tell you that because...

First they tell you that they love you
Then they ask where you coming from
Like you the only one feeling how you feeling
Then you lie just to make it sound appealing
To him and her and even the family
That you keep close, just to blow the steam like Stanley
You the one that have to plunge in the back
Praying people in the front don't figure where you at
I get that, used to pray for the feeling, I don't miss that
I was stuck for a while, I'll admit it
The same damn thing, that you feeling man I get it but
I'm past that now, I sip this crown I don't mix no sprite
Only sip brown when I'm cooling with my niggas
So bitch go figure, its that kind of night, aight?

I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I fuck you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
Fuck you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help

[Verse 2]
Maybe if I had some diamond rings and nicer things
And wider cream, and smaller dreams, the simple things
That would have brought money more quickly
Maybe then you'd get the picture
But even then still snapping for my niggas
Swear I'm always on the phone tryna make sense of figures
Cause the nigga that got it ain't never been the one to spend it
You get it? Neither do I
The thought suicide for the money
We just call it being hungry nowadays
Every nigga getting paid, just a couple getting laid
If the chips fall right and the dick alright
Can I stay all night?
I can lie pretty well
Cause you posting all of my songs
Knowing pussy gonna sell

I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I love you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help
I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I love you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help

As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders, but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filming this walking project building
Now there's hoes selling holes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest, I'm sitting in my room
As I'm looking out the face, something to write about
I still got some damage from fighting the White House

We need a few more half-naked women up in the pool
And hold this MAC-10 that's all covered in jewels
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22s?
And where's the champagne? We need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain, slow-motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tip-toe 'round, creeping
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see, had the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me
I was

[Jill Scott]
8 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gonna get through? (I, don't, know)
Can't go left (uh-uh) can't go right (uh-uh)
Don't know, how we made it through the night (c'mon c'mon c'mon)
7 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..)

[Verse 1: Common]
It was once said by Black Thought that Things Fall Apart
Knew I shouldn't have been messin with dude's girl from start
But I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin'
Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate
Friend or no friend, my man caught wind
This chick is payin' me, it'll either cost me or cost him
Told her she shoulda lost him (when?) a while ago
'Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her yo
I ain't here to start on this [nigga] for me to wreck his broad
You could tell what I thought of this [nigga]
Nickname was Smoke, don't know if that was 'cause of cigarettes
(or what?) or guns he tote, he called shots on the deck
So I wasn't tryin' to call his bluff, by his persona
You could see, he think he tough!
If that wasn't enough, old girl had his son
This is Wild like the West I'm like Jesse on the run, uhh

[Jill Scott]
6 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gon' get through? (I, don't, know)
Can't go left and (uh-uh) can't go right and (uh-uh)
Don't know, how we made it through the night (yo, we got..)
5 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..)

[Verse 2: Common]
I understand that time is runnin' out, I'm thinkin' of town-skippin'
Got a Chevy but the alternator be trippin'
I'm hittin' rum straight, thinkin' of a route to truncate
The streets is watchin', out is one way I put myself in his Nike's
His position is, ""Aight man, somebody bonin' my lady""
Probably snap like Rod-man
My plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki (when?)
'round four, when she was comin' she would beep me
I sat deep in the corner, drinkin' zombies, becomin' one by now
Wonderin' if my style would support her and her child
Out the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized (who?)
One of Smoke's guys, to stay out of sight I tried
Told Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot
On some ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here"" [shit] like Deborah Cox
Looked at my watch, [shit] I don't even got a watch
Felt for my Glock, damnit I don't even got a Glock, yo

[Jill Scott]
4 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gon' get through? (I, don't, know)

Don't know, how we made it through the night (c'mon c'mon)
3 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..)

[Verse 3: Common]
Pressure puh-pressure what? The pressure's cookin'
It ain't good lookin', like a black promoter I'm talkin' bookin'
Not that I'm spooked of dude, I could whoop him
But he was on the horn informin' the rest of them hoodlums (aight)
Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine
Was messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time
My pager went off, it read one line: ""Come get me
From Halsted"", I'm thinkin' this is monkey bar [shit]
Went to the phone quick, called her (what happened?) Her line was busy
Situation number nine, got my mind dizzy
Wondered if this plan was designed to get me
I've been drinkin' too strong to be thinkin' too long
Like 40 goin' North I'm doin' 50, headed for the spot
Askin' God to be with me, and lately
She has been actin' shifty -- (but what?)
But then it hit me (hit me) it hit me (hit me)
It hit me (hit me) it hit me

[Jill Scott]
2 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gonna get through? (Yo -- I said I, don't, know)
Can't go left and (uh-uh) can't go right and (nope)
Don't know, how we made it through the night (yo, we got)

I knew just what it had to be
When I heard you say what you said to me
To every dude in sight
Look like you working up an appetite for the night, check it
By then I just sat at the back
Peeping you out, the way you act
Every string attached
Getting out of line and I'm yanking you back in your place
All is well and all is cool
Stay in your place, don't be no fool
We'll get along alright
You look like the type that would try to bite, mmm
Best off being a friend to me
You don't want to offend me
Better play it cool
Don't know what I might do

Oh, baby girl, I'm on to you (I'm watching you, girl)
Take it slow, change your speed
If it's food for thought that you really need
Better state your claim, get with it
Stay in your lane, stop swerving
Take a seat, sit in the back
I don't appreciate the way you act
You need to fix yourself, hurry up and go fix yourself
Can't kill nothing, won't nothing die
Everything's gonna pass you by
If you don't wisen up (Wisen up)
Stop pressing on luck (Pressing your luck)

87,21097,Elusive,blackwave.,"[Verse 1: jay.]
I remember day first came in that room filled with sun rays
With gin-juice as intake, therefor the smiley faces
From these sliding, gliding, grinding ladies
That vaguely had me gaping like a spaceman looks at human faces
Then you got right, in the corner of my eyes
Getting rendered on my retina, printed, saved inside my memory card
With a rhythm for my heart, more than visibly off the charts
So heartfelt, that I dealt, all cards I held, smart
Though, really, guy like I, try to stay far from sacrificing
But that day I'd give my life to get a slice of those voluptuous thighs
Easily top five I'd ever eyed
With an effortless granted victory, only, mostly 'cause I
Got mesmerized, by your atlantic eyes
Who left me stranded like poetry when I dove inside
To read your constellations, looking for conversation
Mainly, maybe some fornication with your mind

[Chorus: David Ngyah]
She took the funk out of my soul
My rhythm is bluesin'
I see the moods, that you been swinging over me
Climbing mountains we can climb together
I shed by standing in your way
Or is it the money that I can't pay

[Bridge: will.]
I just want it to be over
But i don't want to get over you
I just want it to be over
But i don't want to get over you
I just want it to be over
But i don't want to get over you
I just want it to be over
But i don't want to get over you

[Verse 2: jay.]
'Cause you're an elusive, intrusive, seducing, destructive seductress
Exclusively misusing your power for me to see the truth
And remove, release and leave all of my sorrow for tomorrow
Atleast that's what I'm told before you start the show
You'd make me see and peak, maybe feel underneath 'em clothes
Being up to something, seen that coming when you struck that pose
Yet I tried and tried to stay to play these games with you
Always knowing, I was destined to fail with you

[Chorus: David Ngyah]
She took the funk out of my soul
My rhythm is bluesin'
I see the moods, that you been swinging over me
Climbing mountains we can climb together
I shed by standing in your way
Or is it the money that I can't pay

[Bridge: will.]
I just want it to be over
But i don't want to get over you
I just want it to be over
But i don't want to get over you
I just want it to be over
But i don't want to get over you
I just want it to be over
But i don't want to get over you

[Chorus: David Ngyah]
She took the funk out of my soul
My rhythm is bluesin'
I see the moods, that you been swinging over me
Climbing mountains we can climb together
I shed by standing in your way

Sometimes shit is bad... (Don't)
Look

Don't feel no pity for me
'Cause I'm going through a couple things
Life means change
That's the way it goes, goes
All my life I had a constant burning
A strong deep desire
An aching ambiguous, yearning, yearning, yearning

For something better
For something bigger
For something wider
For something higher
And lots of regrets
'Cause I ain't seem to found it yet
I've been searching around the world
Never knowing what to expect
I get sad sometimes
Yes, I be mad sometimes
'Cause I'm out here on the grind
Making mine
And I still can't seem to find
What I've been looking for
Opened so many doors
For real, y'all
I just wanna be loved...

I just wanna be loved

When mind and your lights intertwined when you danced in my mind

I played who
Did the first song for you
Then my rise, not the lies, when you faced through curious space

Here in the moment
Let American race
And if I suppose if I can hold a moment in time
I hold a moment than to share with mine
Eyes locked, breath faded, weighted, tingling spine
Skin anticipating and touch electrified
The curvier your hips, curvier your lips you fine

And you know, that's right girl
Then you said you know it but with
But with, Falling forward, stopping can't hold it
It's not what I knowed, just what i wanted
So see you in the fall girl, girl lets go

And if I only had it, I would it have it all
It's critical when you moving it right
It's difficult for me to ever lose that sight
When you got it, you got it
You know that you about you're about to rocking it to the core
And people begging for more
And you'd end up like a fool
And I suppose as last
First glance, First bash, first chance, first breath
First drink, first crutch
And I'mma die to it, ride through it
I'm in love with the vibe to it
The way it makes me feel inside is just
So baby would you ride with me ?
Baby would you ride with me ?
Hold my hand and turn that lips
Just Love my like I need you babe
Just Love my like I need you babe

[Chorus]
All I want is to love you
And all I need is to touch you
All these nights have been so long
All these days I've sang your song

All I want is to love you
And all I need is to touch you
All these nights have been so long
All these days I've sang your song

All I want is to love you
And all I need is to touch you
All these nights have been so long
All these days I've sang your song

All I want is to love you
And all I need is to touch you
All these nights have been so long
All these days I've sang your song
I sang your song
I sang your song

Heartache can't heal my pain
Me and you together haven't been the same
I don't wanna play these games
But I want it before these days

[Chorus]
Heartache can't heal my pain
Me and you together haven't been the same
I don't wanna play these games
But I want it before these days

[Verse 1]
Girl, you're like a good cigarette
Killing me slowly but right now you know that I'm lovin' it
Barely together, aw man, we really strugglin'
Filling my void up, damn I'm really a mess
I'm in love with my stuff, but you're out for my gut
I am getting so tough, but it's getting so rough
Can't believe with my eyes, all the shit in my life
Sticking out for my guys, sticking out for your lies
Easing up on my pain, all these drugs are the same
The first time I had my own way
You know that I am happy for you
But I can't be happy with you

[Chorus]
Heartache can't heal my pain
Me and you together haven't been the same
I don't wanna play these games
But I want it before these days

[Chorus]
Heartache can't heal my pain
Me and you together haven't been the same
I don't wanna play these games
But I want it before these days

[Verse 2]
Headaches and hangovers, from this
Heartache and painkillers
Lovesick then I'm gon' age older,
Life gets so short then much colder
Fucking perfect but a goddamn disaster
Cautious of my words, I gotta keep my shit in order
Running out the room you're telling me that I'm the problem
I'm taking the blame and I ain't ever fucking caused it
Well, that's what I get for sticking with you
Coulda been so clean livin' life like a dream
When all I could think about was when I would leave
Yeah all I could think about is when I would leave and

[Chorus]
Heartache can't heal my pain
Me and you together haven't been the same
I don't wanna play these games
But I want it before these days

[Chorus]
Heartache can't heal my pain
Me and you together haven't been the same
I don't wanna play these games
But I want it before these days

We set the rhythm, the groove, with nu’n to lose
Box’s all up in your face hit like dominick cruz
We brought the juice, the food to get ya system improved
To get ya head bop, that head bop what I try to induce
When I mix up, consume, leave the crowd with amazement
Once they sync to my frequency like radio station
Cause the flow is fire, style is gifted as shown
Once it’s delivered, see you shiver from ya flesh to the bone
Leave the speaker’s status blown when I get on that microphone
With ‘em rhymes in my pocket I pop it, I rock it, I own
Ya energy, energy, all i need to get you what you need
Every, every, enemy, turned to friend for I proceed
You dig it, you feel it, right? Which was the intention
Hey, thanks for being subject to my latest invention

All this trouble on my mind, I gotta shake it (Shake it)
Kick it out my dome and get to playing (Playaa!)

Better get my ass to class, make it fast cuz’ I’m tryna pass and twist
Every single plot, on every single shot
Exceed them expectations as expected round the clock

[Verse 3: will.]
That’s why I ain’t pushing no breaks
Until this shit breaks me
Until all hell breaks loose and
They ask me: ‘What’s good?’
Imma tell ‘em: ""All good, still at it
Working on myself like an ill medic
Still headed to the top with the top off
Need a Cadillac ‘for I can take some time off""

You should be stronger than me
You been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

[Chorus]
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

[Verse 2]
You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?

[Chorus]
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

He said, ""The respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn""
I said, ""You don't know what love is, get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script""

I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

Lifes good *8

Verse:
I need to get my mind right
Somebody said i need therapy
Im Like
Maybe I do why pay somebody who
Listens to problems for a living
I got nothing to lose
Except the change in my pocket
But i spend it on weed
After the car note, the bills, and the rent for the lease
Plus the debt piling up
Standing right at my knees
Government noose starts to tightens
Getting Harder to breathe
Plus
Perception of self isnt where it should be
Sanity's at the door
Its preparing to leave
It's all good
Cause the crazy have some crazy ideas
So you can dip and I'll make crazy bread
Fuck you thought nigga
This the shit that i really do
God spoke and he told me to be more spiritual
Starting Sunday ill be back in the church
Coming Monday ill be snatching a purse
Cause he forgives right
Plus my sins justified by the ends
Only 24 living with too many regrets
So i down a handle of Henny and just pray i forget
The mistakes I made in the past that i can never amend
Or pay amends
I can’t even pay a Ten
Shunned by people in the
*Cough*
Shunned by the people in the 1 percent
I just need a couple commas till I’m walking in
And so I went to math class
You already know i passed that
My teacher gave a 100 percent
I said bitch
I need some commas past that

100,21145,Keep It Jazzy,Exact Change Project,"Verse 1
I bump Monk in the morning man
That’s my sorta jam
Horace Silver on the keys, Wayne Shorter and
Freddie Hubbard blowin’ bubbles on his trumpet man
That’s really something man
Ain’t it something man?
Well on the other hand
A Miles solo flies me over to another land
Miles smiles, miles in the sky
Birth of cool, kind of blue
Bitches brew, which are you?
----guess it all depends on the situation that you facin’
Or the day of the week
Now jazz is a language that’s crazy to speak
Cause ya ain’t sayin nothin if ya phrasing is weak
I stay shaping the beat
But it’s a difficult task at hand to make ya neck snap
Eva seen Art Blakey vexed at
Elvin, Max Roach, Haynes or Philly joe
Damn he kept the beat really tight like a philly roll
With the rolls fills and the way that he filled the role
But few steal the show like Jack de Johnette, Jimmy Cobb
Billy Higgins, really getting in the swing of things
I love the feelin’ swingin’ brings
I need Mingus for the bass
I need Billie Holiday to sing this
I need Coltrane, I need the fingers
Of Jarret and Evans, I mean the thing is
The way the note lingers
Through the late hours as I’m soarin’
Awaken in the mornin’
Dexter Gordon oratory roarin up in my auditorium
Transmittin’ storybooks, in a stormy form
Creating life within the song he formed
Man you musta got the story wrong
This ain’t nothing like the corny norm
Nah this ain’t nothing like the corny norm

Chorus
Keep it jazzy
That's my only request
Keep it swingin’
Keep it swingin’ and fresh

Keep it cool
Keep it cool and tight
We got the vibe
We got ya feelin alright

Verse 2
While the whole world wildin, I keep silent
Knocked em all ova wit the bowling ball shit that we stylin
Plus the beat got me smiling
It’s so chill, it’s hard to come hardcore
For real, to all the freshmen and sophomores
We the class of veterans schoolin the seniors
Two queens MCs, wit
True demeanor of jazz cats
Ayo pass that
Too many famous MCs thats asscrack
Look out below, the shit we droppin is hazmat
Stand back
Make sure you got ya helmet on and ya stance raw
Hope you prepared for, the mad raw hands-on exhibit in a rare form
The bass drops and hits you like a hail storm
Hard to bail from the maelstrom but this is that official shit ----- put the stamps on your passport
Your last thought, when did EC blast off
This cat told me that jazz is elevator music
I guess it’s all relative depending how you view it
We’re takin it straight up to the top floor
And if you don’t feel it why your head bop for?
I got rhymes
Like blue note’s got records
Enough for millions of measures
I’m deep, but not feelin’ the pressure
My speech, got feelin’ and gestures
My reach, international sectors
We free, not constricted or stressin’
And we stay regeneratin’ cool, fool

Chorus
Keep it jazzy
That's my only request
Keep it swingin’
Keep it swingin’ and fresh

Keep it cool
Keep it cool and tight
We got the vibe
We got ya feelin alright

101,21124,Blue,Gas Lab,"Qué viejo es el blues de los desheredados
Iguales a vos, no saben de dios, pero sí del pecado
No viven del aire, apenas lo han probado
Huyen de la muerte y el tiempo a su suerte los ha abandonado

En este mundo grotesco hay demasiado soldado
Nos han dejado de lado, de pies y manos atados
Estamos solos en esto, cuando protesto es a dios y al estado
Beben de la sеd perpetua del dеsamparado

Yo no puedo ofrecer miel, tan sólo sal en la herida
Para que arda la piel y despierte a la fe dormida
Es una misión suicida: el potro nace desbocado
Y amanece en el averno otro día nublado

Yo creo en la educación contra el abuso de poder
Pero cierran una escuela con sus almas de alquiler
Y de buscar el alfiler, la estocada ya es costumbre
Encaja su alcazaba los temblores de la muchedumbre

Mucha hambre y poco pan, poco pan y mucho circo
Atrapados en la trampa del egocentrismo
Poco folclore y mucho turismo
Coreografía sombría de los espías que surgen de uno mismo

Y que el tiempo decore los panteones con flores
Mientras ajenos patrones ponen sus condiciones
Una deuda es propia, la otra es del FMI
Entre la espada y el revólver sin poder salir

Todo eso pasa como una brisa fugaz
Que es la misma que arrasa en una enorme nube de gas
La pesada carcasa que sólo usamos ante los demás
Y de regreso a casa me pone a pensar:

Qué viejo es el blues de aquellos olvidados
Iguales a vos, no saben de dios, pero sí del pecado
No viven del aire, apenas lo han probado
No tienen derecho, ni patria, ni techo y por un altercado

Los mandan en cana, de por vida encerrados
Se juegan a suertes la cama en que duermen que es de cartón mojado
Pero qué viejo es el blues de los descerebrados
Los vota la gente para presidente, para diputado

When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
Then she gets plenty more, uhh

{repeat Chorus One}
[Guru]
Uhh
Watchin her drivin by, in her new whip so fly
Wish she could sing me a lullaby, to scoop her I've got to try
In her eyes, there's a flame that burns right through my soul
Can't pretend to be cool, about to lose my control
Yeah I know she's got plenty; admirers, she's got many
Like an exotic fantasy, into a frenzy she sends me
Wow I have to sit down, and gather my wits now
I want to caress those hips now, want to kiss those lips now

[Badu]
Hello? Hey babyyy
I know you called and I didn't answer twice
But baby that's oh-kay it's nice
For you to call anyway see, okay, see uhh
Hey babyyy
You know it's okay if you don't call me
Anymore cause I got a-plenty
Truckload of niggas like you at my door {*dial tone*}

[Chorus One]
[Guru]
Yup
And every day is her day, and every year is her year
Anyone tried to violate, they could straight disappear
She don't care if you play yourself, tryin to step to her
The illest of gangsters, I show and respect to her
Truly glamourous, she ain't impressed and it shows
She don't like your new clothes, she don't care about your playa pose
Do you suppose I could hook up and spend time with her?
She's just how I dreamed - I'll bust my nine for her

[Chorus Two: Erykah Badu]
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
Any damn thang she wants, uhh

[Guru]
Uhh
Surgeon General - I provide vitamins and minerals
The charge that she's got on me, should be federal
I was told never put the two before the one son
But always cultivate your Wisdom, to help you build your kingdom
I want to be the answer to every question she has
So when I wish to enter, she'll be lettin me pass
I know she wants to be with G-O-D eventually, but still
She got everything; yeah the girl's got plenty

[Badu]
Flowers in her bedroom
Perfume on her neck
Nectar from a mason jar
Seven dollar dress; she's
Super cute, and plenty bad
Thirty twenty-two thirty-six and a half
I, hope the dude will realize
She got the silky(?) (?)sexy bedroom eyes
Baby baby please don't break yo' neck
Cause you gon' have a wreck {*tires squeal*}
Cause when it comes to love I get plenty, degrees one-twenty
My back slipped out my dress - OOPS!

[Chorus Three: Erykah Badu]
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty (she gets it all)
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (uhh)
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (c'mon)
And she gets plenty more (plenty more) ahh
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (mm, she gets it all)
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
And any damn thang I want - right?

[Guru]
That's right
In this game of life it takes a lot to win
Plenty more baby's what I got to give

[Badu]
Yeah yeah baby that's really nice
But I'm tryin to read my book and you're in my light

[Guru]
Uhh - a woman like you could help me reach the top
If I get a chance to love you, mm, I won't stop

[Badu]
Damn! Oh huh, what? Huh, whaaat?
I didn't hear you I was thinkin bout some stuff

[Guru]
Baby you so fine I want to smack myself
I don't need no support I'm gonna back myself

[Badu]
Hooo baby you so sweet
Now can you get the lotion and rub my feets

[Guru]
In massage therapy I got a master degree
I give you plenty more, than what you askin from me

[Badu]
I need a little bit of space, a little bit of wealth (okay)
And oh - about the feets, a little to the left (like this?)

Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost died
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Verse 1: Saba]
Ayy, how you lonely in a room with God?
Never slow up, not even a pit stop
Praying my niggas'll never get caught
Overcame it all, like I'm some big shot
Was taught to be a man, up to the wrist watch
To the collar shirt tucked, with the front pocket
Part of adolescence when they go blossom
When your stars align, I hope there's no comet
So far it's...
Oh yes, I made it alive, on the West Side
Still at my momma house
The kids on my conscience now
'Cause the youth dying and it's just more common now
Common ground, stuck through it all like we Carmelo
Comin' down, high off of life, arrive unannounced
Summonin', numbin' the pain of when I'm in doubt, high school
My head in the clouds, like I learned about

[Chorus: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize

And I tend to tell what is honest
I don't wanna fight no one, no contest
I just wanna undress my conscience
I just met a killer that's bent in his ways
Try to raise a family with minimum wage, what can I say?
Besides the demons, it's reality for the people that we love
And we are the ones that will team up and tee up the party
Dead end the school, bet that they'll show up real tardy
The audience awfully ready and rowdy
I meant it if I said it, you get it in writing
Got into a science, but write with the lightning
Like soil, I'm grounded, the seed has just sprouted

[Chorus: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost died
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Post-Chorus: Jean Deaux & Saba]
What are you looking for?
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
All, the things you adore
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
Show what you want, show what you want
Show what you want, show what you want

[Outro: Billy Williams]
I just wanna be the plug so my people can eat
I just wanna play soccer on rooftops in Tokyo
I just wanna find somewhere I don't gotta put a face on for people no mo'
Yours truly, Billy Williams

106,21130,That Jazz,Coops,"Talking all that jazz
(Cuts)

Yeah
So pass the mic and let me motivate
Movements for the music get your soul to shake
Hold on wait
Claiming you’re the sickest and they sold no tapes
I can tell you're rookie from your jumper stage till spitting in your vocal break
Today I woke up late I was dreaming scheming
Trying to find some deeper meaning
Astral projecting I’m beaming
Can someone help me get down from the ceiling
Cause I’m floating puff-puff pass then I know
I’m toking potent to keep my focus open
I’m in the kitchen cooking soul food
Same time I’m having sex over the surface
Coops you so crude
Most of these rappers ain’t got no clue
I got that special recipe
Their necessity they bringing less than me
So be ready to draw your weapon see
Cause I’m a veteran G
I write this bars using telepathy
Leaving MC's in jeopardy
No one can second me
I’m moving to guys like Kazuya (Mishima) in Tekken 3

Please…

Stop talking (all that Jazz)
Stop talking (all that Jazz)
Stop talking (all that Jazz)
Stop talking (all that Jazz)

Yeah
These man are jazzing
While I’m on the beat spazzing
Got the magic touch I’m guessing he hasn’t
And her feet in the air
Tell her to give her an orgasm
Opened (up) with a small cousin
With a thing that should win
The beauty pageant
Imagination coordination
Of my demonstration through the celebration
Of microphone exhalation
Got no expectation for this generation
In this foolish nation
That is trying figure who is the coolest waste man
In this world of product placements and mass displacement
I just stay making bangers in the basement
Keep the world adjacent
This is a scary place where is Freddy and Jason
Feeling to smack him in the face
I’m aggravated and impatience
Terrorizing the terrorist I’m trying to fuck my therapist
Living in London till it's derelict or they bury it
You can find me on the ferry list smoking on some cherry shit
On my way to Amsterdam the way I live is very sick

Yeah

Stop talking (all that Jazz)
Stop talking (all that Jazz)
Stop talking (all that Jazz)
Stop talking (all that Jazz)

While my grandmother's scarf comforts me
But you look ugly
And I ain't ever trippin' 'bout the lack of company
Cause honestly I'm sittin' here alone quite comfortably
Depressed through this dimension
And I think I failed to mention
That I feel like I been runnin' outta seconds
Nobody gave a forewarning nor a preface
Followin' my dreams feel like followin' my death wish

[Verse 1]
She said she know just how that stress gets
When you hungry and you just tryna eat breakfast and nobody feel your message feel
Good enough to wake up and then fall back to sleep
It's a bad car to go get involved in like half the shit that I see
Plus I feel happier in my dreams, right
I spit that shit that give the feeling of the seaside
Hungover in Pitts
But with the flick of the wrist
Yo I can kick shit like this
I be as good as it gets
Even through all my vices
My inner being Rastafarian
Always one-hunnid three times you'll get Spartacus
What's with all you knock-offs, and self-conscious narcissists?
Said I'm an artist bitch, do this shit so artifice
In it for the hardships the nonsense of reapin' attention
Homie rolled up a blessing
We in a world with no exits
You gotta give me a second
Straighten up and get balanced
My homie flipped on a record
I beat it up ain't no challenge

[Refrain]
I smoke that weed while my grandmother's scarf comforts me
But you look ugly
And I ain't ever trippin' bout the lack of company
Cause honestly I'm sitting here alone quite comfortably
Depressed through this dimension
And I think I failed to mention
That I feel like I've been running outta seconds
Nobody gave a forewarning nor a preface
Followin' my dreams (let's go) feel like followin' my death wish

[Verse 2]
Ayo, reach and you slip a backpedal
I do my homework blazed and gets A's I'm mad mellow
I hear the sad fellows get they fix when I spit
Like that sun up in the sky you must protect or you get hit
Sometimes life is full of shit too many damn to-do lists
But yo I learned if you ain't coolin' you just being foolish
I used to think that I'ma die early, like mid-thirties
But fuck that I'ma rise early, and ride dirty
I reach the crucifix up to my lips and then I kiss it
I try to walk with God but got some holes up in my slippers
And so I keep on slippin'
Get tangled in the mischief
So in a nutshell I'm just a sinner named Christian
But still they keep me spinnin' when they drinkin' on they lonely
High rollin' like Jody, eyes open, got stolen by this music shit
And I don't think I'm coming back (what that is bro)
Everybody rockin' plaid we look like lumberjacks (straight up), ayo

[Refrain]
I smoke that weed while my grandmother's scarf comforts me
But you look ugly
And I ain't ever trippin' bout the lack of company
Cause honestly I'm sittin' here alone quite comfortably
Depressed through this dimension

1,2 1,2 yes!
Yo, it's King Geedorah, combined with the forces of nine ether
Blowing woofers and tweeters, shaking syllable meters
Disaster's cataclysmic, mystic natural
It's about time we hit y'all with some substance that's actual
I got a gift called hip-hop prophecy
Since 2003 ends the reign of the jiggy MC
No more roaming on this planet like scavengers
Scientists broke the code of the Gregorian calendar
Defying laws of space and time
Trying to trace my lines, hold up, respect the architect
Digital Roland, my whole crew roll with VS
Type to master this whole universe in three steps
We stretch across the equator with something major
Universal rhyme tones, tamper with ya time zone
Minds blown by the millions just for the feeling
Hip-hop, it just don't stop until I make a killing
Nah I'm kidding, but for real
The world ain't the same no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Word up, word up

[Verse 2: ID 4 Winds]
Well I'm colliding with the mind of a
Survivor surviving, uncover the time brother
The high volume wide column, Height slalom
Preferred jog on the side
Dodgin' mirages, conquer the vibe, hunger lurks
Nine to five work saga, God bless the life
Father trife, travel to light
Balance the globe off life, vocal pimpin' its throat
So you know how it go down yo
Struggle in the ghetto yo
Metal throat, settle the dough, live showbiz
The cannonball, weapon, Man At Arms four section
Super intelligence, balance benevolent stinging nettle medicine
Crouch tiger, dragon, craftmatic
Watch ya back, if, catch this passes through the atlas
First class diplomatic status stagma flag
Then overstanding the plan
Bar scan, identify camera shots
Streets watch, Timex clocks
Punch lunch on the dot, five minutes to rock
So we blew block crews, it's old news how we do...

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Empress Stahhr]
I'mma drop one rhyme, for every time I cross the thin line
Between yours and mine, see, it's part of my design
Shifting paradigm, Yin and yang combined
Must be out ya mind thinking Stahhr would never shine
Props due, focused with a hawk's eye view (Uh)
I'm all that, a plantain, and some Ital stew
Gettin' spinach, British, ATL to Venice
Even Abercrombie figures open off of this verb elixir
Magnetic attraction, raw as Millie Jackson
Straight openin' the captions, here comes the Hicks and Braxton
Lyrical contraction, delivery reaction
It started with a passion, that's just the way it happened
Born with umbilical cords strapped to Korgs
Won’t drop a Kurzweil hustling Zip disk files
Sharper than needles, found no IV's for the feeble
Y'all fiending for the sequel and the beat's not even EQ'd

I don't magnify my mistakes I just appreciate
The lesson nothing less I got no regrets
Still I got more decisions to make more repercussions to take
Find my therapy in percussion on production man
I lay my burdens down by the riverside
One day I'm trynna to see the bigger side
I'm chasing for the light because I've been in dim inside
But shit there ain't never been no fear inside
I couldn't have survived this far man this shit will get you penalized
In this game of life you play you waste another day
If you afraid to grow progression stunted by your pain
I say you stuntin' if you spend your time jumping between today
And everything that's passed you
You can't even see what's past you
Appreciate the present man don't let your gift depreciate
You'll never know when you'll need 'em
My doubt famished because I never feed 'em
Alleviate my clouds just to help me feed the way

Me and my nigga Phoniks rock like geologists
Paleontologists, resurrecting the fossils I'm an alchemist
Savage like Randy I'm steady crashin' just debt it you never had it
How can a nigga live a dream that he ain't seen
Just trynna act out the scenes but don't really know what they mean
How we say we got purpose when we don't know what our worth is
Only know what they tell us on the surface, but I'm digging deeper
That a swishas that I'm hittin' smoke I don't release
Askin' myself whatchu gonna do when they reminisce over you
I wonder if C.L. ever figured it out
Well if he didn't shit I'm living it out
Figured I'd talk to whoever gon' hear me out
My head full just I share my thoughts just as I clear them out I swear it never stops
Therapeutic man this music shit here free my soul
Trynna take it as far as it goes

C'mon
Dedicate this record to you and yours
All of ours
Little feel good music by the globetroddas
Proof, Thought, and Lyrics produced by Disco
And uh...
I know it get's tough out there
You know what I'm sayin
Struggles for real...
Maybe this'll help you out man


[Verse 1]
I know you gotta make your run
But man, Spend some time with your daughter or your son
Take a day or two to some 'em some fun
Play your part as a dad
Be responsible for what they become
Because maybe that long talk, firm hug or that laugh
Will help your kid read fluently or better at math
It's gonna take more than just a school staff
To prepare them for the struggle that awaits in their path
It takes love
You want the cars and the raw chains
But you don't thank the Lord above for the small things
The food in your fridge, your girl or your wife
The source of it all, the one that brings the drive in your life
Don't get me twisted, be about your bread
But let the truth be said
You'll go so further if you pray before you go to bed
I put my heart in this song
Because I've seen hate stirring us wrong
But we can fix it with love

Chorus (x2):
The Globetroddas take your soul a ride
Put all the pain and the strain and the stress aside
Release yourself, don't be ashamed to do what you feel inside
Throw up your hands, show some love. Love!

[Verse 2]
I got love; for the first rapper paving the way
To the highest paid rapper today
Showed a young, inner city kid another way of livin'
Who could have been another nigga dead or in prison
Although the block brought me stress
The block made me fresh
The block propped me and wished me the best
So when the homies got it rough out there
We just reminisce the old days; chilling while we put it in the air
Out of love
We throw the family get-togethers backyard in the summer
Party with no drama
And dance with our Mamas to Pac's ""Dear Mama""
We grub good under the sun and pay homage
To the elders, and gather 'round taking pictures
And listen to that uncle who lies and bullshits ya
And watch the little ones grow tight, run around 'til the sun goes down
The whole vibe of this sound is straight love

Chorus (x2)

[Verse 3]
Globetrodda front-liner Derrick Buck
Here with Drew, Big Drak and Chuck
To turn it out no question, but mainly here to pass down a message:
Your lifetime's the ultimate blessing
Focus on the big picture and it puts it in perspective
I know it gets hectic at times and nerve-wrecking
But the sunshine's coming; good times are rolling along
The struggle's only making us strong
It's all love

Seven years old, I asked Christ and the genie
Ten years old, I seen my friend die really
Genie in the bottle though it's Jenny on the block
I'm Houdini with the Uzi, holy father, wake me up
Time-traveller, that boy, he a star
Blowing bubbles in the faces of the people afar
'97 Hov playing, trunk rattled the car
Wet lick done licked the gold stars of my heart
Golden roses over enemies and sprinkled with serenity
Tryna stain the legacy, pray to Allah
And fo' sho', got you rappers Instagramming your ma
With that North Face jacket, blade tucked in my-
Way, way before the tomb came the womb, no question
And out came his black ass, remember, you was yellow with your
Black bandana with your fingers all twisted
June 19th '87 in the kitchen
The straw that broke the camel's back, in love with your life
Have you ever walked home afraid, alone in the night?
Have you ever taken drink inside the loo just in case?
Cause the fears of a man just like God to my cape
And the rap game crazy but the coke came at 'em
Eve came home feeling fruity and we smashing
All of that ass got me feeling real ratchet
The chicken came before the egg and way before the atoms
Cancelling the shows and making money off of acting
Rain, rain pouring like the bezels in my chalice

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
Potentially
We could build a galaxy
This you-and-I-verse could be

The man rose, little concrete roads
Put your hands together, folks, for the black roach
'Bout to deliver like Stagecoach
Know I stay posted, my nigga (that was it), yo, what's the signs?
My fountain of youth is all drying, one minute, we all smiling
Then poof, we fall silent and I've been digging deep
For this thing, I ain't finding this
Either I'm insane in my brain or to be honest, that's
Probably what it is
Done seen a lot of shit that you probably can't live with
You probably can't stomach, you probably can't ingest
At times, we were so hungry, got mad dreams and wishes
It'll all get sunny, but for now it's this money that
Determines and divides, that's insuring our lives
Even causing homicides on the streets of NY
A little shorty asked me what's my purpose and why?
I told him save the children and point them right at the light
He said for sure, that's tight, but where the dollar signs in that
Them hella fine dimes with that ass so fat
That Phantom and the Maybach, that black MAC that go crick-crack
That's when I say yo, chill, shorty, relax
Let me open your mind to the current times
If visions is colourblind, it's fine, your light will still shine as
I consume this time he begin to unravel
And travel to a place he thought that he would never find, uh

[Bridge 2: Joey Bada$$]

[Verse 1]
Realizing the realism of life
And actually it ain't half bad
I'm puttin yin and yang in the same bag
Got another story to tell so gather round
As I open up my thoughts and tell you what's going down
Been down on my luck my parents splittin up my granny just passed away
Another passing day asked my pastor to help me past today
He said pray to your father I tried to place a call
But I think my signal's crossed can't hear nothing at all
Maybe it's too loud
My surrounding could maybe be drowning what I need to hear
Distractions coming from ear to ear
Could use some peace of mind
Gave a piece of my mind
To niggas who really be testing my peace all the time
From the city where envious entities by the plenty
Fake smiles fake handshakes these niggas semi
Halfway loyal when you down they ignore you
But when you up they adore you
It's the same old tale
On these same streets that I know so well
I kept it thorough that's what thing that time gon' tell
Ain't never touched a million but I live wealthy
Rich as hell ain't nothing you can tell me
Sometimes I tell myself

[Verse 2]
They say you can't see the forest through the trees
Way too many leaves
Would make a nigga leave and quit his dreams
Boys just want that destination
They ain't in it for the journey
Adversity really bringing out the worst but it don't concern me
I got a fire burning my lighter been burning all day
Always on the clock just tryna get it in all ways
Time is all we got but its limits don't show my limits
I'm just a little nigga that's stuck in a tall maze
I can't see the light I bust a left and a right
Another left
I'm just hoping I'm making the right decisions
'Cause I learned that even a right choice will come with consequences
I'm uppercutting repercussions if they ever presented
Now is a present I'm just tryna share my gifts with whoever down with me
Sharin' shit whoever wanna listen
Bun told a young nigga keep pushin'
I'm a keep movin' you can keep lookin'
But it's all good

It ain't all good but it's all good

Got me like

[Hook: Nieve]
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me grab the mic
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me have the mic

[Verse 1: Nieve]
I'm getting older I'm no longer the young pro
So ain't no little kid going to tell me I'm done for
And you ain't even worth it to rhyme to
Just thought I'd go and leave a little note to remind you
In case you want to stir the pot up
Cause a little drama
You don't really want to battle
I'll say things you never thought of
And have never seen
You caught a line and became a fiend
My dope rhyme like amphetamine
You had a dream
The type to make you think you fall through
Who you think you are you ain't too big to sock two
A kick one, I grab the mic and I spit son
Try to share the soul laying low in my system
And say whatever it just don't
Matter anymore I know my future is destined
To carry on
There's no baggage thats heavy on
My shoulders are very strong
You know

[Hook: Nieve]
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me grab the mic (grab the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me have the mic (have the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me grab the mic (grab the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me have the mic (have the mic)

[Verse 2: Nieve]
Uh, It's just the same old motif
The heart never safe pretty girls a cold thief
She got away
The way she move make you want to stay
It's kind of smooth how she stalk her prey
I walk away
Don't blame me if you see me look back though
She fit me to a Texas T baby was black gold
And from my rap flow
I thought I had her but I guess it didn't matter she didn't think it was that dope
Leave the girl with the ""woe is me""
Just another slide show in my poetry
Picture me rollin' in a five hundred
Buying roses in the dozen for the lady I want won't that be something
But I'm worried it will never be
Too many games be played love
We use it in a phrase like a spelling bee
Putting her spell on me
Hypnotized
Was the devil in disguise, she decided the hell with me

[Hook: Nieve]
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me grab the mic (grab the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me have the mic (have the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me grab the mic (grab the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while its like this now so let me have the mic
Yeah

117,21113,Yesterday,Atmosphere,"[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I didn't stop 'cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could've shouted out your name
But even if it was you, I don't know what I would say
We could sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of light
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

[Chorus]
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you?
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you?

[Verse 2]
I'm shook, I know I pushed when I should've pulled
Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul
And I would make a top-notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
I can't front, I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit
I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with?
There's no way that you and I will ever get to reopen it
It doesn't matter, this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of

[Chorus]
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you?
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you?

[Verse 3]
And when you left, I didn't see it coming
I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running
You crept out the front door slow
And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know
And by the the time I looked up, it was booked up
Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept
You disappeared, but the history is still here
That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer
I can't even get mad that you're gone
Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me
I'm sorry, it's official
I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins
Had so much hatred, now it brings me shame
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I know it wasn't you 'cause you passed away, Dad

[Chorus]
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you?

Just to get the writings on my paper right
Lost sight from the shine of my crown
So now I ride, with the windows down
I can never figure out if you playing
Got no time to be wasting so now I
Got my spaceship on the move with no destination
Just appreciate it, how could you possibly not dig it
With the vibe we came in, it’s so frustrating
That they getting outta control when given food to the soul
Soul’s are being sold and now they take ‘em by force
So take a little bit of this and a little bit of that
Little bit of jazz, little bit of trap
Oh sometimes, all I wanna do is dab, dab, dab
(And that’s why)

119,21119,Wanna Remind You,Dizzy Wright,"[Intro]
We're back up in this thing, this State of Mind 2 thing
You know, little Ziggy changed everything
Zay done changed everything
But the vibes is still the same
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Proceed to reminisce
Think about my early goals (my goals)
This journey's been legit (legit)
Look at how I touch these souls (uh-huh)
Look at how I always handle myself
This don't come lucky, no (oh, no)
Sensitive about my shit
Soul food for the country folks
I was in this funky boat
They like ""God damn it, he happy""
Spreading that world peace while they throwing their monkey wrenches at me
No love lost, no monthly distractions we come 'cross
Wasn't waiting for nothing to jump off
But I took that leap though
We come from zero, nothing, nathan, nada so God is my hero (she is)
The black sheep of my family, but even family can have the biggest egos (they can)
Watch our youngsters, I see you
From Flint to Vegas on my P's and Q's, as I keep meeting people
Yeah, I'm blessed and peaceful
Be humble, K. Dot style (that's right)
You wait too long and next thing you know life starts to wear you down
I believe that prayer counts
So, count your blessings, partner
My voice symbolic
Ask my roster, I always been silent
Before I'm forgotten, I just...

[Hook]
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something
You ain't the only one, you ain't
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something
Better yet, when your lifestyle change
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner

[Verse 2]
Let me make this crystal clear
I'm coming strictly fitted (that's right)
Like, fuck them dress codes, y'all could miss me with it
I do my thing and them ladies fall down for them hippie spirits
I hop on stage and do my 60 minutes
Pushing that independence
Good weed is all I need
That TGA2 shit gon' get y'all where y'all need to be (y'all need to be)
I see exactly where I fucked around with make believe
Never take it hard, I just find different ways to take the lead (take off)
Doing bad business is a sunken place for me (I know it is)
Never hypnotized, unless it's life after death and that's a Biggie album (talk to 'em)
One time, for all of the greats
Sometimes I can't imagine how y'all lived without the space
And I'm not talking about the bigger houses
Sometimes it scares me that the bigger you get, you lock away
But I got a lot to say, so they gon' always have a Dizzy album
They gon' remember that I was a man of my word
It's not what you gained or you earned
It's about what you came and you learned
Telling the little homies like...

Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something
You ain't the only one, you ain't

Better yet, when your lifestyle change
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, I hope you see me God
You taught me that holding the throne won't be no easy job
They throwing their sticks and stones, but still I remain so peacefully calm (uhh)
Dealing with these creepy times (uh-huh)
They sleepy, I get noisy
No, nigga, you can't avoid me
I'll be there shortly
Flying under the radar, right around the corner
From another brother's story, wishing you glory (I see you)
I see y'all shining though
Like diamonds on these new age rappers that's been trying to flow (that's been trying to flow)
Y'all like my little brothers that looked up and hit the lottery
And that's not being logical (ha-ha)
I been connecting the dots like dominos
Got to count it up yourself, yo, or you could be held accountable
This ain't a history lesson, y'all, more like victory down the road, so (victory down the road)
Keep it real, never fake
Who cares, as long as they can relate
It's too many people in this world to go one way
The human race is mixed up like liquor (let 'em know)
Thinking about it when I wake up trying to get 'em all with us
I know that me and all the homies, man..

Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something
You ain't the only one, you ain't
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something
Better yet, when your lifestyle change
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner

120,21104,Thoughts,Mickey Cho,"[Verse 1 - Sam Ock]
'Tis the time to tell a tale too tall
Take a tip or two cents from a thought too small
Full of insecurity to the teeth trying to take it
So it's barenaked so he thought that he could fake it
And be found of fear full of force and fury
Folly fed frailness the future felt blurry
And faith though familiar fell a few feet far
His fickling [?] heart feels a tad torn apart
The daily dose of daring to do different
To make a mark or message the music may be missing
A message of Christ a message of life
A message of day a message that would burn through the night
I'm trying to understand as a young man
How to reconcile the Christ in me with who I really am
So you call it art, but it's (for) me a music form
To give glory to God that's for what I hope

[Verse 2 - J. Han]
Hm... They're expecting perfection
So as a fallible man how do you step
With integrity and excellence the mistakes are inevitable
Every thing you hide it away in a crucible
Then fester and boil your inner turmoils
It makes your chaos feel your anger and a bit of holy a-h
As an architect artist or an actor
Do you pin the Christian tag before or after
Regardless where I put it I'm
Smashed into pudding if I'm far from my release
I'll just regain my footing
You can call me cheesey you can call me corny
But you can't deny the skills and artistry that I be owning
In the lavatory trying to comprehend and tell my story
From my childhood days to my college dormitory thus
This balancing act I can't forfeit
Keeps me in check when I'm drifting out of orbit

[Verse 3 - Mickey Cho]
I'm feeling like a giant, taller than Goliath
Not because I'm great, but because I'm repping I AM
I used to be about only me so defiant
'Til I gave my life away
Now I find that I am flying even higher than the sky
I'm soaring through the galaxies
Fire in my eyes got Summers on the rapper be
Inspired by the lines of The Word no blasphemy
Tired of the slime put these other rappers after me
Tell me what's the aftermath I feel like it's a tragedy
The topics that these rappers rap about so casually
Sex money drugs
Morally decapitating everything I love
Can I wave they're gone magically huh?
Cause the children are the casualties
A tall price to pay like a fish fillet from Applebee's
I'm all about the honour
The standard that I stand for the higher that the standard is
The standard that demands more and I'mma meet the quota
A new breed of rapper that will change all the negativity the rappers shown us
In an industry full of shallow means to make a profit is an emcee
I relent to thee, speaking as a prophet over all the nonsense
I could care less if I can make you shake your booty but your soul remains unblessed
That's the reason I spit it to the best of my ability
Forever I'll be killing these beats yes

121,21100,Ode To Nujabes,Funky DL,"[Scratch Intro]
Big up my man Nujabes [x4]

[Verse One]
Chilling in my bedroom it’s morning, I’ve not long woke up
Heard a ring, ring so I picked my telephone up
Who’s this? “Sebajun”, who? “Call me Nujabes”
“Looking for a rapper for my beats
Thinking you the best choice from the UK
Do you have an email?
I’mma send a couple of my beats and some details
Want you here in Tokyo
Get you in the studio
Got you on the airfare”, bank wire sent the doe
June 10th, 1999 at the airport
First time to Japan so I had to clear my thoughts
Ready for the lyrical assault
That’s when I get the beat from Nujabes for “Don’t Even Try It”
Plus four more, we record three in a day
“Unstoppable”, plus the track “People Don’t stray”
Me and L Universe spitting on an unreleased
Part one done, Nujabes San, rest in peace

[Scratch Hook]
Big up my man Nujabes [x4]
[he make the beat knock]
Big up-big up my man Nujabes

[Verse Two]
June 23rd, 2000 and I’m back on Japanese ground
Five more tracks, “Not Yet Known”, “Slow Down”
Plus a few more, now I’m at the Guinness record store
Nujabes got more breaks than I ever saw
Said he ordered just a few of Jay-Z’s “Hard Knock”
But so much of mine and he so loved Starbucks
Then we both went on tour, Yellow in Tokyo
Fukuoka, Wakayama and Sapporo
Club I to I in Osaka and Kyoto
Gifu, Mito, Nagoya it was so dope
Then he came to London and I showed him all my best breaks
Chilling in the restaurant, eating up the best steak
Then I said goodbye at the terminal at Heathrow
He was enigmatic so incognito
He was my people, chilling in the Far East
Part two done, Nujabes San, rest in peace

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
August 14th, 15th, 2010, club unit
Hydeout, Nujabes tribute we doing it
Cise Star, Fat Jon, Pace Rock, Funk D
Emancipator, Substantial, Apani
Got to give a shout to my main man Takumi
Seiji, Segawa, the show really moved me
Moved us, Nujabes loved and respected
So many people’s lives were affected by his music
One in a million
Worldwide fans, grown men, young children
Spread the word let the whole movement increase
Part three done, Nujabes San, rest in peace

122,21122,GoodEnough,blackwave.,"[Chorus: Wesley Franklin]
Why your chain don't shine like the rapper’s do?
Why you don't bleed for your city?
Tell me what's your appeal
Prove that you real
Better have 5 killers on you
Based on the game and the things we know
Most live a lie for sure
If I let you say what’s good
Guess I ain't good enough

[Verse 1: jay.]
Those cassettes out the attic, unraveled foreign magic
Made me check the mathematics, sense the havoc
Had me skipping class to study flows
Put it in to practice, run the show
Every minute, every second, headphones stuck onto the globe
Yet it go, ""why ain't you hood? yeah, why ain't you hood?
Why ain't you rapping like you ain't understood?
Drugs, sex and violence, all left in silence
You ain't hear the shots, getting chased by the sirens, tell me""

Why your chain don't shine like the rapper’s do?

Am I supposed to run the street, my block, am I supposed to bleed
To mould my life in bars and exhibit them at your feet
My boss's dirt swept shoes, I need those too, I'm close to match the cost
Money trees in growth but patience nearly done been lost
I know we dropped what we had cause I ain't make that paper like them rappers do
Hard but bitter truth but all y'all want the sweetest juice
Presented, wrapped in gift wrap, sit back and get clapped
Chit chat, and finally shut your trap once you can see that
Chain 'round my neck, uh, diamonds in my rings, ye
Showing off my stacks, screaming fuck all o' y'all opinions
""Nice, let's televise his world and it's demise"" (Huh?)
That's all that you desire, entertainment in your eyes
Ain't that right?

[Chorus: Wesley Franklin]
Why your chain don't shine like the rapper's do?
Why you don't bleed for your city?
Tell me what's your appeal
Prove that you real
Better have 5 killers on you
Based on the game and the things we know
Most live a lie for sure
If I let you say what's good
Guess I ain't good enough

Ain't I, good enough for you
Ain't I, good enough for you

Lets not forget the vital facts, my touch is like a spinal tap
I got the character and presence that your idols lack
Smell you coming from a mile away cause you're a fake
Welcome to the city that can't sleep, cause what it sees when its awake
Under attack i got the cannon, crumble and crack, you rock a handgun
Stumbling back, you start to panic, i bring out the facts, you're propaganda
Blueprints, mental architectures hard to match
A city of thoughts put my state of mind on map
I'm having robot dreams on what it feels like to be human
B-1 double 6 E-R, watch me start the revolution
Feel a harpoon to your heart, smart move to get lost
In a dark room when it costs, your life
Yeah it's difficult, whenever i bring out my temper
You got a spotless mind, but your sun won't shine forever
It's typical, yeah, bring out my temper
I got a spotless mind, and my sun will shine forever

What a predicament, in slides the villainous character
Sly tongue, that got the audience listening
At the top of my game like, sniper position
Out of your jurisdiction if you're testing my condition
So, keep your distance, too fly to stick with
One style for too long, so long, I'm lifted
'Top the clouds the world looks so different
A city grid filled up with traveling insects
What an existence of handling business
Get manhandled on trips, if you're looking suspicious
If ya, fit the description, you fit in a 6 by 10 cell
Hell yeah that shit is sadistic
I hang with misfits, scholars, and mystics
That can see the shot coming 'for the bullets released
Got their ear to the street, like they sleeping on newsprint
Bring life to the beats, puppeteering the music
With so many lies, yo the truth is elusive
That's why we keep moving as we fly through the cumulus clouds
And that how we keep our neck out of nooses
That's why, we stay fly

Let me kill it one time
My nigga saved me from the evil side
He was like Coops you know you're the truth
And I was like oh yeah brother that's right
I almost I forgot it, No money in my pocket
Got me feeling like a prophet
My shit ain't sold, they lost their soul
Cos the devil come around I want to cop it stop it
That's why you gotta free your mind
It's for your own good, you should feel inclined
Don't want to read then pree them signs

Fuck Niggas if they don’t want to redefine, pay that price read that fine
I got to make it, cause I know I’m nothing like all of them niggas who feel like they got fake it
I innovate it, on another level I’m in a spaceship
Your shit is basic
My shit is wavy your shit is wasted
Niggas need more then a mirror to face it
Chicks need more then one lick to taste it
I just take a hit on the spliff and embrace it
Pour it in my cup, but I got nothing to case it
Now I’m feeling fucked gonna get on my cray shit
Now I’m feeling fucked Kanye and Jay shit
I watched that throne, then I got back rolled a big fat cone
Don’t let me get in my zone, remember that God made me in his clone
So I could do this whole fucking thing on my own
I could do this whole fucking thing on my own
But it ain't no fun if my real niggas can’t get some so I ain’t trying to do this alone
Peace

Where’s my sheets I’m trying to roll one up
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Tell the Feds that we don’t give a fuck
They tryna lock us up, for what?
But I won’t let it get me down
Smoke weed let it free my mind
I’m just stuck in the system trying to get out
Oh Oh Oh Oh
So come on following me on this Odyssey

(Verse 2: Elz)
I’m lost trying to find my way
Pure soul with his mind in a maze
When I find myself I'm gonna fight this hell
Gonna fight through the dark till I see brighter days
If the word wasn't giving me the time of day
Let me think about it, would I sell my soul
???
He's planning the birth of a beast
So I'm figuring ways to abort it
Till I gotta move to precaution
Cause this life will catch you out
One minute you're on top on the world
Next minute your crashing down
Now you gotta go and short your plans around
Really I just want to sort my family out, be the man of the house
Fuck the government and them shitty hand me downs
I was built for this shit
Let my soul get lifted as I smoke on this spliff
I'm doing something wrong I don't know what it is
When I'm looking in the mirror I don't know who it is
Life a bitch, ain't even got her clit wet
Time spent trying to get a spliff and get spend
If it stays like this I will probably go mental
So I change ??? so it makes sense
I'm a define my own limits, if I bring ???
Combing weed and the mind it's like spinach
??? weighing on your brain, did you get it
I'ain't praying for fame when I get in
I'm just praying for change when I get in
I'ain't praying for fame when I get in
I'm just praying for change when I get in
(yeah)

(Chorus)
Where’s my sheets I’m trying to roll one up
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Tell the FEDs that we don’t give a fuck
They trying to lock us up, for what?
But I won’t let it get me down
Smoke weed let it free my mind
I’m just stuck in the system trying to get out
Oh Oh Oh Oh
So come on following me on this Odyssey
"
126,21140,Nobody's Perfect,Anti Lilly,"[Verse 1]
Yeah
Back to the basics
Feeling like I can't get out of my own goddamn way
Feeling like I'mma be alright if I just take things one day at a time
Feeling like I'm wasting all of mines and falling out my prime
Feel like people just don't feel me no more
Feel like I done lost more than I can gain
And things just don't feel the same
I play the game, I been losing
I'm on the edge, holding loosely like a leaf that flew and landed in the rain
Inner peace just ain't enough, I need the whole thing
Most days I ain't even got in my conscience
Bout figured out how to cope without having hope for tomorrow
Can't even look in the mirror when I'm swimming in sorrow
Living hollow, can't even tell you who the hell I am
When I follow these feelings they got me feeling so alone
That I done cut off my niggas, don't wanna deal with the fam
I can't talk to my girl, that shit kill me
To watch her tears just fill as I say don't worry
Shit, you could feel the pain through the horns
Something like the seasons, it be here and it be gone
Sister told me she listened to that, I told the storm
When she going through her days and pops told me that's just the norm
I ain't making excuses, I know I gotta do this shit
Life is a reminder that we all be going through some shit
Told my brother Phoniks that I need some help to get through this shit
So in conclusion, I gotta keep moving

[Chorus]
'Cause we all works in progress
Nobody's perfect
I tell you I'm a work in progress
'Cause I ain't perfect
Ain't nobody got the answers so I question so much shit everyday
I was taught right from wrong but still it's hard to obey
'Cause I ain't perfect
Nobody's perfect

[Verse 2]
I don't hold no hatred for anybody who played me
I ain't got no feelings for women I made mistakes with
One of my exes and old friends done had a baby
Crazy how life can put people in different places
It's never how you think, it's all about how you embrace it
Back in the day, knew was the one I'd spend my days with
Back in the day, knew you was my nigga, defended you
Thought it was till infinity, but it all had a limit
Everything considered, I hope the best of y'all for the rest of your days
Hope that y'all know more sweet than bitter
Y'all teach 'lil man to make his life so much bigger than ours ever was
True shit, it don't get any realer
Me, I'm just a sinner with newer problems
The ones in the past done passed me up so I dropped em regret done fell out my pocket
It ain't all good, but it's all good
You ask me how I am, I just say I'm a work in progress

[Chorus]
'Cause we all works in progress
Nobody's perfect
I tell you I'm a work in progress
'Cause I ain't perfect
Ain't nobody got the answers so I question so much shit everyday
I was taught right from wrong but still it's hard to obey
'Cause I ain't perfect
Nobody's perfect
Nobody perfect
Never been perfect

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it take
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
Can't stop, then you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Verse 1]
Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on, needin' it all right now, when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong, whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on yo' door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain how I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free yo' mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size, yeah
See the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I fit you, blow the whistle when you run out of time, yeah
Wakin' up, I open up my eyes
Do you mind if I blow yo' mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
All the lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delayed, but I came and you cool wit' it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

128,21112,Damselfly,Loyle Carner,"[Verse 1: Loyle Carner]
It's been a minute since I've been with some women
Not 'cause they been lacking, just I've been lacking the feeling
I've been staring at the ceiling
Listening to the chat that they're revealing
Wondering if I open up or keep concealing
I ain't try to be demeaning, it seems
Thought you knew this, I don't really do this
Moving like a Judas
Talking all that talk but ain't no time for acting foolish
When you ask, all of the brothers saying, ""True, this""
I might just jump on this for free, jumpin' on them freestyle
I've been well, moving brain, senile
It's sole sunsets, beautiful is one guess
One morning afternoon in that sun dress
The summer flies by every morning, I'm still yawning
Same conversation, never boring
(""Yo, she texted you."" ""Swear?"" ""Nah, it's Tommo.""
""Ah, for fuck's sake!"")

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that these days are feeling cold
My love could take her home
As if we never knew
I was too young for you

[Verse 2: Loyle Carner]
Ay, and then you say you ain't about guys
Ay, especially brothers from the south side
But been about mine ever since the drought now
You and me been living on this cloud nine
Saying it's about time, stunting, front like
Nothing will change until it drains, ain't nothing the same, uh
'Cause you become like the blood in my veins
Saying I'm way too young to be stuck on the rain
And still it's peak weeks 'til I figured out you played keys
Eighteen, you been listening to Jay Dee
Blaming the bait trees, telling me you hate these G's
But didn't need me telling you they ain't me
Because they ain't me, uh, they ain't me
Don't need to know about the colours that they paint me
I've been too busy getting dizzy off that JD
Dreaming of the places you could take me, so now I'm saying

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that these days are feeling cold
My love could take her home
As if we never knew
I was too young for you

Super psycho two tone like vitiligo centre eye glow like ...

Lightning cat rap badder than most
Spit another flow nah I’m on a roll

[Verse 1]

When I walked up all you caught was the shade of my hat on my face
My ways are in pain, from the strain of my ways
Chains engraved in my physical days, in physical waves
I get physical strength from my individual ways
Meanwhile I'm not fulfilled, this feeling shall not be stilled
Rewind time and rewrite lines for the kinds of you to feel
Docile if you so will, fragile and you go downhill
Drinking wine, forgetting time, now time to be refilled
They say if you snooze you loose
Well I spend my days, dazed and confused
Is it cause I blaze all day and fade, then that's old news
If it's new to you, this is Yarah rapping the blues
Don't get used to it, running mascara I refuse
Closed doors prevent outsiders from viewing
But struggling alone makes it tough for pursuing
Dreams, but it seems all I get are sleepless nights
Nightmares about losing loved ones and losing fights

[Hook]
The bluebird flew over the fields of sorrow
As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow
Many will fall, a lot more will follow

[Miriam Makeba]
You take drugs to psyche your mind
You take wine, to forget about time
You create a world of your own
Where the truth, will never be known

[Verse 2]
I work when the work seems like play
And hate to play when the work seems to work my way, I say
I work my way through everyday that I play my way
Now..
Hear what I say, hear what I say
Makes it all seem hopeless like impending cancellations
The locks will open someday continued determination
Restless infection destroys spiritual vaccinations
And I will head for my destination
I stand alone at the crossroads of death inhale the breath
Of lost souls that left in and out of consciousness
Drinking wine reminds me of what honest is
Making me wonder where the hell the logic is?
We're all lost, we're all tossed, at a lost cause
Fight between ourselves, relieve ourselves, and then we all fall
Through the wall, through it all, who we are?
No denying that at 5 foot I still stand tall

[Hook]
The bluebird flew over the fields of sorrow
As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow
Many will fall, a lot more will follow

[Miriam Makeba]
You take drugs to psyche your mind
You take wine, to forget about time
You create a world of your own
Where the truth, will never be known

[Hook]x4
The bluebird flew over the fields of sorrow
As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow
Many will fall, a lot more will follow

The bluebird flew over the fields of sorrow
As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow
Many will fall, a lot more will follow

The bluebird flew over the fields of sorrow
As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow
Many will fall, a lot more will follow

The bluebird flew over the fields of sorrow
As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow
Many will fall, a lot more will follow

Many will fall
A lot more will follow
Follow

Many will fall
A lot more will follow
Follow

Many will fall
A lot more will follow
Follow

Many will fall
A lot more will follow

Yo, it be the funny brother
With the fattest of flows
Connect, slick back your neck
Slack, rock off your dome
It's poppin' off a lot, riddim'll
Get diminishing more off the top
Molotov effect as
I elect the next interject
Get into it, fill 'em up
With words, emerge victory
Turn 'em into something, frontin'
Like a don, literally
Causing me to piss myself
Viciously from laughter
After must award
These actors with a BAFTA
Fully on form
We warn you step lightly
Wreck mic with passion
Rivalling Aphrodite
It's the core rhyme scheme
Believe, we seek knowledge
More horrid when we enter and
Revent, pent up energy relent
Lend it here and we will
Show you what the real is
No pretend, real music we defend
Truth is, but that's a friend, trust
Truth is, but that's a friend
Believe

This one's done got me thinkin'
Tick tock, I'm over low flows to go
See it's much more than just for listening
Sound expand and opens soul
See some heads still got it twisted
That's why good vibes no longer show
Only going on, showing off, they witness
We bring the sweet sound, rock the show

[Interlude]

[Part II]
Now more than ever
I'm in it for the music
Sound checker, check the sound
That's how we keep it lucid
The round ready, wreck a town
Steady with the moving
Lounge heavy headed now
Bevvy n' the zoot spin
Two, two, check, mic
Too gone to do this
Too much to stop
Rock the room when I prove it
Whole crowds lovin' it
Bubbling like soup in a pot
We keep it moving whether
You're moving or not
Still killin' the riddim as if I've been given a gift
Pen, pad, scribble scribble scrunch paper in the bin
More soul, write crazy
Crowd syncopated, isn't this a given when I'm on it
Bunnin' 'em with nothin' but sound
Reach out, yeah we surfacing
Certainly heard of him
The verse alone with leave him purple
We verbally hurtling across
Dimensions, journey ending with a
Pencil and a will to go on
Ticking over to the future beyond

This one's done got me thinkin'
Tick tock, I'm over low flows to go

Well, wish I could be off but, you know... Been sitting here for like... Over four minutes now

[Hook]
Hello, Jubilee Line
How's your day? You're ruining mine
I thought you were a newer design
Couple stops back, you were just fine

So fix up, if you wouldn't mind
I mean, if you wouldn't mind

[Verse 1]
There's a party and my friends wanna go
They all know I'm never involved
They all think I'm negative though
But if I come, you'd wish you'd left me at home
I'm cool, I just can't take people that shout
Like what you screaming about?
You're holding hands, do you need to be loud?
See, this is why I hate leaving the house
I'm on the train now and this is what I'm talking about
This old man is snoring of course
And now, I bet he's dreaming of a mortgage, no doubt
Or talking to his ex wife, sorting things out
Either way I'll leave him to sleep
Got places to go, but its people I'll see
Look, I wouldn't be feeling this low
But bill collectors, they won't leave me alone
They want a fee, that ain't feasible though
Can't you see that I'm broke?
It's hard to breathe 'cause my bank account's revolting
We need to revoke
I hate the government, I needed to vote
But that's the least of my woes
I'm overworked and underpaid
Recently it's been worse and I'm afraid
I might go berserk and run away
With this girl on the Jubilee Line
I'm feeling like we're two of a kind
I was looking into your eyes and you were in mine
I ain't the intuitive kind
So speak up, if you wouldn't mind
I mean, if you wouldn't mind

[Verse 2]
Good morning grey sky
Good morning says I
Should yawning mean my day is boring?
Could falling in line make clear my calling in time?
Is my portion supposed to be awesome?
Or should I just settle for sort of sublime?
It seems I'm caught in the limelight
When all I want is to be courting a wife, right?
Nah man! I'm too young to marry
Too much to do still, and too old to hang out with Tom, Dick, or Harry
I got sick of the toxic spew
Coming from the mouth of every hot chick I've got into
So I've started answering to Todd, Jack, or Larry
And now I don't go out so much
I stay home, you could say I'm out of touch
And when my friends say, ""have you heard that new album? The one by such and such?""
I'm like, who?
And who are you?
I've haven't had friends for months
I mean, I do have friends
They just forgot my name and never come to the ends
See, they don't like the train or the track
So now I sit alone and pretend
That I ever get the Jubilee Line
See, I don't see her much of the time
I tend to favour Victoria's vibe
As if I go out
I usually decline

I'll stay home, if you wouldn't mind
I mean, if you wouldn't mind

Alone in my daddy house, nothing there to eat

Hi, how're you doing?
Just a, ah... big breakfast and a large black coffee, thanks
Cheers
I love you

[Chorus]
And there's a place I go for breakfast every afternoon
The coffee's rubbish and the bacon's always hard to chew
And the toast is always soggy
But I hardly notice
And the food takes such a long time to get made
Even when I'm the only person in the café
And my table's always wobbly
But I hardly notice (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
You're probably thinkin', why would I even bother
Eatin' there on a daily basis, there's heaps of other places on offer
Why not change to another place if the bacon is rubber
And the taste of the cuppa makes you pull faces and splutter?
It's the waitress, I love her, way she clears plates with a clutter
Makes my heart race and it flutters, I know it's crazy to love a
Lady that's basically just a
Stranger with an apron down her, brother, I don't need to ask her name and number

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause this relationship
Is built on breakfast
I'm waiting on her just to wait on me

And there's a place I go for breakfast every afternoon
The coffee's rubbish and the bacon's always hard to chew
And the toast is always soggy
But I hardly notice
And the food takes such a long time to get made
Even when I'm the only person in the café
And my table's always wobbly
But I hardly notice

[Verse 2]
She says ""Hi"" to me, ""Bye"" to me, ""That'll be $5.95"" to me
I don't really mind, that's all right with me
I just smile and eat, sometimes we mightn't speak for like a week
She knows during my quiet times, I like to be alone
And write a poem with my headphones
Newspaper, bacon fried up, poached egg, slice of toast
A long black, but the beans are always burnt
And if the cup is dirty, she just cleans it with her shirt
I wonder if she's my ideal girl
And what would happen if we dated in the real world
Nah, I don't think it would work
I wouldn't wanna risk what we have and have to tip 'cause of that, besides

[Pre-Chorus]
This relationship
Is built on breakfast
I'm waiting on her just to wait on me
(Yeah)

And there's a place I go for breakfast every afternoon
The coffee's rubbish and the bacon's always hard to chew
And the toast is always soggy
But I hardly notice
And the food takes such a long time to get made
Even when I'm the only person in the café
And my table's always wobbly (Yeah)
But I hardly notice

[Bridge]
And it don't matter that the bacon I eat's cold
And it's okay the newspapers are weeks old
But I don't mind, no, it's fine 'cause she's all
That (That) I'm (I'm) there (There) for
And it don't matter that the bacon I eat's cold
And it's okay the newspapers are weeks old
But I don't mind, no, it's fine 'cause she's all
That (That) I'm (I'm) there (There) for

[Chorus: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

[Verse 3: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I want to get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than Funkadelic wearing Pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparing answers
Sharing transcripts, while we over here
Dipping and dancing, rhythm romancing
Wallflowers, giving no action, no
All hours we chillin' and maxin'
So relaxin', opposites attractin'
I'ma toss my hat in, floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack bend, jigglin' and wigglin'
Freaking booties, speaking to the cuties so belligerent
No religion, just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn, negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it responds

[Chorus: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

(Who, Who, Who?)
Who got the keys to this bimma, bimma
Hold up, nigga ain’t nobody got a bimma
Got a bimma til’ sim simma come and get ya, hit ya
Trust me, ain’t no need to worry
Imagination from the dome made me
Get it, hit it, ya feel it, see, now we got a whip
Armored like a tank, got the tank fully filled
(damn!) fueled with a residue that got you going
Zero to a hundred, nigga real quick, real shit
Oh man I swear, even got the rims
Upped with the signs like a Pimp
And if I come to think of it, I even had a mistress
Pourin’ up the drank that I drank
While I sang, with the boys
Right behind us in a royce
Steady stunting to this joint, ay ay
Catch me drifting in your lane
Come through, with the crew
You better stay out the way-ay-ay
Cause I heard it’s the word round town
That jay, me, killing goofy niggas real quick right now
Ego-tripping intermission on this mission Imma sin
Asking if I’d do it again, all over from the start to the end
Til’ I got it all figured out and then I’m out

[Pre-Chorus]
Just gotta make it drip, drip, drip, drip
City on the map and the whole clique sip, sip, sip, sip
Swangin', tweaking in the whip
Swangin', treat you with a trick (Ay!)
Make it drip, drip, drip, drip
City on the map and the whole clique sip, sip, sip, sip
Swangin', tweaking in the whip
Swangin', treat you with a trick

Whooh, damn, let me swang
You just gotta let me do my thang, thang

You just gotta let me do my thang, thang

Just, gotta let me do my thang, thang

Just, gotta let me do my thang

[Verse 2: will.]
(Hold up)
Labels pushing us like white
Call it dope music
They be asking us why? (Why?)
Cause we on that whole new shit
I'm not a dealer but I move units
On the run
I ain’t got a gun but I shoot movies
Just for fun
Yeah we be bumping this shit in the whip
Motherfucker we be cruising
Y’all might be deaf man
If you don’t think its a Def Jam Rick Rubin
Solving the game like a Rubik
Reinvent it like a cubist
I feel like Pablo like a pyro
We ain’t cooling down
Up in space like I’m Kubrick
Overseas like odyssey
It's Ludacris how we move bitch
Get out the way
Swerve so hard now we swangin’ in space
Get out the way
Swerve so hard now we swangin’ in space

137,21116,You Dont Need Me,Granata,"[Verse 1]
Watch out for people who call shot gun
Chances are they're not fun
I haven’t put out my album yet but it got done
I’m too busy traveling the country in a datsun

I went back to a flip phone
Most of the time it's just sitting by my hip bone
'Cause I don’t need that shit
I just wanna a pretty junky I could relapse with

So I could stare at her eyes
Feelin' like i’m sittin' in a chair in the sky
I love playing with her hair when I’m high
I’ll take forbidden fruit any day over american pie

When real life hits her up she don’t care to reply
I’m the same way you’ll never see me wearing a tie
I’d share a casket with you if we were buried alive
Me and her playing truth or dare til we die

[Hook]
You don’t need me, you don’t need me
And I don’t think I need you
But if it works than we shouldn't need to
You don’t need me, you don’t need me
And I don’t think I need you
But if it works than we shouldn't need to

Pessimist people are pesticides
Let em cry, they need to be left to dry
The truth might hurts but living on the internet’s a lie
I can’t say it enough... get outside

The dome is always better whenever she keeps her head up high
I hear her pussy purr when I pet her thighs
She let me get away with it 'cause I said it sly
If I’m the last Granata I’ll rack up a lotta debt and die

Wake up have a waffle and a beer
Pour it in a mason jar and keep the bottle for my tears
My mother took the blame, my father took the fears
Don’t be a drain be a faucet for the peers

How do you find yourself if your lost in a career
Feel like i’m selling out when i auction off my ear
I can’t handle getting caught up in the small talk
I’m hanging up i’ll just act like the call dropped

[Hook]
You don’t need me, you don’t need me
And I don’t think I need you
But if it works than we shouldn't need to
You don’t need me, you don’t need me
And I don’t think I need you
But if it works than we shouldn't need to

I’m at the diner late night eating french toast
I guess I obtained some bloodstains on my trench coat
Chain smoked a pack of cigs woke up with some strep throat
Dragging my feat on the street while my head floats

There's heaven there's hell then there's vaudeville
I listen to Bill Burr, Bukowski and Bob Dyl
Smoke til I choke, blow coke and pops pills
No need to reprimand me because I’m sure god will

In the wintertime the taverns a hot commodity
I like that it's got camaraderie
Gettin' lost in the frost of a cold mug
We all hate our jobs and wish that we sold drugs

I'm hiding in a hole in the wall
I’m not a solider at all, merely a shoulder for y’all
A canvas for you to cry on
What good is pullin' strings in a world made of nylon?

[Hook]
You don’t need me, you don’t need me
And I don’t think I need you
But if it works than we shouldn't need to
You don’t need me, you don’t need me
And I don’t think I need you
But if it works than we shouldn't need to

I don't think I need you
I don't think I need you
I don't think I need you
I don't think I need you

138,21127,Change,J. Cole,"[Intro: J. Cole, Ari Lennox, & J. Cole & Ari Lennox]
Boy, ooh
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah (Mmm, mmm)
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: J. Cole, Ari Lennox, & J. Cole & Ari Lennox]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate (Mmm)
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see, I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath (Mmm)
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step (Mmm)
As we speak, I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness got 'em overwhelmed
(Mmm, ""Please, God, I want to go to Heaven"")
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail (Mmm)
See, I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand (Mmm)
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife  (Mmm), like

[Chorus: J. Cole, J. Cole & Ari Lennox, & Ari Lennox]
I know you desperate for a change, let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from— (Ooh)
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from— (Ooh, oh, woah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole & Ari Lennox]
Yeah, my
Chosen religion, Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions (Mmm)
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard  (Mmm)
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates (Mmm)
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel, 'cause I'm supposed to have a halo (Mmm)
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly (Mmm)
Fiends wan' get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do? I just supply
It's economics, my business ain't got the suit and tie (Oh, wait)
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine (Oh, wait)
I can't oblige, dawg, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga, huh (Mmm)

[Chorus: J. Cole, J. Cole & Ari Lennox, & Ari Lennox]
I know you desperate for a change, let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from— (Oh, hey)
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from the inside)
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from— (Yeah)

[Verse 3: J. Cole & Ari Lennox]
Prodigal son, got a new gun, this one
Don't run out of ammo, lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain myself? (Myself)
If I fall, dust it off and regain myself (Myself)
Fuck them all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved (Ooh)
I no longer bury demons
I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing (Ooh)

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole, J. Cole, & Ari Lennox]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more, yeah, yeah (I, I, yeah)
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little (Oh, no)
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more (Oh, oh, no)
""Time is short,"" that's what somebody told me (Told me, oh)
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Ayy, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole & Ari Lennox]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands (Ooh)
All of a sudden, niggas poppin' trunk and then we scram (Mmm)
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man (Ooh, yeah)
Eyes wide, that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills (Ooh)
Bloodshed done turned the city to a battlefield (Mmm)
I call it poison, you call it real, that's how you feel?
(Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop)

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go) Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, 'cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was twenty-two
(Last night at around 7:45) He was twenty-two
(Twenty-two year old black male, suspect, reporting on the news)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh, no)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr. (No)
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro)
We got to do better, people
Twenty-two years old, this boy was too young (Oh my God)
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentlemen
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words (I'ma kill them niggas)
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—
"
139,21141,You Know I'm No Good,Amy Winehouse,"[Verse 1]
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 2]
Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinkin' on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet ya, chips and pita
You say, ""When we married""
'Cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first?

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no good

143,21164,Let Nas Down,J. Cole,"[Produced by J. Cole]

[Intro: J. Cole & Nas]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born, same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'da thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play and
I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, soundin' sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, ""You the one, yo, why you make that shit?""
[Chorus: J. Cole]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made ""You Owe Me"", dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par when I followed my heart?
Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind that kept on sayin', ""Where's the hits? You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none,""
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcomes, huh
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, studied they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game
[Chorus: J. Cole]
But on the way I let Nas down
Damn, I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open the door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it?

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Letting Nas down
I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Story begin

And you're by my side, I'm so glad
Come to the club so I can see your bright eyes
Keep dancing, no time for cries
Just wanna have fun as mornings rise
It's time for summer skies

148,21166,Sketches of Pain,Audible Mainframe,"Intro

They say, or at least they say that they say
That reality is only what your mind chooses to believe
If that’s true, believe this

[Hook 1]
I don’t rap, I talk rhythm into a mic
I try to enlight and let my soul take flight
I can’t describe it, cause it’s more like a feeling
To grab a mic and touch every soul up in the building
To fill a room with love from the floor to the ceiling
Where ain’t nobody shooting and there ain’t nobody killing
I can’t describe it but you feel it in the air
It’s the thump of the base, it’s the snap of the snare
I can’t describe it cause it’s more like a feeling
A future with me and no mics, I don’t see it
It’s hip hop and this is all that I know
I plug the mic into the speaker give these people a show

[Hook 2]

It seems these days everybody is a scholar
Not because they love knowledge because they love dollars
I feel bad for those who live and die for their possessions
Know nothing, know it all answering the wrong questions
Like this, dude I know at university school
Works hard gets A’s but the boy is a fool
He doesn’t get people, he’s uncomfortable around them
Couldn’t find a square hole, so he tried to fit in a round one
Bad move, but the boy stays patient
It ain’t about education college is a corporation
So when I don’t feel like dealing with the world that surrounds me
My Radiohead video tech bumps loudly
And proudly without giving a blink
Shit, my life is too short to care about what you think
I just open my brain, drip ink like rain
And I sit down describing these sketches of pain

[Hook 3]

Sometimes I feel my life is just one long day
Like I’m on the right track but I’m riding wrong train
What does the song say, and they scream to the youth
Get up, stand up you know it’s the truth
All day Leon Trotskis preach revolution
Waiting for singers and rappers to offer a solution
It can weep for you, it can grieve for you
It can open your eyes, but it can’t see for you
It’s just music and it won’t change the world
People got to do it, every boy every girl
Fuck Darwin, we got to carry one another
Every woman is your sister, every man is your brother
The day we the people decide to stand united
There ain’t a government in the world that can fight it
The day we the people decide to stand united
There ain’t a bloody army in the world that can fight it

And you know this, man
"
149,21168,Life in the Balance,The Four Owls,"[Intro]
Like a leaf clings to a tree

[Verse 1: Leaf Dog]
The world is well balanced like karma is
Do you find freedom on the front line where the army is
Or in your mind opening the left part of this
I feel it in-between my bones just like the cartilage
When I'm parting this world I won't be sad
The true gift was the blessing of life that I've had
You can think that I'm mad, Ol' Leaf's on some hippy shit
It took a lot of changes in me to consider it
Inspired by an old ancient manuscript
The Mayans did predict
But can you handle it
It's a sign of the times that's hidden in the lines
The description is what the indigenous define
Assure as the sun won't shine, and the rain falling
The balance is untold in this life we all in
On this misty morning, I zone, at one
With the things that molded how I've grown

[Verse 2: BVA MC]
Looking at the bigger picture
There'll always be people like Hitler
And balancing it out
Mother Teresa tryna fix the world
Then Ghandi making sure the scales don't tip turn
That darker side but thats just the mix in life's elixir
Without bad theres no good, without wood theres no fire
Without the hood the posh house price wouldn't be higher
No stronger no weaker, no stupid no deeper
No dick dropping rubbish theres no work for street sweepers
Without life there'd be no death
And that I don't stop the pain
Just concentrate on the memories they left
When I'm looking at the stars I realise
I'm just a speck on the Earth's surface
I measure my worth by my intellect
We've all got a purpose, some people got three
Some people fall in line and others have got dreams
We all do our best with the tools we were given
Shit my hammer and chisel is this life that I'm living'

[Hook x2: Verb T]
Life in the balance, scales of justice
Reach for answers, but failed to touch it
My mind lost in this, defined by my opposite
Life in the balance, rise to the challenge

[Verse 3: Verb T]
Eight steps away
In fact flip that eight on its side
Because now I infinitely chase
For that intimate embrace with lady luck
I mean fuck, how long can someone stay in a rut?
I'm like 'no'
You see thats all on me, to re-evaluate my goal
And forget the greed, but sometimes I think
Do I know myself? And if not
Is that why I can't control myself?
I got a family man I should be responsible
Same time mind states held in that constant ball
That's why my girls so stressed hey
'Cos I get under your skin like an X-Ray
But lets pray that it change for the best
Deep breath to the chest, now I'm ready for the next day
Your in life with the next brain
Tryna be the opposite like a sex change
Focus head space

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Fliptrix]
Its like I'm standin' on the moon staring at the world
Tryna work out the balance of this life we hold
It's all a mystery encrypted in the Mayan scrolls
The cycle of the fifth sun is coming to a close
2012 will only truly show us what that holds
The plot thickens as I stand here to break the mold
Got my hands out, tryin' not to feel the cold
But some people walkin' by are fueled with an icy soul
Tools by they side, they take your life for your frigging phone
Others feel helpless, the selfless give a child a home
Rich feed the rich while the others just apply for loans
Money buys everything, but love that's the finest gold
I gotta live fast and won't be dying barely old
Hedonistic lifestyles reflect how our lives unfold
Life is one big cycle like the vinyl spinnin' round it goes
And it goes

[Verse 5: Jam Baxter]
Equilibrium
See a billion desperate parts conjoined and deified brilliance
Grand amphibians, submerged in slime
Emerging like blood when blunt words collide
The sun burnt his eyes, the ice sliced his feet to bits
But you ain't gotta teach it shit
'Cos the change is instinctual, the pace is unthinkable
But never put your faith in a fake individual
Balance
From the fangs and the mandibles and talons
To mannicles and batons to cannons
To mechanical contraptions, fashioned out of passion
That could turn the Earth back to a burnt black chasm
Shit happens
Atoms, bound by compassion
To fractal patterns I saw spinning
In the caverns of my mind once, it all ties up
If I could see a bright sky shine when my eyes shut

150,21165,Never Stop Loving You Ft. Terrace Martin & Talib Kweli,9th Wonder,"[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Intro: Terrace Martin]
Never stop loving you, hehe!
Ey, what's happenin y'all? Yeah
It's Terrace Martin and my homeboy, 9th Wonder
Brought to you live from Devi Terrace Tuesdays

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Yeah, you
Excuse me Miss Lovable, I don't mean to trouble you
Your bubble's so beautiful, got it from your mother too
That night at The W, Ball when I discover you
Made me wanna fix all your problems, now let me troubleshoot
In all actuality, your mentality dwarfed your attributes
Personality as sweet as passion fruit
Conversation casual but quickly turn to marital
I am hip-hop but I'm not your average rapper dude
There's more to me, I never call you shorty cause there's more to you
You priceless, them other chicks affordable
I'm callin you adorable, every chance I get in the recordin booth
In bed, barely audible, you wonder who I'm talkin to
Heh.. We whisperin the sweet nothings
Back when I was single, I had the streets buzzing
Now I need you to complete my album
Cause you my partner and it's hard for me to be without you

[Hook]
Never stop loving you (Uh, never stop, never stop)
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop, never gonna
I'll never stop, never stop, no!

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
I had a dream that you would come and you'd complete my life
Back when I was younger, I would wonder if I need a wife
Mentally recorded as important what I need to say
And back in the days with CDs and cassettes made by TDK
The vinyl was spinnin, you was winnin with the 8-track
Ya momma had a Dodge Dart, way before the Maybachs
And the Mercedes golf cart, I gamble like a card shark
Hit her with the wizardry, defense against the dark arts
Wrote a song about it, wanna hear it? I got a lot to say
Modify ya Spotify, play me through your Dr. Dre's
You got the juice now, fresh not from concentrate
Your embrace warmer than a goose down from Dr. Jays
The winter of my discontent, this is what you spring for
You'd wonder where the summer went, stop preparin for the fall
See it really don't matter what the season is
You like my breathing, I never leave it cause I need to live

There's a conversation going on with our brothers
We're distracted with our crimes
Speak the language of our times

Lost with converse in the game they play
Floors drop from under

We make no sound, We make no sound

He just lay there, staring up at us
The doctors told us that the chemicals might affect certain glands and nerves
And if they did his features would never be normal again...

*Scratching* I've done my best, I've racked my brain
*Scratching* Racked my *Scratching* Racked my brain
*Scratching* I've done my best, I've racked my brain

[Verse 1: Jam Baxter]
Deep aquatic excavator, dishevelled entertainer
One thousand breeds of weasel wrestle on this escalator
Tree dwellers leaping out the boughs shouting “Get the paper”
Trunk hugging rebels chucking petals at a detonator
Man this shit’s second nature
My colossal monster, fed a rich mix of tar, truth and bottled vodka
Off to clock the shrunken brains that punctuate the squalor yonder
Shotters on the underpasses passing rocks in rotten Poplar
Doctor doctor, your people never needed you
It’s deep when human evolution
Seems it’s superseded you
My super seeds will germinate and turn the greys to greens and blues
They’ll never find a pesticide to burn away the weeds that grew nah
Divine vines twists around a muddy aura
Gully author guilty is the hand that grips the bloody borer
Bloody nora shit the bed the kid’s back, bell your Mum
It seems a barrer’s work is never done – tell ‘em son

[Hook]
Can you replace a man’s brain? It seems a bit derranged
I was still a foetus when the smug salesman came
Calling out my name a stranger in the rain
Banging at the doors of all perception screaming cuz pick a
Brain frazzled brains, pickled brains, putrid brains, fickle brains
Giant brains, shrivelled brains, vile brains, crippled brains
Runny brains, yummy brains, mushy brains, get your brains
Lovely brains, steaming brains, eat your brains, buy my brains

[Verse 2: Jam Baxter]
Nice crematorium, I simply love the décor
The burning brains add a lovely sparkle to this stage floor
I guess it’s all to play for, I’ll smash it in the second leg
The jaded killer dragging seven dead sins to resurrect
And entertain for brunch inside my mind I awake again
Like, come on my trusty little sidekicks, let’s make amends
Please, I’ve got a plan for us
Hapless clammy hands erupt in every shade of perfect
Turning vermin into trampled slugs
Turning serpents into snapped elastic bands that once held a mind together
Find the bits and bind them better
Goodbye forever, wait
I think I left my keys somewhere in that reprobate’s brains
I guess I better see, hold still
Operation rummage fails at phase one
The blade swung, the kid fell, I watched it all and stayed numb
The day comes where Mister Guts McGruff needs to clock the truth
Belling up an ever eager salesman in a soggy suit

[Hook]
Replace that brain, it seems a bit deranged
See he was still a foetus when the smug salesman came
And now it ain’t the same, a stranger in the rain
Banging at the doors of all perception screaming pick a brain
Giant brains, shrivelled brains, vile brains, crippled brains
Runny brains, yummy brains, mushy brains, get your brains
Lovely brains, steaming brains, eat your brains, buy my brains

Won’t be sipping Coca Cola just sniffing the coke
Pissed in a boat, asking mystery mermaids to kiss on my throat

154,21170,Rest in Pedals,Granata,"[Intro]
Hey yo, I just wanna say shout out to my red bike, it got stolen about a year ago, and I think about you everyday
But you know, now I got a blue bike and it's not the same but it's a new life, a new journey, so.. uh.. rest in pedals red bike, I love you

[Verse 1]
I like to bask in the tropics with a flask in my pocket
If you actin all brolic I’ll start laughing and mock it
Like a charismatic parrot that is a comic
Now I’m feelin' like the shit now that I’m rappin' with Phoniks
Loose off of gin rickies, perusing Sin City
Ridin' my Schwinn smooth like the swing of Ken Griffey
And the felt of the velvet, I said hell with a helmet
I can tell that you’re jealous of the smell of the shellfish
Don’t tell me I need a haircut
You can’t walk a mile in my shoes cause I’m barefoot
Bob’s takin' a toke, God’s makin' a joke
With a mickey mantle rookie card clothes pinned in my spoke
I’m partying with the dead like dia de los muertros
People look at me funny cause I’m a scarecrow
But I don’t care bro I’m snacking on apricots (fuck off!)
I need my space like an astronaut

[Chorus]
I’m in the sun chasin' rum with the juice of a plum
In a singing mood and drinkin' booze like a bum
Someone stole my red bike so I bought a blue one
I was sad but fuck it I got a new one
Chasin' rum with the juice of a plum
In a singing mood and drinkin' booze like a bum
Someone stole my red bike so I bought a blue one
I was sad but fuck it I got a new one

[Verse 2]
I wanna live in Bolivia and be oblivious
I’m sick of always having to deal with these idiots
The ignorance is ubiquitous and its hideous
When I get lucky that's when I’m the wittiest
When people don’t leave me alone that's the shittiest
When people leave their phone at home that's the prettiest
Goin' on a hike shouldn’t be considered hippie shit
It's okay to spend some days away from your affiliates
Mother nature's where I’m plantin' my seed
Do a dance in the breeze, on a branch of a tree
I reside in my mind, that's the land of the free
I got the world in palm, you should hand it to me
I can’t copy or steal cause i got art etiquette
Sometimes I think that everyone’s my arch nemesis
I’ve come to the conclusion my bike is my best friend
And my worst enemies tend to be dead ends

[Chorus]
I’m in the sun chasin' rum with the juice of a plum
In a singing mood and drinkin' booze like a bum
Someone stole my red bike so I bought a blue one
I was sad but fuck it I got a new one
Chasin' rum with the juice of a plum
In a singing mood and drinkin' booze like a bum
Someone stole my red bike so I bought a blue one
I was sad but fuck it I got a new one

I got a new thang yeah, I hope that it’s alright with you, with you, with you
I told my girl I got a new thang, yeah, I hope that it's alright with you, with you, with you

Hey you, someone stole my red bike so I bought a blue one
If I see that fucker ridin' it then Ima sue em

Crave the high when it blows
(Hey, Hey)
Steady, missing out on shit and you can't stand it
(Day, Day)
And on and on it goes
Goes
(Day)
Goes
Living life in a flashback
You backtrack
(Day, Day)
Miss the highs and the lows
(Day, Day)
Only check the weather when your hair did, damn it
(Hey, Hey)
And its all the same thing
Barricaded in your palisades
Running out of time so you should know
Copped this one way out to Mexico
Cause you compress my soul and call it love

Luscious blonded-haired chick staring right at me
I think that she aware that I've been feeling unhappy
I'll give you my soul but don't think it'd be attractive
And honestly you blowing me away with the patterns
Winters in L.A., summer time in Manhattan
I find myself asking if I'm really that happy
Should I pack the bags up and start being average?
You give them your soul and they go put it in trash cans
We did too much acid that day back in Staten
Now every time my back bend I feel the reaction
I find myself laughing, knowing they read me backwards
Pax while I'm driving to where the gate need a password
My rich girl another beautiful disaster
She said she only chill with musicians and actors
Can tell by every Instagram photo she asks for
And how she blow a pill anytime she needs laughter
She called me a bastard
Like I ain't supposed to know she sad
I'm only entertainment, what the fuck I know bout that?
Said a killer freeze, never gonna kill again
Tell you I love you and I never wanna chill again
Still got the illest pen
Never get comfortable
Never thought my hatred could make something so lovable
But as I sip a couple couple more to cleanse my sins
Realized I'm as lonely as I've ever been

Where do I go? I got no moves left
Every direction seems so strange

Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes

[Verse 1: Elbee Thrie]
That's why I love the moon
Every night it's there for you
It's constant
Unlike these human beings
Who lie about what it seems to be
You think the Earth is where you stand
You're in the palm of someone's hand
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every night up out my window
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every single night I look outside
It's right there for me
And my mind
And that's why I love the moon, yeah
Because people can consume my love
In the wrong way
So I send it up
At night, at night, at night

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes, it blinds
So be careful where you look for love, ohh
Just be careful where you look for love, ohh
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes, it blinds us all
So be careful where you look for love-ove
Just be careful where you look for love, ohh

[Verse 2: Sheriff PJ]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, that's why I let the moon shine
('Cause through the time I've been confused on how to move on)
I'm stuck in between what wasn't and what could be the truth, ha
(Still up tryna escape the demons in my room, yo)
You see it's no change droppin' we learn to maintain profit
And how could anybody else feel pain when they brainwash us?
And watch us every time we make exchanges (We slaves)
Locked in a box, we use our mind just to escape all the same shit
I'm tired of the pain
Love is blind to the flame
That's why I look up, never hide behind sky's when it rain
Promises cooked up exercisin' through denyin' the pain
That's why I look for ways find whatever lies in the rain
'Cause shit change
I don't blame my father for lampin' I believe that helped
Went from tryna grow as your son to tryna grow as myself
So understand it when I'm stranded, takin' chances
Know I need that fall
Flat on my back, you just relax and kick your seat back, uh
'Cause when you think
That's when you let time run and escape what your mind loving
That's what you think
So what you think?
If love was easy to find, we wouldn't need it to complete our lives
So

[Outro: Elbee Thrie]
Peace to the moon
Peace to the stars
Peace to Saturn
And peace to Mars

162,21159,Equality,Afu-Ra,"[Bridge: Ky-Mani Marley]
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to say, ay
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared, now I say

[Chorus: Afu-Ra]
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it non-stop
What, I pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it non-stop

[Verse 1: Afu-Ra]
Meditation, equality, it keeps me level headed, the men-tal-ity
Cool, calm, post-hypnotic suggestion
Never stressin', heat chambers never sweatin'
Honeys cryin', cause her man she caught cheatin'
Mothers eyein', sons cut down like bushes
Daddy's sicker than the land lord, just evicted
Stressed to death, month to month until he kicked it
I seen ya hustlin' on the dark streets, the mental
Look what you been through, you just escaped reality
Now what ya into, is just a technicality
Check it, deep inside of my head like T.V
The lifestyle I live so crooked you won't believe me
Lessons learned that I could walk a tight rope
Even though I toke and choke, don't provoke
Uh, now you can call me Afu-rastahood
Cause I rob from the rich and I give to the good
Even though it's for the money B, I'm droppin' knowledge G
Straight shots to the head, peep the summary
Wake up in the mornin' got me yearnin' for food
Yeah, yeah what, huh, I'm that type of dude
Pledge allegiance, pay attention, payin' homage
So much time held in my hand, none for college (college)

[Chorus: Afu-Ra]
Hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu

[Bridge 2: Ky-Mani Marley]
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to bust
They wanna guide my medication with their crooked laws
Say I can't hold a bong and smoke, my lord
But, if it's war that they want, we are ready, are registered
The king, it is he, who defends me
So when it's time for the showdown
We're marchin', the soldiers Babylon get throwed down
When the war is over we burn up the whole town
And my spliff will stay lit from sun up to sun down
Ay, ay Afu

[Bridge 1]
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to say, ay
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared, now I say

[Verse 2: Afu-Ra]
Stimulating, verses like blood work ing
Paper hits the pen like the needle to ya skin
Blow ya blood up, Xena, hero-in
More contagious than sex (sex), nobody flex
Dangerous minds, little kids throw gang signs
Treacherous times, too many can't press rewind
Stress the elevation, wrap my thoughts like a mummy
It's funny, how sometimes some smart ones are dummies
Scorin' a million, forget the S.A.T
Now I, leap more towers than Pisa, peep the ether
Wrap it in a scroll, pass it off to Ky-Mani
Lessons of exquisiteness, verses poetry

[Bridge 1 + Chorus]
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to say, ay
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared, now I say

My car ride but I'm somber when I'm somber
Everything was simpler when I just had a Tumblr

Better keep your head up when you're going under
Do it over a show where the fuck was lumber
The hunger the hunger

167,21179,Fly with Me,Yung Bae,"[Verse 1: Bless]
I grew up thinking I was comfortable with life
Despite the brightness of my skin when I was young, I’d be alright
But dang, you’re like a timeout from reality
Tonight, feeling tears building up but still they never saw the light of day
Thinking I’m powerless; forever scarred
Forever y’all are close, but never close enough for comfort like we built a wall
I can recall you crying tears because you fell
But what’s weird, is when you stopped, you asked me if I was okay
Hali always understood me, that was years ago
Now, not a soul understands; what should I expect from peers though?
Its past true, Vale said its past due to reckon
The people you that think highly of are probably thinking less of you
Hold your confidence the way you hold on to your mom
You get your beauty from her; I hope you grow better than I did
Aaliyah means rising; growing up before my eyes
Only two and you probably know more; I’m just blinded by the dark side

[Hook: Bless]
Where am I going, there’s no where to go
Come on, flying baby; you can (fly with me)
You can (fly with me) x3

Where am I going, there's no where to go
Come on, flying baby; you can, and you can
(Fly, fly with me)

[Verse 2: Bless]
Man, I’m speechless, and broken
Someone at school said
“Look, I see that you’re focused, but why aren’t you open like the rest of us?”
I told them, you’re problems aren’t mine
So, if I follow what you say, it’s the blind leading the blind
See, here lies a teen that gets more personal with this
In which I’m spilling verses wishing it was really worth your ears
Yeah, I thought of Hali saying
“Homeboy, I feel you but if you love something too much, I guarantee it’ll kill you”
And that was true enough to strike me as a sign
It’s difficult, seeing you in pain; trying to keep your eyes open
I often wonder why I panic more than anybody
It wasn’t fear, but urgency to see you here without these – tubes in your nose
I hugged your mom because I love her just as much
But sometimes I feel as if it’s not enough
I miss you both; honestly I hope you get this letter
It’s delivered to the most beautiful mother/daughter duo ever

[Hook: Bless]
Where am I going, there's no where to go
Come on, flying baby; you can, and you can
(Fly, fly with me)

Where am I going, there’s no where to go
Come on, flying baby; you can (fly with me)
You can (fly with me) x3

Now, tell me the exact details of what you saw. Came from a plate of chemical phenomenon. Where have been sat up until now? The scientist should not talk until positive. For the times we cannot wait to be positive. From the bottom of the fake of the human race

[Verse 1]
A exotic is the tropical, storm-chasing up your optical
Audio hurricane impossible, arsonist, esophageal tonsillitis
Rhymes so sick, I give the mic meningitis
Like hemp on papyrus, you could twist this or smoke this
Bag it up cause it was dope when I wrote it
Blackmagic focus, 4K vision
Fifth dimension, fuck your high-definition
The technician of these analogue villains
Known to manifesto, magnetic, presto
Spinach with the egg white, don't forget the pesto
Lay it on ciabatta, it ain't a rapper hotter
I'm the whole enchilada, plus the chimichanga
Give me ganja, champagne, shrimp and lobster
I'm a monster, mobster, keep the party bonkers
Like Conan, I conquer, you step up, I stomp you

[Hook]
You don't want trouble with a man like me
Patch on my eye, hook where my hand should be
You don't want problems, I'm a problem-solver
They call me the problem-solver

You don't want trouble with a man like me
Patch on my eye, hook where my hand should be
You don't want problems, I'm a problem-solver
They call me the problem-solver

[Verse 2]
I could be fire to the filament, symphonies of energy
Power from the pulsars, reaching thorough infinity
Dilated pupils, preaching my curriculum
Rapid eyes move to the beat of my soliloquy
I could be the atom bomb detonating in the eve
Radiating truth and light, soaking into everything
Pushing out my particles, steam drifting in the breeze
Water for the thirsty art and for the heart to breathe
Food for a hungry mind, fire for the tumbleweeds
Love for the sacred sound, hope for a dying breed
Bouncing off the satellites, soaking truth into the seeds
I can make 'em grow, elevate to new degree
But there's a dark matter scattered over everything
Chipping at the icebergs, choking out the evergreens
We losing power, walking the final hour
Wet sands full of fresh depths left in a mystery
Somebody break the blinds, I'm waiting on the windowsill
The people never see the signs, never have, never will
No composure, they fold from exposure
The shadows where the cowards hide and shining brightest for the king

[Hook]
You don't want trouble with a man like me
Patch on my eye, hook where my hand should be
You don't want problems, I'm a problem-solver
They call me the problem-solver

You don't want trouble with a man like me
Patch on my eye, hook where my hand should be
You don't want problems, I'm a problem-solver
They call me the problem-solver

[Verse 3]
I ignite the night sky like the 4th of July
Get fried like fish talking shit, your wish to die supplied the potent
Flow is the dopest, pit bull ferocious
I stay focused, I'm the street's last poet
Conscious of the magnum opus
I'm so qualified, doubt quantified cause my ambition quantized
It's rap homicide, guardian of the galaxy
So dastardly because you bastards are wack to me
Rap is like crack to me, tracks like a pack to me
Flip it so quick, connects can't get back to me
Actually, the feds want to capture me for talking revolution
Crushing the institution with lyrical distribution
The pay is retribution, write rhymes on the constitution because I'm a nuisance, politically
Yet they acclaim me so critically, they can't stop me until they alter me chemically
That's why I wrote my own, hold the phone
Phonicks, we running, no tail chief to grab us on
While I pilot these lyrical drones to kill the clones
Fly the flag, skull and bones, with a pocket full of stones

[Hook]
You don't want trouble with a man like me
Patch on my eye, hook where my hand should be
You don't want problems, I'm a problem-solver
They call me the problem-solver

You don't want trouble with a man like me

Give up weed ever
Better bill another zoot now

Conjuring the flows
Full of prose from a smoked tree
Jeheeze

Floating on the high seas
Aligned with my rhymes schemes
Peak times round here
An O’s so pricey
But I don’t care
I take Mary out nightly
Treat her so nice
Wrap her up tightly
She’s smelling so fresh
I might make her my wifey

A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
Swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was, ""Man, I'm broke""
And now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what's gon' be

[Chorus]
(The way we are) That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are
(The way we are) I'm takin' care of each and every part
I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are, the way we are

Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, I do, I do, I remember that bitch now
Yeah, yeah, uh, tenth grade, (?) it was tenth grade
She had the fat ass with the little sweats that said ""Bad Bitch"" on the back
That's so not the case right now
Oh, no, it's okay, baby, you ain't gotta go
I'm just—I'm just keeping it real
You don't look how you used to
At all, motherfucker, at all

[Verse 1: Trizz]
Look, I know this bitch, Mercedes, she was a friend
Light-skinned bitch who ironically drove a Benz
Told me that they was dubs, I swear to you they was tens
Whatever, she had it all, and shockingly had no kids
It was 2010, introduced through my nig
""Hey, how you doing? Where you been?
Baby, my name is Trizz, I'm trying to go to the crib
Possibly get it in""
She told me she wasn't with it but said we could still be friends
Two years later, I'm seeing this bitch again
Hair fucked up walking with two of her kids
Ain't that some shit? Thirsty ass bitch
Ain't seen me in two years and tryna ride in my whip
Bitches ain't shit, it's funny how bitches get
I gave her some bus fare, two dollars and fifty cent
My personal fairy tale on bitches and how it is
They could be doing well and instantly turn to shit
Look at this bitch

[Chorus: Trizz]
Went from havin' it all
To havin' nothin' at all
From grindin' ready to ball
To window shoppin' in malls
From drivin' a new Benz
To city buses and kids
It's crazy what bitches was
It's crazy what bitches is
Went from havin' it all
To havin' nothin' at all
From grindin' ready to ball
To window shoppin' in malls
From drivin' a new Benz
To city buses and kids
It's crazy what bitches was
It's crazy what bitches is

[Verse 2: Chuwee]
How you go from three cars, four jobs, ass looking like Minaj
To a fuckin' Ford Taurus and you live in a garage
Had all the new shoes, two purses and the bomb
Now it's like you have SARS and the tissue on it scarred
Captain Picard, I was higher than the stars
When I '87 busted to your crib out in Arden
'Round the corner from the Arby's, God golly
Now you had too many molly, it done ruined your lil' body
'Member you told me that your momma was gon' get you a Bugatti?
You ain't mobbin' in no 'Rarri, let's go for calamari
Take me out to the movies and touch all over my body
All you do is fuckin' beg, now you hella fuckin' sorry
Pity date, I tried to reminisce on your pretty face
Titties late saggin', plus your pussy like a city-state
So many niggas at to the birthday party tryna to hit the cake
She be blowin' carloads full of niggas to hit the bass

[Chorus: Trizz]
Went from havin' it all
To havin' nothin' at all
From grindin' ready to ball
To window shoppin' in malls
From drivin' a new Benz
To city buses and kids
It's crazy what bitches was
It's crazy what bitches is
Went from havin' it all
To havin' nothin' at all
From grindin' ready to ball
To window shoppin' in malls
From drivin' a new Benz
To city buses and kids
It's crazy what bitches was
It's crazy what bitches is

[Verse 3: Skoolie 300]
Back then you was just a young buck
Who knew you'd grow up to be a dumb fuck?
Man, you used to be the smartest always studied your classwork
Now you on stages, niggas lookin' at your ass twerk
Ones bein' thrown, like that's what your ass worth
Used to see you on Sundays but now you past church
I pray for you, hope you get it right girl
Used to love the green, but now your nose all in white, girl
I know its hard, but it's life, girl
But you can have the same shit too, if you strive, girl
Remember back then, when you didn't want to hug me?
Wouldn't fuck me cause a nigga was a little too chubby
Now a nigga gettin' money and you see I'm up and coming
Now you want to be my friend, do I look like a dummy?
No, karma came back and it bit you in the ass
Man, I'm focused on my future, leave you bitches in the past

[Chorus: Trizz]
Went from havin' it all
To havin' nothin' at all
From grindin' ready to ball
To window shoppin' in malls
From drivin' a new Benz
To city buses and kids
It's crazy what bitches was
It's crazy what bitches is
Went from havin' it all
To havin' nothin' at all
From grindin' ready to ball
To window shoppin' in malls

It was a hot summers night around 90 degrees
Me & Rawls was out and about and we got a few Es
Ooh look to your left, -what do you see? (What do you see?)
Oh my, a silhouette makin' a killer threat, I had to reply
She was the baddest, her five ah-five five six [?]
With the silky brown skin, lipstick ah-lined her lips
With the pretty brown eyes with the long brown hair
What once was a look turned into a stare

[Verse 2: Fat Jon and J Rawls]
(It's gravitational) I feel her pullin', sweetest voice I ever heard
And the strangest thing is that she hasn't said a word
So quietly we approach (the window)
Gotta lеt the ends go, but it depеnds though [?]
(She did [?]) Smile was wicked
Now I'm about to enter like I just bought a ticket
Now it's fresh-mode inside the threshold
Her touch would make ya feel like ya didn't wanna let go

Ooh Vanessa, Vanessa
Got me feelin' the pressure

Meet me at the Royal Taste, in twenty-two
Yo son, I got some things to do, I'll be back -I'll have a brew
Yo son I'm back -let's bounce, I think it's time to break out
You got to tell me about your time with old girl -Ooh, no doubt

[Bridge: J Rawls [?]]
So with the sultry voice she sang a latin tune
The night-trumping scent floatin' around the room
She gave me a lot, but no more could she give me
I wanted took her special, but I know I wanna Mini [?]

[Verse 4: Fat Jon and J Rawls]
(It's like that?) Let's call a taxi -Ayo Jon let's get a slice (Aight)
And then it's back on the road to rock mics (Yup)
You caught a couple feelings, ' least to me that's how it seems
Will you see her again? -yeah, but only in my dreams

[Chorus]
Ooh Vanessa, Vanessa
Got me feelin' the pressure
Vanessa, Vanessa
How I wanna impress ya

Tired from having fun
Playing in the rain
And they pushed the sun aside and took her afternoon away
Then she turned to say

Tell me a bedtime story, Daddy
Tell me a bedtime story now

So she saw her dreams
Underneath her eyes
Animals and kings, ice cream, the park
And clowns with tambourines , chasing butterflies

Tell me a bedtime story, Daddy
Tell me a bedtime story now

Little angel, don’t you worry
I've a special bedtime story
Life is love and love is glory
We had you, so it must be true

The dimple near her chin
Breath so sweet and mild
Daddy tucked her in and touched her skin
And thought this is my child
Inside he smiled

Tipped across her bed
Gently closed the door
To himself he said, ""Oh, Lord, I know what all of this is for""
And there'll be more

1 EXT. HOT TRAXX NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA holds on this PACKED disco on Van Nuys Blvd.

TITLE CARD: ""San Fernando Valley, 1977""

A CADILLAC SEVILLE pulls up to the valet area and CAMERA (STEADICAM) moves across the street, towards the car, landing close;

From the Seville steps, JACK HORNER (50s) and AMBER WAVES (early 30s).
CAMERA follows them (this is one continous shot) as they pass the crowd,
greet a DOORMAN and enter --

INSIDE THE NIGHTCLUB. Twice as packed inside as outside. Music is full blast. Amber and Jack are greeted by;

MAURICE t.t. RODRIGUEZ (30s). Owner of the nightclub. Puerto Rican. Wearing a suit and fifteen gold chains.

MAURICE

Jackie-Jack-Jack and Miss Lovely Amber Waves --

AMBER

Hi, Maurice.

JACK

You bad ass little spick. How are you, honey?

MAURICE

Pissed off you ain't been around --

JACK

-- I been on vacation.

MAURICE

Don't stay away this long from my

club ever again, Jackie-Jack-Jack.

JACK

I promise.

Maurice takes Amber's hand and gives it a kiss.

MAURICE

You are the foxiest bitch in ten countries.

AMBER

You're such a charmer.

MAURICE

(to Jack)

I got you all set up at your booth.

I wanna send over some clams on the half shell.

JACK

Beautiful.

MAURICE

Just remember, Jack: I'm available

and ready. Cast me and find out --

JACK

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Amber and Jack head off towards the booth. CAMERA stays with Maurice,
follows him to the bar area, where he shouts some orders to a WAITER.

MAURICE

Clams on the half shell to Jack

and Amber -- over there -- go!

The WAITER takes off to the kitchen, Maurice walks onto the dance floor and
greets three people;

REED ROTHCHILD, 20s, tall and skinny, BECKY BARNETT, 20s, black girl in
silk, BUCK SWOPE, 20s, black guy in cowboy gear.

MAURICE

Hello there, kiddies.

REED/BUCK/BECKY

Hi, hey, hi, Maurice.

MAURICE

Having a good time?

BECKY

Excellent.

MAURICE

Great, great, great.

Maurice moves away to greet some more people. CAMERA stays with Reed, Becky
and Buck, does a 360 around them. Reed and Becky Disco Dance. Buck does
some Cowboy-Type Moves.

Moments later, the WAITER carrying clams on the half shell passes and
CAMERA picks up with him, follows him to Jack's booth, where he presents
them;

WAITER

Compliments of Maurice.

JACK

Thank you.

AMBER

Can I get a Marguerita, please?

JACK

Seven-Up, here --

The WAITER exits, CAMERA PANS with him for a moment, leading to a young
girl wearing rollerskates, ROLLERGIRL (aged 18). She always, always wears
rollerskates. CAMERA PANS with her back to Jack's booth.

ROLLERGIRL

Hi.

JACK

Hello, honey.

AMBER

(to Rollergirl)

Did you call that girl today?

ROLLERGIRL

I forgot.

AMBER

If you don't do it tomorrow, then it's

the weekend and you'll never be able to

get in to see her --

ROLLERGIRL

OK.

Rollergirl scratches her crotch as she speaks. Amber notices;

AMBER

What's the matter down there?

ROLLERGIRL

I gotta go pee.

AMBER

Well go, then.

CAMERA stays with Rollergirl, following her across the dance floor. She
passes Buck, Becky and Reed, says hello, dances a moment, then continues on
-- into the clearing off the dance floor, heading for the bathroom. She
passes something, CAMERA moves away towards this something:

A bus boy cleaning a table, EDDIE ADAMS, aged 17. CAMERA moves into a CU --
blending to SLOW MOTION (40fps) for a moment.

(Note: In the text Eddie Adams will be referred to as Dirk Diggler.)

ANGLE, JACK'S TABLE.

Jack turns his head, looks across the dance floor and sees this kid
cleaning the table.

ANGLE, DIRK DIGGLER.

He looks up, catches Jack looking back at him, then turns away, disappears
into a back room.

CAMERA DOLLIES in on Jack, who at that moment, is approached by a figure
entering FRAME. Short, buffed out LITTLE BILL (late 40s). This is Jack's
Assistant Director.

LITTLE BILL

Jack.

JACK

Hey, Little Bill.

LITTLE BILL

Whatsa schedule look like?

Are we still on day after tomorrow?

JACK

I wanna do it the day after

the day after tomorrow.

LITTLE BILL

Rocky, Scotty, Kurt and all those guys --

Jack's attention is with the backroom that Dirk entered. He stands and
heads away.

JACK

Absolutely. But I wanna keep it small.

I wanna keep a small crew on this one --

LITTLE BILL

JACK

Exactly.

LITTLE BILL

Do you have a script yet?

A crowded high school geometry classroom. In the back of the class, sitting

Rollergirl looks it over; a lot of questions, diagrams and generally
confusing material. She looks across the room;

Two BOYS are looking at her and chuckling to themselves. One guy looks to
the other and makes a ""blow job"" gesture.

cowboy-digs, is talking to a CUSTOMER about a stereo unit. The manager, a
skinny-white guy with a mustache and mustard suit, JERRY (30s) is standing
nearby.

BUCK

-- so basically you're gettin'

twice the base, cause of the TK421

modification we got in this system here.

CUSTOMER

I don't know - do I need that much bass?

BUCK

If you want a system to handle

what you want -- yes you do.

See this system here. This is Hi-Fi.

""High Fidelity."" What that means is

that it's the highest quality fidelity.

CUSTOMER

It's the price --

BUCK

I have this unit at home.

CUSTOMER

. . . really . . . ?

BUCK

Yes. But -- I've got it modified

with the TK421, which is a bass unit

that basically kicks in another two,

maybe three quads when you really

crank -- lemme put another eight track

in so you can get a better idea what

I'm talkin about --

Buck ejects the Eight Track that was playing and puts in his own of a
country western song.

BUCK

Hear that bass? It kicks and turns

and curls up in your belly, makes you

wanna freaky-deaky, right? If you get

this unit as it is -- it won't sound

like this without the modification --

and we do that for a small price.

The Customer listens another moment, then;

CUSTOMER

Thank you for your time.

BUCK

No problem.

The Customer exits and Jerry approaches Buck.

JERRY

. . . the fuck was that?

BUCK

Wha?

JERRY

Have I told you? Huh? Have I?

BUCK

What? I don't --

JERRY

Alright: A.) You play that country

western-crap and no one's gonna buy

a stereo. You throw on some KC and

the Sunshine Band, a guy looks a particular

way -- and you've seen the profile sheet --

you throw on some Led Zeppelin. No.

Instead, you play this twingy-twangy,

yappy-dappy music. What kinda brother

are you anyway, listening to that shit?

BUCK

Hey, Jerry, look --

JERRY

No, you look. I gave you a job here

because I thought your film work

might bring some nice pussy in the

place -- and it has -- but I can't

have anymore fuck ups -- you dig?

Yeah.

This thing here, I mean, you understand

one thing and that's this: It costs.

I mean, this stuff costs good ol' American

Green. You got film, you got lights,

you got sound, lab fees, developing, synching,

editing -- next thing you know you're

spending thirty/forty thousand a picture.

DIRK

That's a lot of money.

JACK

Hell yes it's a lot of money, but lemme

tell you something else: You make a good

film and there's practically no end to the

amount of money you can make, Eddie.

AMBER

Have you seen Jack's house?

CAMERA HOLDS ON AMBER. She watches Dirk.

DIRK (OC)

No.

JACK (OC)

Eddie: You got ten, fifteen people around

and that's just to make sure the lighting is

right . . . shit, this is not an operation for

the weak, and lemme tell you something else:

When all is said and done, you gotta have the

juice, you understand? I mean . . . you can work

on your arms, your legs, workout morning, day,

noon, night, the whole deal, but when it comes

right down to it . . . what we need is Mr. Torpedo

Area, y'understand? Mr. Fun Zone? Okay, let's

say you got that: right? And You Do Got, Yeah?

He looks to Rollergirl. She smiles. CAMERA OFF AMBER NOW.

JACK

I can go out -- tonight -- the reputation

I got: I can find myself 15/20 guys,

cocks the size of Willie Mays Baseball Bat:

Do I want that? No. Do I need that? No.

I need actors.

AMBER

Uhhh-ohhh . . . here we go --

JACK

-- Alright, yeah, I need the big dick,

and the big tits -- that GETS them in

the theater. What keeps them in their

seats even after they've come? Huh?

The beauty and the acting.

If you're able to give it up and show the world:

No, not just your cock. Fuck that.

What I'm talking about is showing your

insides, from your heart . . . you understand?

Hey, Sure: GET THEM IN THE THEATER.

That's one thing. I don't want 'em showing up,

sitting down, jacking off and splitting on

the story. I don't want to make that film.

I wanna make the thing that keeps 'em around

even after they've come . . . what happens when you

come? You're done, you wanna split.

My idea, my goal: Suck 'em in with the

story . . . they'll squirt their load and sit in it . . .

Just To See How The Story Ends.

Sometimes we make these films, we wanna

make people laugh a little, then get into

it and fuck heavy: That's good and that's fine.

But I got a dream of making a film that's

true . . . true and right and dramatic.

DIRK

. . . Right . . . right . . . I understand.

AMBER

Don't listen too hard to all this,

honey . . . it's just nice in theory.

JACK

It's a dream to be able to find

a cock and an actor.

her clothes off.

ROLLERGIRL

ROLLERGIRL

Ohhh-yeah.

JACK

The idea is this: Amber is a director

of porno films and she's down on her luck.

She hasn't had a hit in a year. She's

desperate. Her landlord is threatening to kick her

out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right?

COLONEL

Yes. Good dilemma.

JACK

Yes. So she calls up all the agencies

in town and says: ""Send over your best

actors, I'm casting a porno picture.""

Well, the story goes and develops with

Amber auditioning various men and

women . . . the whole thing wraps up with

the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if

he's still in town to play the part --

he comes in -- the landlord says:

You better pay rent or you're through.

Well, Amber does one helluva suck job,

ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing

and fade out - the end.

That's great.

JACK

There's a kid, a young man, I met him

last night: His name is Eddie Adams.

He's here, he's at the party. He's something

special and I want to cast him.

What films has he done?

JACK

This would be his first.

getting some more lights, too, y'know --

LITTLE BILL

That's terrible.

DIRK

But I'm back now and I'm ready to pursue

My landlord is a real jerk.

DIRK

Really?

AMBER

Why don't you take your pants off?

It's important that I get an idea of your size.

JACK

Tell me.

DIRK

I don't like to see women treated that way.

This guy he plays, ""Johnny Wad,"" it's always

about slapping some girl around or whatever.

It's not right, it's not cool and it just . . .

isn't sexy. It isn't sexy like it should be.

REED

We could make it more of a James Bond

character. This guy that's world traveled.

JACK

I like that.

DIRK

Reed could play my partner.

JACK

I like this a lot.

DIRK

We could make it really good, Jack.

Honestly. If you direct it . . . we could

make a whole series, with a whole story.

This is exactly what we've always talked about.

We should do this.

JACK

Alright. When we get back. We'll set up

DIRK

Wow. I dunno what to say . . . I guess. Wow.

I guess the only thing I can say, is that

I promise to keep rocking and rolling and

to keep making better films. It seems we make

these movies . . . and sometimes . . . they're considered

filthy or something by some people . . . but I don't

think that's true. These films we make can be

I can paint, too.

DIRK

Yes. Yes. Yes.

JESSIE

I dunno. I was just never really secure.

When I was a kid, I was never really secure

with myself that much -- I guess that's why

I try and act like I'm all care-free and everything.

DIRK

I know what you mean, sometimes I'm like,

""What am I doing?"" ""What the hell is wrong

91 INT. JACK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Jack, Floyd Gondolli and the Colonel sitting.

FLOYD

. . . so let's talk about the future.

So let's talk about what video means

to this industry -- and let's talk

about how all of us -- not one of us --

but all of us will profit. I've been doing

theater work in San Francisco and San Diego

for as long as you've been doing stag

and hardcore, Jack.

JACK

I know you're history, Floyd.

COLONEL

No one's doubting your history

or your credentials, Floyd.

FLOYD

Then why the resistance? I mean:

This industry is going to be turned

upside down soon enough --

JACK

Then why help it?

FLOYD

Why not be prepared? The money comes

from the Colonel, the talent comes from

you, Jack. I've got a connection to the

equipment and the mail order distribution,

not to mention those kids I got out there

who are hot-fuck-action to the max.

This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.

JACK

I have a stable of actors and actresses.

They're professionals. They're not

a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're

proven box office and they get people

in theaters (where films should be seen)

and they know how to fuck well --

FLOYD

That's right, Jack and by that

same token, you're the one with the

power here. The video revolution

is upon us -- and our role is critical.

We have an obligation to use our resources

and talent to help make it fly --

JACK

You come in here, at my party, tell me about

this and that -- tell me about the future,

tell me about -- video and amateurs and

all that -- well lemme tell you something now:

I will not shoot films on video and no

I will not loan out my actors who are

under contract to me. Period.

FLOYD

Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man.

I like cinema. In particular, I like to

see fucking on film. I don't want to win

an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the

wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter

in my ass and lollipops in my mouth.

That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert,

but this is something I enjoy. One other

small thing I want to do in this life is make

a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not

trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay

one step ahead of the game --

JACK

We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.

COLONEL

Jack, I think this is about cost and future --

JACK

The future is as bright as we make it --

it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars

that can be saved shooting on video tape --

if it looks like shit and sounds like shit,

it probably is shit --

FLOYD

I think you're one gin past this conversation --

JACK

No . . . no. I'm crystal clear here.

COLONEL

Jack, please understand that this is

not an argument . . . this is a fact of --

JACK

. . . What . . . ?

COLONEL

This is not an argument, but a --

JACK

What are you saying?

COLONEL

What do you mean, Jack, c'mon --

JACK

Are you telling me that you're

working with this shit?

COLONEL

I think that there is a serious case

to be made for the price and the gamble

on the whole idea of a home video market --

Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's

gonna be able to walk into their local

supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --

JACK

True film fans won't watch that shit.

It doesn't look good and more importantly

it doesn't make sex look sexy.

COLONEL

It doesn't have to look good, Jack.

Film is just too damn expensive.

The theaters are already planning

converting to video projectors.

JACK

I haven't heard that.

FLOYD

It's true.

JACK

We've got ten minutes until the New

Year and I don't want it to start like this

so I'm leaving now. We will or we won't

continue this conversation some other time.

I'm Kathleen O'Malley. The judge.

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

You have a lawyer with you?

AMBER

No. I don't. I do not.

They sit in silence. The Judge looks over a couple of files. Moments later,
Amber's ex-husband, THOMAS (late 30s) steps in with his LAWYER. They all
take seats.

LAWYER

Hello, Judge.

Introductions happen, etc. BEAT. The Judge looks over some files;

JUDGE

You've been divorced for six years.

AMBER

Yes. Since 1977.

JUDGE

(to lawyer)

And the agreement on the money settlement

was taken care of?

LAWYER

Yes.

JUDGE

So. What we're talking about then

is coming to an agreement on custody of Andrew?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

What was decided during the divorce?

LAWYER

Initially, Andrew went with his father,

and visitation was given to his mother on --

(looks at a paper)

from Saturday Noon to Sunday at seven.

With his mother entitled to bring Andrew

to her home or any reasonable place.

JUDGE

(to Amber)

Was that the understanding?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

And why wasn't that visiting privilege honored?

THOMAS

Well, it was for a time --

AMBER

I only saw him twice.

THOMAS

It said, ""reasonable place,"" and I didn't

think a house of drugs and prostitution

and pornography was that.

JUDGE

I'm sorry, what is it that you --

THOMAS

My ex-wife is involved in the pornography

business -- I didn't think that environment

was a safe place for my son.

AMBER

This is not right. My son was never

exposed to pornographic material or

drugs or any of these things, my husband

just assumed --

THOMAS

I saw it with my own eye.

PAUSE. Amber has no response. The Judge looks down at the file.

JUDGE

Did you register this as a complaint?

LAWYER

My client didn't officially register,

but I think the circumstance called

for something immediate -- for the

safety of the child.

JUDGE

How old is the boy now?

THOMAS

He's twelve.

AMBER

He'll be thirteen next month.

JUDGE

Where do you live now?

THOMAS

We live in Long Beach. I have a job

there and my new wife is home with him.

You see, the problem is, Judge, is that

my ex-wife is a sick . . . she is a very sick

person and she needs help. She deals in

drugs and sex for a living --

AMBER

I don't do drugs.

LAWYER

Your honor, she has been in and out

of trouble with the law on quite a few

occasions regarding this sort of thing.

AMBER

No. No. Not anymore

160 INT. LIMO - PARKED - NIGHT - CONTINUED

The limo is pulled over and Jack is speaking through the window to some
YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENT, wearing a backpack. (This kid is one of the boys who
was making sexual gestures to Rollergirl earlier in the movie).

JACK

What do you say?

COLLEGE KID

I dunno -- you mean it.

JACK

Anything you wanna do -- you do it.

Do you see this young lady here?

COLLEGE KID

Yeah.

JACK

You like what you see?

COLLEGE KID

Sure.

JACK

Then get in here and do what you want.

The College Kid gets in the car, sits next to Rollergirl, who nods hello.
She may or may not recognize him. Jack gets in the seat opposite (behind
the CAMERA).

JACK

You a student?

COLLEGE KID

Um . . . um . . . yeah.

JACK

Oh, great. Where do you go to school?

COLLEGE KID

Um . . . uh . . . do I have to say?

JACK

No, no. Anyway. How'd you like to go round

with Rollergirl? Have you seen her film work?

COLLEGE KID

. . . yeah . . . yeah I have.

(to Rollergirl)

We watch your films in my frat house.

I go to CSUN. The fuckin' guys are never

gonna believe this --

JACK

Alright . . . fantastic cool . . .

COLLEGE KID

ROLLERGIRL

Really?

BEAT.

COLLEGE KID

CUT TO:

161 EXT. STUDIO CITY/ALLEYWAY - NIGHT (LATER)

Dirk is standing in an alleyway. HEADLIGHTS FLOAT ACROSS A WALL, CATCHING A
GLIMPSE OF DIRK. A small Toyota drives up and stops next to Dirk. A FIGURE
inside the car speaks;

FIGURE

Hello.

DIRK

Hey.

FIGURE

Are you waiting for someone?

DIRK

. . . yeah. I'm waiting for someone.

I'm not sure if they're gonna show up though.

SURFER

Dirk nods his head a little. HOLD.

DIRK

Twenty bucks.

SURFER

Ten is all I have . . .

CUT TO:

164 INT. LIMO - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

The limo is moving now. Jack is sitting behind the CAMERA. The LIGHT held
above the Camcorder SHINES brightly on them.

Rollergirl and the College Kid struggle in the seat. He has some trouble
removing his pants and she tries to help a little, but it's pretty obvious
she's not enjoying this. Jack tries to coach them from the sidelines;

JACK

Alright, there, pal; make it look

good, make it sexy -- don't just ram

your way up and in there --

The College Kid doesn't respond.

JACK

Hey, hey, hey . . . take it slow and

make it kinky, kid. C'mon.

Think of Miss Lovely Rollergirl

as a beautiful instrument that you

need to play . . . c'mon now . . . slow down . . .

Pretend you're just a wonderful stud,

pretend you're a wonderful stud that's

just ready to melt her pussy . . . hey, kid . . . ?

Are you listening to me? Hey -- hey --

COLLEGE KID

Just let me do my thing, man.

JACK

Cut. Stop. Cut.

The College Kid looks a little pissed, Rollergirl pushes him off;

ROLLERGIRL

This is stupid, Jack.

JACK

I know . . . this isn't working out.

COLLEGE KID

That's it?

JACK (OC)

Yeah, that's all. Sorry for the inconvenience.

The College Kid pulls his pants on.

COLLEGE KID

You got me hard -- you could at least

jack me off or something, lady.

ROLLERGIRL

What the fuck did you say?

COLLEGE KID

It's not so cool to leave me

with a hard on.

ROLLERGIRL

Fuck you.

COLLEGE KID

Nice life you've got here. Should

be proud of what you've become . . .

The College Kid laughs a little, heads out of the car, turns back to Jack
and says:

COLLEGE KID

Your fuckin' films suck now anyway.

ANGLE, CU. JACK

CAMERA DOLLIES IN A LITTLE IN SLOW MOTION. He freaks out.

Jack CHARGES out of the limo TACKLING the College Kid to the Ground. He
starts to BEAT the shit out of him . . .

CUT TO:

165 INT. TOYOTA - PARKED - THAT MOMENT

Dirk zips his pants open. The Surfer kid's eyes watch closely. Dirk pulls
out his cock and the Surfer kid looks surprised, speaks sotto;

SURFER

. . . holy shit . . . that's nice . . . that's . . . big . . .

Dirk nods, looks down.

SURFER

Why don't you jerk it a little,

get it hard? I wanna see it get hard.

Dirk's hand touches his cock and he starts to masturbate a little. The
Surfer kid watches. CAMERA BEGINS A PAINFULLY SLOW ZOOM INTO PROFILE XCU.
ON DIRK.

SURFER

. . . maybe . . . do it harder . . .

Dirk does it harder and faster.

SURFER

Get your hand wet.

DIRK

. . . be quiet . . .

Dirk tries to do it faster and harder.

SURFER

. . . c'mon . . . c'mon . . . c'mon . . .

Dirk tries harder and faster but only gets more frustrated. He verges on
tears, looks to the Surfer Kid.

DIRK

I can't . . . I can't get it hard . . . I can't.

I'm sorry --

SUDDENLY:

A PICK-UP TRUCK carrying THREE PUNK KIDS SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES IN FRONT OF
DIRK IN THE TOYOTA. Dirk looks up in shock, turns his head to the Surfer
Kid who says;

SURFER

You shouldn't do this sort of thing, faggot.

Surfer PUNCHES Dirk in the face . . .

CUT TO:

166 EXT. VENTURA BLVD. - NIGHT - THAT MOMENT

Jack continues to BEAT the College Kid and yell at him;

JACK

YOU HAVE SOME FUCKING RESPECT.

YOU LITTLE PRICK. YOU HAVE SOME GODDAMN

RESPECT FOR THAT GIRL. SHE'S A STAR,

A WONDERFUL CHILD AND A STAR. You think

you're worthy to fuck her -- you're not

worthy to TOUCH her -- the way you fuck --

who taught you? WHO TAUGHT YOU HOW TO FUCK

THAT WAY? YOU'RE AN AMATEUR. AN AMATEUR.

He KICKS the College Kid again and again . . . CAMERA DOLLIES IN ON
ROLLERGIRL as she watches. She rolls over . . . stands a BEAT over the
College Kid . . . and then goes crazy . . . she SMASHES his face with her
ROLLERSKATES over and over and over;

She breaks down CRYING and SCREAMING . . . Jack pulls her off . . .

CUT TO:

167 EXT. PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT

The FOUR SURFER PUNKS drag Dirk from the car and proceed to beat the shit
out of him. Kicking and punching him, calling out;

SURFERS

Little Fuckin' Fag. Donkey-Dick.

You don't do this. You don't.

They continue to yell and scream and kick and punch Dirk and eventually
peel out of the parking lot. Dirk moans and cries and holds his stomach in
pain. He coughs up some blood and vomit . .

CAMERA PANS away from him, looking out of the alleyway, toward Ventura
Blvd. HOLD WIDE ANGLE ON THE STREET, EMPTY FRAME, THEN;

The WHITE LIMO carrying Jack and Rollergirl cruises PAST.

JESSIE

I want . . . um . . . apple fritter . . . Jelly . . .

And uh . . . chocolate with sprinkles . . . and

a bear claw, too . . .

Buck gets out of the car and we reveal that she is SIX MONTHS PREGNANT.
Buck looks down;

JESSIE

He's kicking ass inside my stomach.

BUCK

That's a boy.

CUT TO:

169 INT. DONUT SHOP - NIGHT

Buck enters and looks at some donuts, helped by the DONUT BOY behind the
counter. A MIDDLE AGED MAN in a camouflage baseball hat sits in the corner
eating a donut and some coffee, reading 'Guns and Ammo.'

DONUT BOY

Can I help you?

BUCK

Yeah . . . I'm gonna get a dozen . . .

The Donut Boy gets a box and Buck starts to point out;

BUCK

Lemme get two bear claws . . . apple fritter . . .

Two chocolate . . . two sprinkles . . . gimme

some of those glazed . . . how many is that?

At that moment a PUERTO RICAN KID walks in, pulls a REVOLVER from his
pocket and points at the Donut Boy.

PUERTO RICAN KID

Empty the safe. Behind the soda machine.

BUCK

Jesus Christ.

The Puerto Rican Kid SWINGS HIS AIM at Buck.

PUERTO RICAN KID

Don't talk . . . shut the fuck up . . .

(aims back at Donut Boy)

Okay . . . empty the safe . . .

Donut Boy starts to empty the safe, putting the money in a paper sack . . .
Buck is frozen . . .

The MIDDLE AGED MAN in the corner reaches into his coat pocket and pulls
out an extremely BIG GUN . . .

The Middle Aged Man SHOOTS the Puerto Rican Kid in the BACK . . .

. . . the Puerto Rican Kid turns and returns FIRE, hitting the Middle Aged
Man with a bullet in the FACE . . .

. . . The Middle Aged Man gets another wild SHOT off before he expires and
that bullet hits the Donut Boy in the CHEST . . .

So: The Donut Boy is dead, The Puerto Rican Kid falls to the floor dead and

Reed, Todd and Dirk sit around a table. Dirk is bandaged. Scotty J. is
mingling around the background. CAMERA DOES A SLOW 360 AROUND THE TABLE.

TODD

Alright. I think this could be the thing.

Something to help us score a little extra cash.

I think if we decide to do this, we gotta

be one hundred percent.

REED

I agree.

TODD

This guy's name is Rahad Jackson.

He's got more money than God and twice

as much coke, crack and smack. He'll buy

just about anything anybody wants to sell him.

He just likes people hanging out at his house

and partying.

DIRK

How do you know him?

TODD

He used to come into Party Boys

once in a while. Mutrix introduced me --

DIRK

And how would we do it, exactly?

I mean, how would it all go down?

TODD

It's like this: I call him up,

tell him I got half a key of quality stuff.

REED

Do you have his phone number?

TODD

Yeah. So we call him up, give him the price.

DIRK

How much?

TODD

Half a key for like . . . five thousand bucks.

Split it three ways --

DIRK

That's enough to get my Vette fixed.

TODD

That's right. So we set up the deal,

dump half a kilo of baking soda in a

bag and walk over to his house -- BOOM.

Right there -- this could be a nifty bit

o' hustle-bustle.

REED

Do you have his address?

TODD

Fuckin', Reed, yeah I have his address, c'mon.

DIRK

What if he tests it out?

TODD

He won't.

DIRK

How do you know?

TODD

I know he won't. I'm positive. Believe me.

REED

It's a pretty good idea.

DIRK

I think we should go for it.

Scotty J. comes over to the table.

SCOTTY J.

You guys should be careful with this.

DIRK

Scotty?

SCOTTY J.

What?

DIRK

Just . . . y'know . . . mind yer own business.

SCOTTY J.

Sorry.

Okay.

TODD

You guys ready for this?

REED

I am.

TODD

Dirk?

DIRK

Me? Yeah . . . yeah, I'm ready. I was born ready.

TODD

Alright.

Todd takes out a .45 AUTOMATIC PISTOL and loads a cartridge.

DIRK

What the fuck is that?

TODD

It's a big gun.

DIRK

I know, but why?

TODD

Just in case, just in case. Let's go.

They pile out of the damaged Corvette and walk up. CAMERA (STEADICAM)
follows them.

REED

I'm nervous.

TODD

It'll be okay.

REED

Let's get in and out, in and out.

TODD

Not too quick -- that looks suspicious.

Lemme do the talking --

They arrive and ring the doorbell.

CUT TO:

173 INT. RAHAD JACKSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - THAT MOMENT

A really big fat black BODYGUARD comes to the door and opens up:

BODYGUARD

Hello. Come on in.

The bodyguard leads them down a hall and into a tacky and spacious, sunken
LIVING ROOM.

They're greeted by a man in a silk robe, slightly open to show some bikini
briefs and a thin sheen of sweat covering his body: RAHAD JACKSON (late
40s).

Off in a corner of the room, a YOUNG ASIAN KID is casually throwing some
FIRECRACKERS around.

Rahad is DANCING around by himself to NIGHT RANGER, ""SISTER CHRISTIAN."" He
spots the men;

RAHAD

Hello, friends. Which one is Todd?

TODD

That's me. We met before at the club --

RAHAD

Oh, yeah. Come on in here.

TODD

These are my friends Dirk and Reed.

RAHAD

Great to meet you. You guys want something

to drink -- or a pill -- or some coke --

or some dope?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you, thanks, no.

RAHAD

So what do we have, we have, something, yeah?

TODD

Here it is . . . half a key . . . it's really good,

if you wanna test it out --

RAHAD

Oh, wait a minute, I love this part:

(sings along)

""SISTER CHRISTIAN, THERE'S SO MUCH

IN LIFE, DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP BEFORE

YOUR TIME IS DUE . . . IT'S TRUE!""

(to Dirk)

This song is so amazing.

Anyway: What's the price?

TODD

We were thinking five thousand.

RAHAD

That's good. No problem, cool, cool.

The Bodyguard brings over a PAPER BAG FULL OF CASH and hands the bag to
Todd in exchange for the PAPER BAG FULL OF BAKING SODA.

Reed watches the Bodyguard take the bag and notices something. REED'S POV:
a SHOULDER HOLSTER holds a .45 Automatic Pistol.

Rahad does an air guitar solo to the Night Ranger song . . . he walks
across the room, picks up a COKE PIPE and looks to the guys;

RAHAD

You wanna play baseball?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you.

Rahad strokes the pipe while dancing. Dirk looks across to an open bedroom
door.

DIRK'S POV: Through the crack in the door, we can see a bloody, battered
YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in a silk robe . . .she's followed by another YOUNG WHITE
GIRL in nothing.

RAHAD (OC)

Check this out --

He takes out a nickel plated REVOLVER and loads a single bullet, spins the
chamber and puts it to his head and sings;

RAHAD

SISTER CHRISTIAN -- OH THE TIME HAS

COME . . . AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE

THE ONLY ONE TO SAY . . . OK . . .

He pulls the trigger . . . Click . . . he smiles and casually speaks;

RAHAD

I put a mix tape together of all

my favorite songs . . . This is song number

three . . . I love putting mix tapes together,

you know . . . if you buy an album or tape or

something, those guys put the songs in their

order and they try and say how you should listen

to the songs, but I don't like that.

I don't like to be told what to listen

to, when to listen to or anything . . .

The Night Ranger song FADES OUT . . . BEAT . . . Rahad smiles at the Asian
Kid who's casually throwing some firecrackers around.

RAHAD

(to Dirk/Reed/Todd)

He's Chinese . . . he loves to set

off firecrackers . . .

REO SPEEDWAGON, ""CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING,"" begins to play.

RAHAD

I CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING ANY LONGER

AND YET I'm STILL AFRAID TO LET IT FLOW.

WHAT STARTED OUT AS FRIENDSHIP HAS GROWN

STRONGER -- I ONLY WISH I HAD THE STRENGTH

TO LET IT SHOW --

DIRK

Well . . . I think maybe . . . we better get going --

RAHAD

No, stay. Hang out. We'll party.

DIRK

No, we really gotta split.

We have to be somewhere and we --

Dirk and Rahad continue to haggle about leaving/not leaving. CAMERA BEGINS
A SLOW DOLLY INTO A CU ON TODD.

TODD

We're Not Leaving Yet.

Dirk and Reed look at Todd. He stands up.

TODD

We're here now and we want something else.

Hey -- Hey. We Want Something Else From You.

RAHAD

What?

DIRK

Todd -- what the hell are you doing?

TODD

In the master bedroom, under the bed,

in a floor safe . . . You understand?

The Bodyguard turns his head. Dirk and Reed are confused;

DIRK

Todd . . . what the fuck, man, c'mon --

TODD

Shut up, Dirk. I told you I got a plan.

I got a good plan.

RAHAD

Are you kiddin' me kittie?

TODD

No I'm not. I'm not kidding. We want

what's in the safe. We want what's in

the safe in the floor under the bed in

the master bedroom.

DIRK

Todd -- don't be crazy.

(to Rahad)

Sir -- we don't know anything about this.

This is not the thing that we wanted.

TODD

SHUT THE FUCK UP, DIRK.

The BODYGUARD reaches into his coat . . .

. . . Todd pulls his REVOLVER quickly and AIMS at the Bodyguard.

TODD

Don't reach for your gun.

. . . Rahad reacts by AIMING HIS GUN AT TODD . . .

RAHAD

You don't wanna do this, friendly.

TODD

You've only got one bullet.

Rahad PULLS THE TRIGGER . . . a bullet FIRES from the gun and strikes Todd
in the SHOULDER . . . the gun in his hand falls to the floor and he
stumbles back . . .

. . . The Bodyguard takes this moment to GRAB HIS OWN GUN from the holster
and FIRE off shots at Dirk and Reed . . .

STRAIGHT INTO the Bodyguard . . . who falls back DEAD . . . Todd looks
right and sees:

RAHAD scuttles into the bedroom with the women . . . Todd looks over his
shoulder to Dirk and Reed;

DIRK

WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, TODD?

TODD

He went in the bedroom.

DIRK

ARE YOU CRAZY? WHEN DID YOU GO CRAZY?

TODD

He's got cash and coke in the safe

under the bed -- if we leave here

without it we're fools.

REED

Let's just split, let's just split

right now, Todd. Don't be stupid.

This wasn't part of the deal.

TODD

I'm goin' in that bedroom and get what's

in that safe. Are you coming?

DIRK

Fuck no. Todd. Don't. Don't do it.

Todd gets up and heads for the bedroom with his revolver at the ready . . .
he inches closer to the door and twists the door knob, then KICKS THE DOOR
OPEN;

. . . Rahad is standing right there, holding a SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. He pulls
the trigger . . . Todd blinks . . .

feet . . . he FALLS to the ground with a HOLE in his STOMACH about the size
of a basketball . . . Rahad calls out to Dirk and Reed;

RAHAD

C'mon out, little puppies. You want to

come and see, come and see, to get what

is coming down. Coming down.

Rahad peers out from his bedroom, sees a sliver of Dirk behind the wall.
Rahad FIRES HIS SHOTGUN . . . which cuts right past Dirk's head and SHREDS
the wall near him . . .

多分そう 暗い穴から抜けるとき
多分そう イマが 次元の突破口

分厚いコートを脱ぎ捨てれば

ビートの隙間に流れるものを感じていて
ドクンと心臓が高鳴れば
春はトワに目覚める

In the streets they yelling peace peace, deuce deuce

Not ballerinas, but cracking nuts are the theme of
Ballets in the hood but on to better arena's
Hip hops gladiator
Roaming amphitheatre's
Am I the next Spartacus or the shell of a savior
Truly this you should savor
Taste the rhymes that I bake up
Swoon a room with a tune
Never mind why she caked up
Not wasting words, enough
Trash on your player
Audio reaks of shit illustration, feces the make up
Of every word that they think up
Hater hater I'm player
Shaken up every pussy, but you don't see a vibrator
Less you talking 'bout subs in the trunk
Cranking the bass up
Bass in my voice I'm sonically dope
Come see the heir
The funkadactic future funker vapor rocking slayer
The jazzy swinging lofi ringing trapping snapping tailor
Fitting for any beat that choose to knit for a player
I can wear concious ignorance ignorance, each attire has flair
For now it's just me and Ocean, scoping honey's to pry
Bear in mind we call 'em birds 'cause they look to soar to the sky
But unzipping my jeans is the only way that she fly
Truth hurts, I sigh, believe hearts can tie
Together knots to better

君は微笑みだけで
海辺のヴィラ夏に変えてく

シャツに着替え 何故走りだすの

[Pre-Chorus]
熱いこころの波打際へと
近づく僕の誘いかわして

君が見た 夢なら
If you give me your heart

目を閉じた Endless summer

君のいない時間に
かけた電話 何故か言えない
少し勇気をだして
待ち伏せした 今 渚はトワイライト

[Pre-Chorus]
もしも君だけ夜にまぎれても
銀の涙は僕に返して

[Chorus]
君は1000%
輝くハレーの雫を
その髪に 散りばめ
If you give me your heart
陽射しも溶けるフォトグラフ
ここだけが Brand new summer

しなやかな仕草と渡されたカクテル
恋のめまい飲み干す

目を閉じた Endless summer

言えない 言葉 沈めて

そっと叱ってよ艶色のサイレン
もうどうしようもないねと呆れたりして
二月の辛抱雨に打たれては
毎日浪費してまた朝になって

くだらないと笑って
汚れてしまった眼差しも
顔色ばかり気にして
踊れやしないのに

「もうほっといてよ」って一人じゃ何も出来ないくせに
本当は弱いんだろう強がったふりなんてしないでよ
どこを探しても見つかるはずのない
記憶飛ばすまで呑んで It's feel So Fine！

贅沢な罠を仕掛けてよダーリン
冷めきった態度で祝ったりして
同伴のシンボル外したら迷子
お決まりのフレーズで愛を読んだりして

期待させてみたいの
感じたことのないムードで
忘れることにしたんだ
毒に溺れていった

「もうほっといてよ」って一人じゃ何も出来ないくせに
本当は弱いんだろう強がったふりなんてしないでよ
どこを探しても見つかるはずのない

何処にいたって痛みはもう感じないよ

This whiskey got me feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

[Chorus]
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to say

215,21285,Without You,Anderson .Paak,"[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Say, I should take this heart and pawn it at the auction
I don't need it, I'ma slang this bitch and take ya shoppin'
'Cause what good is any heart if it can break in pieces?
I would rather have no feelings, than cryin' and sobbin'
When I met you, I was broke as the rope on the faucet
I had dreams that I would blow like a Nintendo Cartridge
I was hungry, I was dirty, I needed a shower
Said you fed me, and you clothed me, you packed me a sack lunch
Papa said, ""When I get older, get a girl like your momma""
But I'm twenty (cough) years old and runnin' out of options
How I'm supposed to trust ya?
Ain't you one of them ones tryin' to run up
Pose for the perfect picture, upload and post it?
Question: Is you with me or not?
I'm from the city where they wear bikinis in the water drought
But I'm used to having cyclones blown in and out of my life
So it's no biggie if you need time to figure it out

With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you

You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
You know you wrong, shit, you out of pocket
Remember you was couch surfin', you ain't have a casa
And mi casa, I would buy you shoes from out the locker
Even though I heard around the town from all the gossip
Between they legs and slidin' limousines in garages
Heard your mama cheated on ya daddy, you just like her
Karma come around, remember what happened to Tiger
Game over, dead wrong, uh, Biggie Wallace
I was the one you counted on before you stacked your wallets
Talkin' 'bout me, motherfucker, you the one with problems
Haha, you played yourself for a photo, uh, that you ain't know, though
I only took from niggas trying to slide up in the DM
And show 'em I was happy with the nigga I was seein'
But you fucked up, stupid, so I guess I'll go and see 'em
As you contemplate how to get me back like Liam
No fuckin' tonight, I'll be gone by the PM, nigga

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you

If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you

A King in my past life, I stand in my own body
Born again, bar God, I prove myself to nobody
Cold coffins, teardrops, spilt milk
Cashmere
My attire, no wrinkles found in my silk
I feel suspect (I feel suspect)
Wonder what my people might do to photo demons
If I spoke a word of my story would they believe it?
Paragraphs at them with these poems, hope they conceive it
Rather they admire my tone and flawless features
(Eh, wait)
Born 'n raised in Hackney
Never seen the ocean
Never learned the language
Never saw my talent till they showed me (what else?)
Didn't know my worth until they owned me
Walked the same streets as the ones who claimed I was different
Wore the same shoes, the uniform was kickers
Heard the same taunts as the cow that called us niggers
Heard the same excuses when feathers squeezing them triggers
But even for it all they still look at me like the winner

Save the penny for the preacher

Taught my lessons to my teacher

[Verse 3: Shola Ama, Kojey Radical]
I hope you don't see
Everything you said was written in brow
Every promise that you made had cinnamon smell
Caramel scented, sweet like taboo
Shola Ama on a Sunday play Beanie mental
Had the living room spotless
Had the kitchen on comfort
Your Mumma taught you well, your Daddy didn't deserve her
They both made you perfect
You made me question if God could be a woman

[Verse 4: Shola Ama]
I'll take you in if you fall from the sky
Take off your shoes, help you walk through the fire
If love is lust, don't you know we can find it within?
But if your run expired
Icarus, cigarettes my life
Look at this, imitate my crimes
I'm not innocent, but innocence i tried
Not innocent, but innocence i tried

[Chorus: Collard, Shola Ama]
I hope you don't see, the day they clipped my wings
I hope you don't see, the day they clipped my wings
Its been on and on, and tiresome
And I can't feel my limbs
I hope you don't see, the day they clipped my wings

I was tempted from the get
Swallowing each second guess
'Cause I had you in mind (baby)
Following your thirst and sweat
On a whim when first we met
I just had to rewind it
Got me spellbound with that face
And the way you move that waist
Thinking can I get a taste
If I keep you on my mind
Will our energies align
Or am I wasting my time

See you watching (oo oo oo oo oo)
Ain't no stopping (oo oo oo oo oo)
No more talking

See you watching (oo oo oo oo oo)

Pardon me I said
What you waiting for let's get it babe
Get it fast, get it slow (get it slowly)
Won't regret it, no

You the one I want to know
Can we disappear

I'm always runnin' into you
And when I don't I'm hopin' to
I hate feeling so confused, oh

I hate that you're perfect
No way your ass comes out so clean
Somebody's playin' tricks on me
Can't see what I wanna see
I hate that you still call me
Just when I done made up my mind
To leave your perfect ass behind
I hear you soundin' so fine

Your girl, your girl, oh

I hate that I can't tell you
Left guessing if you’ll ever know
I'm tryin' not to let it show
Mind game just to let you go
I hate that you don't want it
I hate that I'm still so sweet
As if it might change somethin'
When you're ready, you'll remember me
I hate I know your birthday
I know all of your  favorite shit
When you were talkin', I was listenin'
Yet I still can't win
And I hate that you don't call me
Like to think that we're still cool
And now I'm feelin' like a fool
Every time it rings. I hope it's you

Lay down beside me, do it again
It's never over until life ends, yeah
Lay down beside

Don't be a fool, baby I know you've changed
It's in my nature and it's okay (it's okay)
And I'll be your goddess and you a part of me
Lay down your pride, lay down with me

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
So ugly but you love me
Keep nobody else above me
And that's why I keep you around
Ain't it funny, now you're money
Act like you don't know nobody
What goes round gon' come back around

[Chorus: Charlotte Day Wilson]
It's never over until life ends
Lay down beside me, do it again
It's never over until life ends, yeah
Lay down beside me

You're my violet in the sun
You're the chosen one

Can't quit you, you're like drugs
Swear I tried to clean up
Too much shared between us
Saved my soul like Jesus
Can't quit you, you're like drugs
Swear I tried to clean up
Too much shared between us
Saved my soul like Jesus

I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

[Interlude]
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

[Outro]
She gets him (You get me)
She hugs him (You kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (You get me)
She hugs him (You kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time

237,21274,Red Clay,Charlotte Dos Santos,"[Verse 1]
Love is like the end of a rooftop
You seem to know to walk until you fall off
Oh, I didn't really want it anyway
I didn't really fall, you were just in my way
I'm careful what I wish for
And my intuition says no

[Chorus]
You were just like mud in my way
You wanted me to form you just like red clay
But I know what to throw away
And what to keep my hands on
My hands on 'cause you were oh like red clay
Ooh, red clay

[Verse 2]
Don't get it twisted, baby
Never existed, baby
No need to stress for a thing
I don't want any ring
For God's sake, by all means you do your thing
I'm doing mine and I'm doing just fine

[Chorus]
Oh, you were just like mud in my way
You wanted me to form you just like red clay
But I know what to throw away
And what to keep my hands on
My hands on 'cause you were oh like red clay

Give it all to me, I know
That it's time to be free, oh

And I'll show you, oh, when it's right

Don't let this fall by the side

240,21283,Table For Two,Elli Ingram,"[Verse 1]
Me, you, table for two
Candle between us blown by the mood
I'll take what I know
Menu's too big to try something new
Good as what I remember
But nothing great
Easy to swallow, how's your steak?

[Verse 2]
I know I'm not the right one
To be opposite you
But I'll try to keep fighting
Because I wanna see through
Is it me? Is it you? I'm a hopeless romantic
Can you teach me to love me?
Can you teach me to love you too?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't bite your tongue
Let your lips be undone
Speak up, young one
I won't let you choke
You can sip on my Coke
If you just speak up, young one
And say you love me

[Chorus]
We both know
That we dont talk in love no more
Since you started serving cold
I'll go smoke
While you stay staring at your phone
I know we should've stayed at home
Are you done?

[Verse 3]
Me, you, table for two
Bottle is empty, that's nothing new
I don't know where to look
Your eyes are too beautiful
Wish the feelings were mutual
And I made an effort to get dressed up
You look ready for a funeral

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't bite your tongue
Let your lips be your nurse
Speak up, young one
I won't let you choke
You can sip on my Coke
If you just speak up, young one
And say you love me

[Chorus]
We both know
That we don't talk in love no more
Since you started serving cold
I'll go smoke
While you stay staring at your phone
I know we should've stayed at home
Are you done?

[Bridge]
Have we become the couple dried up in the corner?
Do we still have shit in common?
Spent so long getting it wrong
But I always end up opposite you
Here at our table for two

[Outro]
We don't talk in love no more
Since you started serving cold
I'll go smoke

[Instrumental]

I'm done

We are gathered here today
To send souls to a new kingdom of liberty
Where each entity can discover lucid consciousness
In a dream state
Maintaining full activity of the mind and senses

Time won’t stand still
You better take that pill
Sooth your soul
You soon gon' see
That I ain’t that selfish
Just tryna make the most of it
Before the funeral

No, you’re not too bothered to understand
But I got you something special so take my hand

Only temporary, it's only temporary

Hey, running in the night shadow
Ooh, tryna get the gold medal
Hey, foot down on the go pedal

Feel your body melting
Down with it
Here darlin’, you can have the last bit
I hope you enjoyed the ride
I want you to feel alive
Your body and soul can shine

We have come up to this point in our ceremony
Where it is imperative to surrender our self completely
Only then can we drift freely into the sea of
Unbounded consciousness
That unifies us all

How you feeling now?
Did you get it right?
How you feeling now?
Did you hit it right?
Did you get it right?

242,21287,Melt My Heart to Stone,Adele,"[Verse 1]
Right under my feet is air made of bricks
That pulls me down and turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

[Verse 2]
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So, desperately, I try to link it with my head
But instead, I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

[Bridge]
Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up and leave me there

[Chorus 2]
Well, I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one
In love, I'm the only one in love

Is it really cheating, who says we're cheating

Don't let nobody know
Let’s keep it on the low

And as long as he don't
Long as she don't
Ain't no need to play it safe

Here we are, all alone babe
If we had a little more time, I’d take it slow babe
You can stay 'til the morning, when we wake up jump on it
It’s the way that you flaunt it, lets me know that you want it, and I
Can’t, say, no

Cause you know how I like it babe, let's do this in private baby
Keep it secret baby (let’s keep it on the low)

Privacy is golden (let’s keep it on the low)
So don't get too excited babe
Don't tell them about it baby

Don't let nobody know
Let’s keep it on the low

Little hands, little feet
Tiny heart, tiny beat
Oh, thinkin' 'bout the time we spent falling in love together
I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna deceive you
But oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh my, please don't take him away, mama
Don't take him away, oh

'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close

All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one
And they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You say you won't but you will, yes, you will

'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy

And there will be a time after you

Though these bodies are not our own
Walk tall, little one, walk tall

(Don't take my baby boy)
(Don't take my pride and joy)
Let me hold you, let me hold you
(I hope I stay close)
Can I hold you?

Whenever I called you
I couldn't say
It was only yesterday
But yesterday's so far away
What's the ETA?
Don't tell me you need me
I am estranged
And I'm over-aged
The trouble it may be
There's still a part of me
That has to know
What you have to say

[Chorus]
On and on we go
Always with the ghosts of us in tow
Stuck somewhere between a friend and foe
'Round and 'round we go
Oh, 'round and 'round again
Looking for a life beyond the end
Lost somewhere between a foe and friend
'Round and 'round again

[Verse 2]
I should have told you
Yes, I'm to blame
Oh, I took the blame
Turned it into this serenade
Oh, the mess I've made
And I should have warned you
What was in store
But I was so so sure
I wasn't haunted anymore
Not forevermore

[Chorus]
On and on we go
Always with the ghosts of us in tow
Stuck somewhere between a friend and foe
'Round and 'round we go
Oh, 'round and 'round again
Looking for a life beyond the end
Lost somewhere between a foe and friend
'Round and 'round again

[Outro]
On and on we go
Always with the ghosts of us in tow
Stuck somewhere between a friend and foe
'Round and 'round we go
'Round and 'round we go

Teniéndote cerca
Se me daña la cabeza

Ahora tengo la certeza
Que no se me han quitado las ganas
Despertar contigo en las mañanas
Pero voy buscando tu mirada
Y tus ojos, baby, no me dicen nada

Dime por qué has cambiado tanto
No ves, te estás engañando
Yo conozco en realidad quién eres
Lo sé, todavía me quieres

Hola, ¿me recuerdas?

Tal vez así lo podamo' hacer

Something, something, something must be really wrong with you
Why can't you just tell the fuckin' truth now?
Yes your mama did, she raised a fool, wow
What the fuck did you learn in that schoolhouse?
To chase them thrills, chasin' thrills

Okay, now you wanna say all that I’ve done to ya
You knew all along that I wasn't the one for you
So let's stop pretending like we were in love
We never shared anything but the drugs
We were both numb, never had anything real between us
We really must
Be smoking that crazy shit, in my city talkin' crazy shit
But you ain't know I'm a crazy bitch
And tell your lawyer that I ain't paying shit
Maybe you should chill, really in your feels
My bros really in the field
Neighborhood is really real and they don't play that here
You shouldn't say that here
You should've made it clear, my dear
You should've called me

You should've called me
Why you never call me?

How do you see me?
How do you love me?
How do you remember me?
Amaurotic nightingale
I hope that darkness keeps you well
When I can't fall asleep at night
I blindly taught myself to fight
Aw shadow man shadow box, please keep your hands up
And if you get knocked down don't forget to stand up

[Hook: Phoelix, theMIND & Cam O'bi]
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Bless the nightingale
(I pray it keep you well)
Darkness keep you well

[Verse 1: Noname]
Shadow man, shadow box, dance in the dark with me
This resurrected agony there's apathy for caskets
Everything I ever loved I lost in the magic
I claim by the river, my body delivered
When I die there's 27 rappers at my funeral
Moses wrote my name in gold and Kanye did the eulogy
Remember all the bashfulness, understand the truancy
Here I stand in front of a college dropout
My music was a church when your spirit hopped out
Met a gypsy in LA and she reading my palm tree
Mysterious situation like kissing the concrete i.e getting money
I been close to heaven, baby claim he love me
Hold me down forever, I never should have bought this halo
He waiting for me at his table
My funeral a Disney fable 'cause the king 'bout to take me home

[Verse 2: Saba]
Preach, church, tabernacle, Tallahassee sunshine
Southern is my bloodline, we know it'll come time... to go
And though I leave like alumni
I'm lying like a lullaby and quiet like my tongue tied... alone
Bury me in satin, tell the pastors say the sad shit
Same class with the whole... first row
And if ashes turn to ashes then I'm back in my first form
With a dust storm with a corner... and coke
Morbid or late, Lord give Lord take
Viva la muerte, mortal man, less love, more hate
More like mortician, we meet our fate
Funeral home lookin like a home that I used to live in
You wasn't supposed to go so soon I took it for granted
Maybe we'll meet the next life, maybe another planet
Open my soul but then it'll end with an open casket

[Verse 3: Smino]
Uh, ay, tippy-toe on a tightrope
Leaning on green and it gon be a dice roll
I'm fiendin' a feline who mindset Afeni, I got two packs for us
Gold on my gumline done got rich off my tongue
Sticky dro in the tight roll, cleaning my grievances
As a lil' heathen I sat pledge allegiance out
Never believed in y'all system, I needed more
And I done went Figaro with the finger roll
Landed wrong split my head, start leaking songs
And I'm worser than they worst, they make a nigga live forever
Flock with them birds, my heart stay lighter than a feather
It's gon be niggas boomin' at my funeral (boom-boom-boom-boom!)
Tell em play Metro Boomin' at my funeral
St. Louis taught me death could be your neighbor, stay away
Don't take the family for granted, better days await

[Hook: Phoelix, theMIND & Cam O'bi]

Darkness keep you well

250,21279,Tears Dry On Their Own,Amy Winehouse,"[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Verse 1]
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 2]
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Bridge]
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 3]
I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah

[Outro]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry

[Verse 1]
Everyday, I come late
Wash my clothes in the same sink
I don't give a damn 'bout what they think
As long as I pay rent
I don't even whine 'bout my paycheck
I know it's short, but I make ends
'Cause it could be a worse situation

[Pre-Chorus]
All that glitters ain't gold
And all that shines bright ain't a diamond
All that wrinkles isn't old
And as far as you see ain't the horizon

[Chorus]
A death in designer (Ain't everything)
To live on an island (Ain't everything)
We keep on tryin' (Why do we keep on trying?)
We'll end up dyin' (Over anything)

[Verse 2]
Everyday, I leave late
I wait out front in the same place
And I don't give a damn 'bout what they say
Long as the day ends
I made some plans with some good friends
I don't even know where the day went
But it could be the worst conversation

[Interlude]
You know there's a roach on the floor?
Right there
Ah man

[Pre-Chorus]
All that glitters ain't gold
And all that shines bright ain't a diamond (Oh-oh, ohh)
And all that wrinkles isn't old
And as far as you see ain't the horizon (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh)

[Chorus]
A death in designer (Ain't everything)
To live on an island (To live on an island)
We keep on tryin' (Why do we keep on trying?)
We'll end up dyin' (Over anything)

Part II: Nobody Carez

[Intro]
Everybody want a motherfuckin' Benz or Beamer
Designer sneakers, ain't no motherfuckin' dreamers
Shit is deeper than Neiman
Mark us on your Hollywood starlets
Underneath there's niggas starvin', impoverished
People don't give no fucks, nigga
Trump don't give a fuck
Your niggas don't give a fuck
Your favorite artists don't give a motherfuckin' fuck
Do you give a fuck, nigga?

[Interlude]
Keep playin', motherfucker

[Chorus]
If you told 'em you was down and out
Would they pull up or would they wait it out?
Would they ever call you just to talk about
Whatever they wanna talk about?
If you borrowed money 'cause it's life or death
Would they ask you for their money back?
Would they tell the world all of your business?
And this and that? Your business and this and that

[Verse]
Maybe you're too friendly or maybe you're too real
You put your time and faith in people that can't seal the deal
Trials and tribulation often force one to reveal
That maybe you just don't know what to feel
Did you know you were you with the devil last night?
Couldn't see where you was goin' with a flashlight
I know it burns, I'm just concerned (When will you learn?)
I know that you were with the devil last night
And baby, I ain't sayin' you don't act right
This world don't love but that don't mean that you can't hope it does

[Chorus]
If you told 'em you was down and out
Would they pull up or would they wait it out?
Would they ever call you just to talk about
Whatever they wanna talk about?
If you borrowed money 'cause it's life or death
Would they ask you for their money back?
Would they tell the world all of your business?
And this and that? Your business and this and that

When the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92
I listened to what my father said

[Chorus]
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can

[Verse 2]
How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said

[Chorus]
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
Oh, I, nah, nah, nah
If you are strong, you cannot fall
If you are strong, oh, no
There is a voice inside us all
So smile, ohh, when you can, ohh, when you can

[Verse 3]
If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side, woo, oh
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do

That is everything, that is everything

Don't know why, just know I want to

I'd rather be breaking things, cause we can't see

""...Difficulty however was always a challenge to William;
And he wanted Joan back, he liked Joan
She was quiet and shy, and amenable, and dependable
And he was a god in her eyes.""

There I lay
Beside the Great Dane
A stray in the south, obsessed by your mouth
And you’ve, been away for the fall
I’ve barely seen you at all
Impressions over you blew like Bikini Atoll

[Pre Chorus]
Shallow pain but it’s not deep down
Cigarettes while you’re asleep now
I’ve taken less care, I feel weak now
You said you was flying to Milan in about a week now

[Chorus]
I don’t mind to reignite the fire, besides from that weed we light and
If you try to ask me why the fact that I’ve lied and you’re tired of that
Well I don’t blame
I only claim to be in a state that closure was the way
She exposed my name
And now I’m supposed to tell you all them times and the place but

I’m still developing
Enveloped in the elephant of the room I’m already in
I don’t give a-
It’s irrelevant

Been away for the fall
Barely seen you at all
You've come and see me at school, and you’ll realize that I’m no fool

[Pre Chorus]
Shallow pain but it’s not deep down
Cigarettes while you’re asleep now
When I’m taken less care I feel weak now
You said you was flying to Ja-
In about a-
Ah no

[Chorus]
But I don’t mind to reignite the fire besides from that weed we lighting
If you try to ask me why the fact that I’ve lied and you’re tired of that
I don’t blame, I’m only claim
In a state that closure was the way
She exposed my name and shame now
Time is in their place but

I’m still developing
Enveloped in the elephant of room I’m already in
I don’t give a fuck it’s irrelevant

Been away for the fall
Barely see you at all
You come and see me at school
And you’ll realize that I’m not

Different girls with the same issues
Chains, pearls and tissues
Would you change if I claimed I miss you
Words I love you is misused
A struggle and pissed you
Just wanna cuddle and kiss you now I’m double muddled and pissed too

New dawn, new day
A reflection of our time, for Pete’s sake
Generations of mobile phones
Even though these girls hormones are most unknown
Implants, at 14, she was lookin fresh apart from her weave
I prefer natural on girls
Even when I think about you now I have to gag and hurl
But not physically
Think about you with another man it sickens me
And I’m sure that you haven’t
Even if you have, then I’m sure that I’d have him
I said I’m sure that I’d smack him
Like the end of a party everything stop happenin
Maybe her brain had mutated, even though they’re in the past she be sedated but

[Chorus]
I don’t mind to reignite the fire besides from that weed we light and
If you try to ask me why that I’ve lied and you’re tired of that
I don’t blame, I only claim to be in a state that closure was the way
She exposed my name and shame and now I’m supposed to tell you all them times and the place but

I’m still developing
Enveloped in the elephant of the room I’m already in
I don’t give a-

[Second sample from ""Just William"" by Richmal Crompton]
""Miss Eveschon was shattered but she made her way to the background
The curtains dividing the platform from a whole were drawn for no other reason than the Mr. Weastonburry enjoyed drawing them back
The clock struck 8, and Mr. Weastonburry, with his own inimitable air of providing the most important items of the evening's entertainment, drew them back
Miss Eveschon gave a gasp of horror, for there on the platform was the wooden table -the altar she supposed- and on it was Hector, her Hector, whom she had left asleep by the fire, now spirited here by some infernal means and standing motionless, not moving a muscle or twitching a whisker. Hypnotized
And behind the altar was Miss Parend, looking more witch-like than ever, hatless, her white hair falling about her face, wearing a long black coat and leaning on a stick
Then came the culmination of the horror; for the witch hobbled to the edge of the platform, looked down into the well of the hole, fixed her dim lit eye on Miss Eveschon and said in a voice that froze
The flattering Miss Eveschon...""

Something special in the deep it grows
Waters in my spirit
To his you must let go
And even when I die
Lay me by the water side and float to afterlife
To see to sea

Strength in your currents together in your arms we flow

I know sometimes the mountain's hard to climb
We walk by faith and oftentimes we're blind
""It's working for my good,"" is what they say

Why bother?
But what would a diamond be?
Without pressure?
Will the flower's seed bloom?
Without a little rain?
Oh yeah, I hear You
And I can move if I want to but I don't

They tell me that my thoughts are not your thoughts
Ways are not your ways
Still I find it hard to say to trust You
And even though I know it's not my place to the God who that made the heavens earth and space
I need You
Help me make sense of all this pain
I'm encouraged by the testimony of those that overcame
But my heart aches
For the single mamas trying to maintain
She probably not able, she got that Cain in her veins
It's like we build mountains with our own hands
And then we get mad at You because we don't understand
That it was us who strayed away
But You still had a plan
To bring us back within your fold and keep us in your hand
I know these mountains You give us is only meant to take us higher
But we love the valley so we pursue our own desires
It's a crying shame
What we do to numb the pain
When there's power in Your name
To heal the sick and heal the lame
It's like we fight against you like you ain't out here fighting for us
And all these trials and tribulations given to help grow us
It's hard, I know it is
Specially when you scared of heights
And every time you turn around
It's like you got another fight
So I pray these words I speak, the food to curb your appetite
And when the morning comes, I hope You're there so we can share the light
Until then I be sipping from the fountain
Find me on the rough side of the mountain
I'm gone

And I know what you're gonna do (what you're gonna do)

267,21316,Something In The Way,Jorja Smith,"[Verse 1]
When I left I thought I would be stronger
But in fact, it took away my energy
Hard to tell you that I could not really see
Beyond the gates of this purgatory
I am so tainted now, I cannot wash you off
The memories still don't seem to fade
When I left, did you even wash your tears?
'Cause mine have been dryin' for days

[Chorus]
Somethin' in the way
Why am I cryin' for you, babe?
Can't stand the rain
Time to move on anyway

[Post-Chorus]
Don't ask me why
It's done
So long, goodbye
I'm gone

[Refrain]
'Cause only sun in the summer lasts
No holdin' on and no lookin' back
Even the sun doesn't seem to last
It don't hold on, it's not comin' back

[Verse 2]
If I kept a hold a little longer
I would never think I'd ever get away
Don't want to say I tried to keep ya
Say love is blind, I couldn't see you change, no
Don't wanna find myself back in that place
I have wasted all my tears on fools
There was no help for me, no savin' grace
I had been tryin' for days

[Chorus]
There was somethin' in the way
Why am I cryin' for you, babe?
No I can't stand the rain
Time to move on anyway

[Post-Chorus]
Don't ask me why
It's done
So long, goodbye
I'm gone

'Cause only sun in the summer lasts
No holdin' on and no lookin' back
Even the sun doesn't seem to last
It don't hold on, it's not comin' back

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Well there was somethin' in the way
Why am I cryin' for you, babe?
I can't stand the rain
Time to move on anyway

[Refrain]
'Cause only sun in the summer lasts
No holdin' on and no lookin' back
Even the sun doesn't seem to last
It don't hold on, it's not comin' back
Even the sun in the summer doesn't seem to last
No holdin' on and no lookin' back
Even the sun doesn't seem to last
It don't hold on, it's not comin' back

When you fall in love, ah
When you fall in love, yeah

[Verse 1]
How can I defend how good it is to define
When you call it a day (Ah)
Before you've given it any of your time
A crossroad is better than a crossfire
Better than a crossfire
A crossroad is better

When you fall in love, ah
When you fall in love
When you fall in love
When you fall in love, yeah

How can I begin if you shootin' it down

How to keep up? Will it turn to bitter use?
How do I give love, when it's serving only you?

270,21306,Fine Lines,Jorja Smith,"[Verse 1]
Wait, my train won't leave for a minute
No connection delays my departure from you
Hesitating, come fall at the doors if you feel it
'Cause we're running out of time, there's fine lines to be drawn

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I see you smiling as you're talking on the phone
Hiding your messages, but I already know that
I'm not a part of your game

[Chorus]
It ain't right what you're doing to me
It ain't right, you're confusing me
Which side of the fine lines do you want me?
It ain't right what you're doing to me
Can't you see you're confusing me?
Which side of the fine line's for you and me?

[Verse 2]
Calling coins will go, but you are still on my mind
Validate your intentions, you won't be fine
On the other hand, you're charging world
Maybe you'll move in single file
'Cause I'm losing my mind, there's fine lines to be drawn

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I believed me when I said that I would row
Snakes on the ladders, so I guess it's down we go
I've had enough of your games

[Chorus]
It ain't right what you're doing to me
It ain't right, you're confusing me
Which side of the fine lines do you want me?
It ain't right what you're doing to me
Can't you see you're confusing me?
Which side of the fine line's for you and me?

[Bridge]
The doors are closing, so is this our last goodbye?
Final curtain call before the whistle blows
Tells us why I've got to leave, I've got to go
I don't want to leave, don't want to go
But it's true 'cause we both know

[Chorus]
It ain't right what you're doing to me
It ain't right, you're confusing me
Which side of the fine lines do you want me?
It ain't right what you're doing to me
Can't you see you're confusing me?
Which side of the fine line's for you and me?
It ain't right what you're doing to me
It ain't right, you're confusing me
Which side of the fine lines do you want me?

It ain't right, now you can see
Which side of the fine line's for you and me?

271,21315,This Love,Kadhja Bonet,"[Verse 1]
I'd never find a better match
I knew the fire would catch
But giving up on pairings that
Were often cavalier
You're all the friend that I could want
A caring confidant
You move to me, bravery
Embolden and renew

[Chorus]
I thought I'd loved before but now
You shown me what love really is
10,000 years or more I might
Both live and dream about this love
This love, this love

[Verse 2]
When several days keep us apart
I'll wear you on my heart
Draw the path of memories
Begin the walk alone
Oh turtle dove will we remain
We'll share the window pane
And when I wake
The day will make
A path of dreams [?]

[Chorus]
I thought I'd loved before but now
You shown me what love really is
10,000 years or more I might
Both live and dream about this love
Unless we let go
Unless we let go
I promise I will be all you need

I thought I'd loved before but now
You shown me what love really is
10,000 years or more I might
Both live and dream about this love
This love, this love

I won't get my hopes up
Baby, yeah, I know how you be (Ayy)
You don't know 'bout me
If you ain't no stranger, may'baby we can meet, yeah
Maybe next weekend
I'm free if you free
And I think you kinda sweet
Boy, you got a sweet plan, lyi'g for the reason
Heart for the faint
Yeah I like yo' body, boy, and how you claim yo' space
Let's not waste no more time
Flaunt it, boy, I know you want it
While I turn around you, watch me check up
Ooh, I'm weak, weak, weak in my knees
Baby, when I see you
Oh-woah-woah-woah

[Chorus]
Burn, baby, hold that lit
Teaching me how to hold that spliff
Loving the way you holding it
Loving the way you ride that whip
Burn, baby, I learn quick
Teaching me how to roll that spliff
Loving the way I'm winding it
If you like what you see then come get it

[Verse 2]
And now you wanna teach me 'bout Selassie I
'Bout your divine imbalance of the MENA feminine
You get me high with your naughty sensibility
Kush in the sky when you stimulate me mentally
Fire upon Babylon, righteousness prevail
You elevate my consciousness and sex drive as well
Can't you tell?
I'm here for more than just phone conversations (Ah)
I need some love, your confirmation
So if you got, flaunt it, I know you want it
I turn around and watch you check a—
And if you feeling me, roll my weed up baby
What's the issue
Come taste my flavor, darker the berry
Baby, come closer, don't be so scary
I know you want me, you know I want you
I can feel it burning in my core bringing me toward you

Burn, baby, burn, baby, burn, baby
If you can take it baby
Tell me what you know

Burn, baby, hold that lit
Teaching me how to hold that spliff

273,21304,Move On,Faye Meana,"[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted to your in control
You’re all I seem to think of when you’re not around
Always, always, always on my mind
You don’t seem to get to know much about the fact I’m losing mine
You don’t seem to notice it until we have come back around

[Hook]
Don’t you ever wonder
How the feelings started
Don’t you ever wish we
Could stop this shit and move on

[Verse 2]
Back in the day when we were young
Go ahead, deny
Life wasn’t easy but we made it out alive
Trying to keep our feet down on the ground
Now we have become those people that we didn’t wanna be
And we’ll have to do our best to get back where we wanna be

[Hook]
Don’t you ever wonder
How this even started
Don’t you ever wish we
Could stop this shit and move on

274,21302,Still,Yazmin Lacey,"[Verse 1]
When we first met, all I thought I needed love and to be loved
By you
But there's something else that I'm seeking
Outside you
'Cause there are still pieces missing of me
Could they have fell through the cracks when we became complete?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I thought it'd be different, I did
Never thought I'd know a love like this
Forever grateful that you flipped the script
Thought it'd be different, I did
Never thought I'd know a love like this
Yes, you changed the narrative

[Chorus]
Take all the pieces
Of me that you fell in love with
Didn't know loving you meant missing pieces of me
Sometimes, it does
Take all the pieces
Of me that you fell in love with
Didn't know loving you meant missing pieces of me
But it does

[Verse 2]
From then till now, I can't believe I've made strangers out of me
And you
We filled this house with love
The mortar's made from us
And I know that nothing in this moment will land
So, here are some last words
Hope you understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought it'd be different, I did
Hoping your love could heal it
Sometimes, love shows where there are holes
Thought it'd be different, I did
Hoped that your love could heal this
Sometimes, love shows there are holes

[Chorus]
Take all the pieces
Of me that you fell in love with
Didn't know loving you meant missing pieces of me
Sometimes, it does
Take all the pieces
Of me that you fell in love with
And I'll do the same, this was never in vain, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
Take all the pieces
Of me that you fell in love with
And I'll do the same (I'll do the same)
This was never, never, never in vain
Take all the pieces
Of me that you fell in love with
I'll do the same
This was never, never, never in vain

275,21305,Sango,OSHUN,"[Verse 1: Thandi]
No pressure, you don’t have to love me
Just give me some time, just make me feel lucky
When you lay with me night
And when the sun comes up to meet the light
You say that you don’t care
I’m big enough to handle it
Just play in my hair and kiss me while the candles lit
Your secrets safe with me and I won’t tell
I don't mind if you hurt me it’s my own fault that I fell
And I tell myself I need you, but you don’t feel the same
And double standards taught me I should let you play the game
But I’m not ashamed of playing the fool
Just call me beautiful
You tell me things like you'll leave her when we both know that’s not true
And make promises of the things we both know you won’t do
Boy it’s cool, I’ll crumble alone
And you gone live your life and only fuck when in the zone
And yeah you make me moan
I put you on a throne; you won’t pick up your phone
But baby you make me feel grown
So I persist to give you everything you want
Even though you kept it real with me and you been blunt
Saying that we won’t be together and this is only lust
And never equals never
I’m on the same page as you
There’s nothing that I can explain to you
To show you why

[Chorus 1: Niambi]
I just keep on giving
I cannot keep living for you
Got my mind spinning round
You gon' let me drown
But I’m sick of falling
I wanna rise to love
Rise to love
Rise

[Verse 2: Niambi]
A weak woman goes where she is smiled at
But I've never seen a smile quite like yours
Said he loves me, he loves me not
Well he’s not sure but he knows he wants me
Yeah he said I’m making him hot hot hot
And so I let him take my top off
I don’t know thinking maybe things will pop off
Or sparks from the physical signals to his mental for a certain type of spiritual relationship
But, he just want the rhythm of my hips
Placing seldom kisses upon my lips
You know that quick fix satisfaction
Bridging to nowhere, a fatal attraction
Like whoa there, why did we go there so fast?
We knew that purely matter never ever last
Now morning glass outside looking in
While your bragging bout my ass to your friends
And I know this all begins with my issues with men
That’s why

[Chorus 2: Niambi]
I keep on defending
The fact that I’m depending on you
I know it’s true that
A weak woman goes where she is smiled at
But I’ve never seen a smile quite like yours
Whether you love me or love me not
I’ll adore you forever more

[Chorus 1:]
And I’ll just keep on giving
I cannot keep living for you
Got my mind spinning round
You gon' let me drown
But I’m sick of falling
I wanna rise to love
Rise to love
Rise

Go left foot then right, c'mon, just take your time
Keep on, keep on moving, moving
Gotta get it right, I can't pause and rewind
Keep on, keep on moving, moving

[Verse]
I know, stop holding me back, quit pushing me forward
Keep on, keep on moving, moving
I move at my own pace, just leave me alone
'Cause I'm too this and I'm too that
I'm too skinny, I'm too fat
I'm all good, 'cause where I'm at I keep it moving
I'm the sweetest peach to fall, but some don't like peaches at all
I'm too short and I'm too tall, keep it moving

[Refrain]
Go left foot then right, c'mon, just take your time
Gotta get it right, I can't pause and rewind
Keep on, keep on

282,21329,Stellar,Jamila Woods,"[Chorus]
Meet me in outer space, we could spend the night
I've grown tired of this place, we could start again

[Verse]
When you look at me what do you see?
What do you see in my place?
I've been awake for 9,274 days
Your plastic pictures, tinted mirrors
Tell me nothing about myself
I've been complacent with the stories
And the lies you tell my heart

[Interlude]
So I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know even if I'll be back again

[Chorus]
Meet me in outer space, we could spend the night
I've grown tired of this place, we could start again
Meet me in outer space, we could spend the night
I've grown tired of this place, we could start again

[Outro]
Meet me in outer space
We could spend the whole night up there
I can't breathe I can't speak down here
We could start all over again

[Intro: The Manhattans & Freddie Gibbs]
It’s 2 A.M. and the place is gonna close
Yeah, time to shut it on down baby, you know what I'm sayin'?
The bartender looks as though he knows
You sure you want to do this shit tonight
Because it might hurt baby, you know what I'm sayin'?
Everybody's, everybody's been at home
Might hurt you when I
Get up in the morning and leave, you know what I mean?
Here we sit
Take that walk, you know what I mean? Yeah, uhh

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin', when I hit you up, I'm talkin 'bout bangin' something
Chill off in your crib and have a thing, probably make it stank or somethin'
Girl you like my bottom bitch, post my bail, pay for my lawyer
Play your position when them other hoes get out of order
When you wanna give me that pussy you purchase a plane ticket
Run around town when I bust her down, they want shit like them lames did it
Got her dick-whipped, my dick smeared with lipstick
Basically if this bitch lay with me, she payin' me, I'm on some pimp shit
For real, it's 2 A.M., club was 'bout to close up
Thumbing through my contacts 'bout to call one of my hoes up
Then I met you, kicked game and followed you to the breakfast spot
Fucked you like I married you that night up in the Marriott
Screaming like you got your cherry popped
Fucking, switching up positions
Thought this shit would never stop, motherfuck an intermission
Damn! (Here we are again)
Here we go again, baby, gotta take that walk now (take that walk)

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It ain't gotta be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby
It ain't gotta be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Straight slammin', sleepin' with pistols under my pillow
We wake and bake, she up naked, twistin' up cigarillos
I beat that Thursday night and Friday morning, off to work she go
Time to take that walk, just take this dick, don't take it personal
Your friends probably gonna call you a ho, what you trippin' on?
Them bitches want a grip from the same dick you be sitting on
And your girl Monique, she be hitting me when her nigga gone
Trying to buy some weed, she proceed with nothing but Vicky's on
Nothing but ass and titties, but I let that ass convince me
Took it in that, hit that, wish I could say it was accidentally
Like I stepped on a banana peel and fell in that pussy
Y'all niggas be spending all kind of scrill to get in that pussy
And she cop a seven every Friday
Chuck the deuces at her baby daddy as I pulled up out the drive-way
For real (Here we are again)
Here we go again, back in yo' pussy, nigga, you know what I'm saying?

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It ain't got to be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby
It ain't got to be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby

[Outro]
Here we are again

My cup is full up, what I got is enough
Nobody completes me, don't mess with my stuff
My cup is full up, what I got is enough
Nobody completes me, don't mess with my love
Surely, surely, surely, surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me
Shall follow me
Shall follow me

285,21338,Feel Like A Fool,Kali Uchis,"[Verse 1]
What can I do? It's just too late to reach you
Your cigarette burnt holes all through my t-shirt
The truth is such a pain, too horrible to name
They say don't blame the player but he played the game

[Chorus]
It's no fun to feel like a fool
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
Some might laugh, some might call it cruel
When you learn your baby don't belong to you

[Verse 2]
Love you for being sick and twisted
But pussy is a hell of an addiction
My heart went through a shredder
The day I learned about your baby mothers
'Cause you're a grown ass man, now you should know better
But I still run all my errands in your sweater
'Cause the truth is such a pain, too horrible to name
They say don't blame the player but he played the game

[Chorus]
It's no fun to feel like a fool
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
Some might laugh, some might call it cruel
When you learn your baby don't belong to you

[Bridge]
I can't look, closed my eyes
Can't believe it could've been mine

[Chorus]
It's no fun to feel like a fool
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
Some might laugh, some might call it cruel
When you learn your baby don't belong to you

[Outro]
No fun to feel like a fool, fool
It's no fun to feel like a fool

286,21308,Multi-Love,Unknown Mortal Orchestra,"[Verse 1]
Multi-love
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room
Who is your God, where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko
She don't want to be your man or woman
She wants to be your love

[Verse 2]
Multi-love
All of the other stalker daughters dragged her under
May all her minds be made up
I'll be her Vicodin, expired and escaped to Valhalla
She don't want to be your man or woman
She wants to be your love

[Chorus]
Multi-love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama, what have you done to me?
I'm half crazy

[Verse 3]
Multi-love
It's not that this song's about her
All songs are about her
The sun shines underneath us
Fearing new kinds of mind control and just blaming each other
She don't want to be your man or woman
She wants to be your love

[Verse 1]
Multi-love
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room
Who is your God, where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko
She don't want to be your man or woman
She wants to be your love

[Chorus]
Multi-love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama, what have you done to me?

We were one, then become three
Mama, what have you done to me?
I'm half crazy

Lonely, lonely how I be
Lonely, lonely cuts so deep
Say don't take from me my quiet
Don't take from me my tears
Don't take from me my trials
Don't take from me my fears

[Chorus: Jamila Woods]
I could be crazy
But my crazy is my own
My own, my own
You think I'm crazy
I'll be crazy on my own
My own, my own

[Verse 2: Jamila Woods]
I put a sun in my lamp
I put a post-it note on my mirror
So I might love myself
So I might be enough today
I'm not OK, thanks for asking
I can tell I've said too much I'm out of touch
Guess no one ever really wants to know

[Chorus: Jamila Woods]
I could be crazy
But my crazy is my own
My own, my own
You think I'm crazy
I'll be crazy on my own
My own, my own

[Verse 3: Jamila Woods]
I don't wanna wait for my life to be over
To let myself feel the way I feel
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
To love myself however I feel

[Outro: Lorine Chia, Jamila Woods]
A place where I'm alone
I could be crazy
Searching for a place where I belong
I get lost when I'm alone
You think I'm crazy
I get lost when I'm alone
Searching for a place where I belong
When I feel, when I feel, when I feel alone
When I feel, when I feel, when I feel
When I feel, I said when I feel
Alone, alone

[Verse 1: J. Cole & TS, J Cole]
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay (Maybe I'll stay)
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth, I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Ayy, from the door I showed you my scars
And I told you girl, ""I won't lie-ie-ie""
If we at war, then this is a war
That I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile

Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mmm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

[Chorus: Austin Feinstein]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visage 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control

[Chorus: Austin Feinstein & Yung Lean]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

Sometimes you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights, you're dancing
With tears in your eyes

Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night

Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night

You're spittin' game, know you got it (Yeah)

291,21377,Steppin',Antonio Neal,"[Intro]
Mm, mm, mm
Aw yeah, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
'Cause '88 time to set it straight, know what I'm sayin'?
And ain't no half-steppin'
Word, I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Rappers steppin' to me, they wanna get some
But I'm the Kane, so, yo, you know the outcome
Another victory, they can't get with me
So pick a B.C. date 'cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And steppin' to me, yo, that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition, I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
'Cause when it comes to bein' dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
'Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you tried to be basin'
Friday the 13th, I'ma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes, Big, not little
So define it, here's your walkin' papers, sign it
And take a walk as the Kane starts to talk, 'cause

[Chorus]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Down the road

[Verse 2]
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin'
To sound like me, so soon, I'll have to open
A school of emceein' for those who wanna be in
My field and court, then again, on second thought
To have MCs comin' out soundin' so similar
It's quite confusin' for you to remember the
Originator, and boy, do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best, oh yes, I guess, suggest the rest
Should fess, don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraphs I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stoppin' the groove until when it's
The climax and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me actin' ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, makin' it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, aw shit
I stop and stand strong over MCs
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
'Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff or get with
The man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleepin' on your rhymes 'til I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, 'cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're tryna go
When you wanna step to me, I think you should know that

[Chorus]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Down the road

[Verse 3]
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare, put him in the rear
Back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to the wannabe competition
Tryin' to step to me, must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I'm losin'? Tsk, picture that

[Chorus]
Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'
Mister Cee, step to me

[Post-Chorus]
Get on— Get on down
Get on down— down
Get on— Get on down
Down
Get on— Get on down
Get on—
Get on— Get on—
Down— (Look) Down— (Look) Down— (Look) Down—

[Verse 4]
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make MCs evaporate
The party people say, ""Damn, that rapper's great""
The creator, conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy bein' me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceedin' to my innovation
Not like the other MCs that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo, I'ma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messin' around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take your title
Namely me, because I'm homicidal
That means murder, yes, I'm out to hurt a-
-nother MC that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him and take him
And mold him and make him hold up the peace sign
As-salamu alaykum

294,21398,Thank U,Jamie Jones,"Spent so many days feeling sorry 4 me
(When) I knew there was much more that I could be
But I was just so full of uncertainty
But then I heard a voice deep inside
Telling me that fear is just a lie
And I won't let it stop me from living my life

B-Sec
So now I'm taking full control
I'll grab the wheel and won't let go
No matter where this road may lead
I won't let nothing stop me
I'll...Rise

Hook
Rise
Every time I stumble and fall
I'll rise, even when I get pushed down
I'll rise, every morning I wake up I'll thank God 4 another day
I will rise, I'm feeling stronger everyday
Rise, so high nothing's in my way
Rise, now I've got wings 2 fly and I won't be denied
I will rise

Verse
Sometimes it's hard to see the finish line
When you think you've fallen far behind
But you can't win the race unless you try
So I'll suffer and I'll struggle and I'll push hard
Knowing that end is not that far
Coz anything is possible, If you just believe

B-Sec
Life can pass you by so fast
So I'll live each day, like it's my last
And when my strength is at its end
I won't give up, I won't give in

Rise, now I've got wings 2 fly and I won't be denied
I will rise

Bridge -
I'll never fear the darkest night
I will rise
Just like the morning sun
Climbs up in the sky
I will

Everything’s a puzzle,
a mystery to me!
The shape of this toast, or
the taste of my tea!

Everything’s a riddle;
a quandary to solve!
I’ll best every test,
No matter what they involve!

We’ve got to use every clue;
till we deduce the final key!
We’ve got to plan every move
three steps ahead!

LUKE: I'm not sure you can do that…

PROF:
We’ve got to search evеry inch,
and do it mathematically!
Till we solve еvery riddle,
colossal or little,
by fiddling with things methodically!

LUKE: Professor, I don’t see how this is a puzzle-

PROF: Now now, Luke! Hop to it! That’s what a gentleman does!

LUKE: (to the cat) Don’t get used to this.

PROF:
Everything’s a puzzle!
And all that I see
awaits a solution
from someone like me!

Quantify this mayonnaise!
Finagle this cheese!
Triangulate pant-size
of this underwear please!

LUKE:
Professor, that’s well and good,
but really, have you lost your mind?
There are no puzzles to solve
beneath a skirt…

PROF: Quite astute of you!

We’ve got to crack every code,
decipher every glyph we find!
There’s no need for hints
with both our brains combined!

LUKE: Professor-

PROF:
Everything’s a puzzle!
I’m sure you’ll agree
that everything’s a puzzle
to me!

Everything’s a puzzle
to tinker and tweak!
To dig in and dissect
the source of mystique!

Every new enigma
proves veritably that
Everything’s a puz-zle
to me!

They done let them Christians in the club
Oh my God! They done let them Christians in the club (x8)

(Verse 1:)
Oh my God, look at all these Christians in the club
Look at all my fellas showin love
We done bought the bar, not what you think exactly
Tell the bartender we servin virgin daquiris
I wanna party sober, and I get a buzz off this music
Get high off the spirit, when I feel it, can't lose it
Atmosphere is crazy, everybody feel the same
And man if you ain't feeling this than you a certified lame
I came in the name of the one who sent me
Pulling up clean in an all black Bentley
Close the door gently, step out stuntin
We done covered all charges so everybody comin
Long line outside, be patient, no skippin
Extra police incase people start trippin
Leave your gun home and put your dope away
Cause you don't really need all that to party anyway

(Chorus:)
Oh my God! They done let them Christians in the club (x8)

(Verse 2:)
Can't stop em so you might as well join em
Christians walkin round acting like they're club owners
Even the DJ is with them Christians
And when he yells ""Switch! "", every Christian switches
Man, you either want to be one or be with one
And, You're trying to figure out just how to get one to come
And talk to you, have a conversation All these Christians in the
Club, tell me what's your hesitation
I see two over there, and three over there
And four in the back with their hands in the air
Unified, got much power
Laughin and giggling like it's comedy hour
My God! They done let them Christians in the club
And them Christians is talking to them thugs and showin love
And them thugs is askin and wonderin, they tryin to see
Where the party's gonna be the followin week, now we gone see

298,21360,N.F.L,Da' T.R.U.T.H.,"Never knew a love like this
Never knew a love like this
O... yeah...
N.E.W.F.O.U.N.D.L.O.V.E
We Call this Love now... Love now
Our New Found Love
Yo, I was looking for someone to love me
Hug me, trust me, like some money with a trustee
But I looked at in the wrong places, to fill the empty spaces
Of my life, but always ended up with long faces, and all the bases
Of all my relations had worldy foundations, plus some sensual sensations
Try to find love in females that I could see well
They were pulling me down to spread the rumors around like email
(So what's the big fuss?) It wasn't love, it was lust
And I must confess the devil's thrust was inconspicious
Plus the love I had was self-seeking, looking for a house I could sneak in, a dreaper for the weekend
Flesh was loving it but my soul was weak trying to fill the void with sex and that was like candy without the sweetness
All I knew was that I needed someone to love me with and God be loved and Godly love there no Super Sing!
N.E.W.F.O.U.N.D.L.O.V.E
We Call this Love now... Love now
Our New Found Love
You don't speak English, you speak the language of love
Plus you blow the mind of angels above
I can't explain it, you gave up your son just to break up the grudge
So that you and I can make up and hug
So I'm saying, He doesn't where His love loosely
Love is like Lucy
If you take advantage, He's still the judge like Judy
Doesn't love you 'cause you're a cutie
And truly not commited to you simply on the basis of your duty
If He was, then what you can do for Him
But His is love is on hinge on what he did for sin
The love I'm talking about is more than a trend
A perfect love that is passage of friend
If you were to confess wether you're tall, nose big or small
He loves you just the way you are, with your flaws and all
He sees your needs, meets you wherever you are
He love you when you're on the rise, even when you fall
It remains the same doesn't change like the leaves in Fall
He proved His love on the cross, when He streched His palms
Jesus baby
His love erased our guilt
Jesus baby
His love covered my filth
Jesus
I read about it in the book off the shelf
Jesus
He loved me when I didn't love myself
Now check the love sequel: how he love a bunch of bugged people
Prepared to place to a Joseph tailored-made his tuxedo
And marry us over the treshold carry us fabulous and I am touched of how he love us very much
And I gotta brand new found love in my life
And I gotta brand new found love in my life, Sing!
N.E.W.F.O.U.N.D.L.O.V.E
We Call this Love now... Love now
Our New Found Love
Never knew a love like this
Never knew a love like this

Staring at the clock all day
I count the clouds to past the time away
Can't wait to get home to see your pretty face
I thought about a thousands things
Sometimes I catch myself wondering
Is this really real or is it just a dream?

[Chorus]
I can't see myself without you (Oh Lordy, mmm)
I'd rather be by myself (I love so many things)
I love so many things about you (Yes, I do)
It's all about you, no one else

[Verse 2]
I'm thinking back to when there was no us
All I remember what a mess I was
Never thought I'd be the kind of man to ever settle down
Girl, it's more than just physical
I go as far to say it's spiritual
It's the kind of love, love that outlast life, ooh, ooh, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You love me just for me
Give me just what I need
More than enough to make me happy
It's no coincidence (No coincidence), together ever since
So evident (And that's why I can't)

[Chorus]
I can't see myself without you
I'd rather be by myself (Rather be by myself, oh)
I love so many things about you (Many things about you, girl)
It's all about you (All about you, yeah), no one else (Oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Sometimes we be going through, that's just how lovers do
Still we're together stuck like Krazy Glue
If I ever thought that we'd never part
I might as well give up on love 'cause you have my whole heart

[Chorus]
I can't see myself without you
I'd rather be by myself (If I'm not with you I'd rather be by myself)
I love so many things about you (Oh Lordy, mmm)
It's all about you (Baby, I love you so much), no one else
(I need to be with you)
I can't see myself without you (Yes, I do, oh, oh)
I'd rather be by myself (I'd rather be by myself)
I love so many things about you
It's all about you, no one else

300,21380,Been so Good,Lavie,"I Remember When
You Left Me All Alone
So I Sent You Straight to Voicemail
Even the neighbors were saying
Lately, you've been acting kind of shady
Been hugged up with another lady
Oh yeah, I ain't finna lose my cool
Over a nigga who
Is so used to being cool
Wants to bend all of the rules
Refuses to tell the truth
That's cool, my nigga, do you
I'll no longer play fool to you

I refuse to let you play
Play my heart like a game
Ride it just like a wave
Get me all in my feelings
And dance on them like a grave
Never thought that loving you would bring me this kind of pain
But you just had to have your way
Now you want me to stay, tell me how much you changed
You lost me when you crossed me, baby
You should be so ashamed
You're so stuck in your ways
And now all I have to say is

[Hook 1]
Pick your shit up, boy this is goodbye
I can't take another sleepless night
You can't have your bitches on the side
They say numbers don't lie
And baby boy, you're not the one (so goodbye)
Baby boy, you're not the one, no
(No, no, no) Baby boy, you're not the one

I remember back when we were happy
I remember when you always had me
I remember all the times you told me
That you would never leave me lonely
There were no yous before me
That I was your one and only
I can't believe that you would ever make me feel
Like all of my love was for nothing
I can't believe you'd rather creep while I was sleep
And show those girls the world
Then turn around and tell me that it wasn't nothing
How could you be, you are so weak
You never felt a love so deep
Until you gave your heart to me, boy
But now I see that it wasn't meant to be
So just take your shit and leave
Leave your keys and take your ring, boy

[Hook 2]
Pick your shit up, boy this is goodbye
I can't take another sleepless night
You can't have your bitches on the side
They say numbers don't lie
And baby boy, you're not the one
Baby boy, you're not the one, no
(No, no, no) Baby boy, you're not the one

[Bridge]
I helped you down, oh
But you played me
Now myself I found (Found)
And now you need me
You let me down (You let me down, now)
You deceived me
Now who's lonely now (Who's lonely now)

[Hook 3]
Through thick and thin
I've been by your side
Had me thinking
You were on my side
When all this time
It was all a lie
They say numbers don't lie
And baby boy, you're not the one
Baby boy, you're not the one, no
(No, no, no) Baby boy, you're not the one

301,21373,The Only One,Antonio Neal,"You mean more to me than any words could say
You illuminate my path and lead the way

In your secret place is where i want to be
In your presence is everything that i need
You are my life, my love

(chorus)
You are the only one i need
You are the only God for me
I cannot move, cannot breathe
Unless You exhale in me

It is so sweet to know that you have drawn so close
And in return i lay my life down at your feet
Your desire is the song i want to know
You are my song, my melody

You are my shelter, my comfort and peace
Your words I rely on Jesus, reveal your truth in me
You're my strong tower, Your refuge I seek
Bright and morning Star, I want to be where you are

Lord,I adore you and I bless your name

Today, I know better than to say what I'll never do (Never do)
Life had to put me on my knees
Humbled, speechless
And you see me with love and meekness
Tell me You'll never cast away my confidence
Because Your grace is sufficient for the consequence
Lord, I just don't wanna hurt you
Gotta a lot to work through

[Verse 2]

Today, I'm going to add to my faith some virtue (virtue)
Time to be a doer of Your Word
To know is to love You
And to love You is to feed your sheep
True enough, I struggle to keep, publishing peace
Some many have yet to believe
With fear I tremble, at the thought of Your stare
We own this frail understanding of God's love
Not enough to lean on
He owns time
Eons believe on Him
Our lives should be spent on trying to discover
But it seems like, (Yeah) evil is always right there
Givin' it too much credit, just a little bit too much credit
Forget it, it's behind you

I remember when we used to hit the RiverGate Mall
We ain't even had no pesos we was still tryna ball
Hit my homie with the alley oop, shots fall
Now we in the kitchen cookin' with the wrist wrist, nevermind
Treat it like a game it was never hard to find
In the food court, quick to pull up on a dime
Where you from, what's your name
Can I have yo number I'ma do the same

[Hook - Sean C. Johnson]
Automatic with the bate
We was cookin' now we owed somethin'
Insane just to think
All the hearts that we broke for nothin'
All the tears all the pain
Some stuff ain't worth discussin'
Yeah we young and we dumb
But some of us never grow up
Now we off to the races
Triple-X done raised us
Hundred-thousand faces
None of them ever measure up
We just scroll to the next
Break it off in texts
Leave the next with a mess
Set a [?] (wrist, wrist)
What you doin'
Cookin', cookin' up
Cookin', cookin' up (where you been homie?)
Cookin', cookin' up
Cookin', cookin' up

[Verse 2 - Sean C. Johnson]
'93, I was out here cookin' like I had the key
Woe is me, way before the bae was jumpin' shoot the three
Don't believe? Alpha and omega put that on a G
I might mess around and get to flossin' up in Applebees
2 for 20 I could see the game clear 20/20
If you're hearing rumors 'bout me
Don't just spread them bring 'em to me
2 or 3 might be true
I just brace for the news
Nothin' else I can do (young man don't lose yourself)

Uh, I remember way back when
I was like 10 with my accent
Wasn't in the trap I was in the flash
Little jet on my back then
Started learnin' how to mack when
Saw the old ones do it
I was so into it not the only student in the building
We were building home improvement and my single unit
Wasn't whippin' in the kitchen
But me and shorty we was with it
I was handlin' some business
But now I'm asking for forgiveness
'cause I'm deep up in the trenches
I see a better way of livin'
'nother way to get in love one woman
[?]
Ain't got time to play around I fidget for real
If anybody wanna know
We love each other when the mic low
And we don't do it for the show
So stop singing out life goals
Yeah, and I'd rather love one woman then a hundred though
That's one woman when the fun is high and one woman when the sun is low
Look, I done broke a lot'a hearts and mine broke and fell apart
Put it together like art
Only had it broke yet again in the car
What they teachin' you is false
How you thinkin' that you small, homie you should start
Don't play now play your part
Go back in the kitchen whip another bar for real

I was broken until I got to the potter
I was alone no one could help me out
I was empty and dry
Until the rain fell down

So where do we go from here?
Lost in the middle of nowhere close to home
And I can hear your voice so clear
Saying come to where you are
So I'm running

Cause I need living water
I'm coming back to the well where we first met
I need living water, pour yourself in me
Cause you are all I need
Living water

Moving fast, through life
Tryina be the best I can
Outside, while forgetting what I need to last
This time would you lead me and hold my hand?

So where do we go from here?
Caught in the middle of somewhere close to home
And I can hear your voice so clear
Saying come here where you are
So I'm running

Cause I need, living water, I'm going back to the place
Where we first met

On a mountain top

306,21357,What A Friend,Sean C. Johnson,"[Intro: Dillon]
But even stars collapse
This world is a black hole, sucking the life out of everything

[Verse 1: Dillon]
Uh - this probably how chaos feels
I just want him to stay off pills
Wish that I could look him in the face
And not feel all the rage instilled
Maybe we’ll come face the real
Until that happens I can’t be still
Avoid the topic -my joy is gone cus'
I don’t even know how to pray for real
I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say
These black holes they stole away
The goal of days spent in golden ways by a father figure
With his soul displayed
Prayed for years, with [crazy] tears, but I feel like your answer is “No”
He has cancerous soul
You could advance him and ransom his whole being
Why you gotta take away his sobriety?
Why couldn’t you take away his addiction?
Why am I waiting for You to respond to me
Feel like You already made ya decision -I’m frustrated!
And God, I’m fighting through the tough stages
To believe You’re just gracious, and You call on me to love patience
The weight of a fallen world collapsed on top of my spirit
Is breaking my heart I’m sure of that, I want your appearance
At least that’s what I thought today
Could be a price I don’t want to pay
Cus' what if You don’t show up until you take it all away

[Chorus 1: Sean]
I'm crying out
Praying You can hear me
Got me on my knees
If you will God, can You take this cup from me?
Pray for miracles
Ain’t been one that I can see
My lifetime
I'm staring down this black hole

[Verse 2: Dillon]
I got scars too
I got heart wounds
I cannot develop dreams into better things in the dark room
Enough about me
I got brothers
His thoughts suffer, his soul aches
Shares a scary song
Tears began to fall
Barely hanging on most days
And another friend with a different face is
Getting a bit impatient
He has not seen his kid in ages
He has missed so many stages
No Little League, no Christmas plays and
Birthdays, or big vacations
Wants to go back to prison cages
At least then he had visitation
And I’ve seen Daddies get their time taken
I know women who feel like God hate 'em
Because after her third miscarriage
Her world did perish and that's when she stopped praying
A husband buries his wife, at her grave he said;
“Who will teach little Gracie [] to shave her legs?
God, on my own, how will I raise these kids;
Is the road marked with suffering
Where my Savior lives?”

[Chorus 2: Sean]
I'm crying out
Praying You can hear me
Got me on my knees
If you will God, can You take this cup from me?
Pray for miracles
Ain’t been one that I can see
My lifetime
I'm staring down this black hole

[Verse 3: Dillon]
But then comes Jesus, He knows how to deal with doubters
His spirit is equipped to kill the coward that doesn’t belong
In men of God
And He says
I had mercy on the bloodthirsty when I was slaughtered for you
You are the clay - I am the potter, the God who formed you
How can you argue for human beings made in My image
Your finite concept of justice does not balance the scales of
Eternity
No one dies in vain
Righteousness will reign
One day all the world will see
And the very fact that you struggle and doubt me
Only means you heard about me
Now how did you hear about Me if I never left that tomb?
I hear your cry I’m not deaf to you
Don’t let doubt and death consume
And young man - hold to what the Holy has said
And never argue with the One who walked on water, and rose from the dead
So I put this bullet of praise, into this chamber of faith
Take aim, shoot
Until doubt doesn’t remain

Please don't take your joy from me
Brand new mercies I can see
You so, so faithful to me
Now and forever

(Chorus)
Oh, all I can offer
Is my devotion to you
For your are faithful
And you are the one that loves me the most

(Verse 2)
I'm so grateful you had pardoned me
Sin and shame no longer do I see
Were so many possibilities
I tried it on my own
Don't know what I was thinking, I'm wrong
'Cause you give hope that I can see tomorrow
And strength to endure what may lie ahead
Who am I to deserve favour?

(Bridge)
I'm so grateful, grateful
You saved a wrench like me

(Refrain)
Please don't take your joy from me
Brand new mercies I can see
You so, so faithful to me
Now and forever
Please don't take your joy from me
Brand new mercies I can see
You so, so faithful to me
Now and forever

308,21367,But God,Isaac Carree,"(feat. James Fortune)
Ha ha ha, you know people have no idea what you went through to get to where you are
So many times it seemed like it was over, but God. Isaac Carree, tell em about it
Every time I think that I'm all by myself, I just look up in the sky and that's where I find my help
You might think that you got it all worked out and you think that everything's okay
There ain't nothing that you done to deserve His mercy, and His grace
(He gives us what we don't deserve, that's why we say it's amazing.)
You were bout to lose everything, but God (I know I'm not the only one who's been there)
When the doctor said any day, but God (He made the doctor)
And the devil tried to test your faith but God (He thought he really had you this time)
But God, yeah but God. Nobody but GOD. But GOD!
Give me one good reason why you should still be alive
That accident you passed last night was meant to take your life
It would have been you in the grave, you could have been with the pain
When the judge said twenty to life, should have been calling your name, but God
There ain't nothing that you done to deserve His mercy, and His grace
(Can I get a witness on that? Thank ya Isaac.)
You were bout to lose everything, but God
When the doctor said any day, but God (then you went back and he couldn't find nothing!)
And the devil tried to test your faith, but God
(If ya grateful for a but GOD in your life.)
But God, yeah but GOD, nobody, but God, but GOD
Just know that there ain't no situation that you've come out of on your own (He's always been right there wit ya)
Right in the middle of the last don't mean your life
Might have thought that you were by yourself, but he was right there by your side
You were bout to lose everything, but God (In the hospital with your baby)
When the doctor said any day, but God. And the devil tried to test your faith, but God
(you thought it was over) But God, yeah but God, nobody, but GOD, but GOD!
And to every survivor listening, who's ever been counted out and even canceled out
And your situation may have looked impossible and now people are looking for an explanation on how in the world you made it through what you went through
I don't want you to let everybody in all your business, but I just want you to look at them and give em the short version of your testimony and just tell em, you know what, it was nobody, BUT GOD!

Hey Miss Amazing, you blow my mind
Beautiful Lady, if you don't mind
I'd like to get away, sunset in view
Stay here forever on the Isle of You
I'll hold you dear
Give you your roses while you're still here
You take my breath away, my words are few
Just know forever, I love you

[Verse 1: Christon Gray]
And Lord knows, I deserve nothing
But I've got everything, yes I do

Let me tell you about the way you make me feel

You've got such a natural perfume, love
Smile like a spring afternoon, yeah
Oh, serving you is what I live for
What a joy it is to hold you in my arms; Thank You, Jesus
In the age of marriage we can take our time
Honeymoon is over, but honey, sun still shines
Some things really last forever
Like our love
Each day is like a rose, I suppose we should grab it
Smell the tenderness of intimate passion
And every rose has thorns
But we can bleed together
Looking in your eyes, during pain and happy times
The spring of laughter dies, just know
You take my breath away, oh yes you do
I'll always treasure the Isle of You

[Bridge: Christon Gray]
You are my heart until the day that death do us part
I am staying on the Isle of You
So take me where no one else can go
You are my garden I'll help you grow
Until forever I love you

[Verse 3: Christon Gray]
I'm gonna love you
For the rest of my life I'm gonna be right by your side
Oh baby, lets learn together
Learn together
Just a little bit of loving in the making everyday baby
And I'm going to cherish it until I'm gone
Just think of me as your soldier I'll always fight for ya darling
I want you to be everything God made you to be
So I'm staying on the Isle of You

312,21395,Superstar,Tye Tribbett,"[Verse 1]
Forget about the cars, the Bentleys with the rims
It's not about the clothes, the baggy jeans, and Timbs
Forget about the house, the mansion on the hill
With the swimming pool in the back and the barbecue on the grill
Forget about fortune, forget about the fame
See it's not about money or people screaming my name

[Chorus]
I just love You, oh Lord I just love you for who You are
That's all, that's all
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar
That's not why I'm singing this song

[Verse 2]
Some people just love You for the things You've done
And some just love You for all the victories won
Now there's nothing wrong (nothing wrong) with that kind of praise (kind of praise)
But this time around, I love You is all I wanna say
I got one more verse before I end this tune
See, I can go on and on like Erykah Badu

[Chorus]
Cause I just love You, oh Lord I just love You for who You are
That's all, that's all
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar

[Verse 3]
Now if you never bless me with material things
(Like what?) Like the furs and the diamonds and the Escalade or the rims
See You would still be God and that's enough for me to love You
Hey, I love You, Lord

[Chorus]
Cause I just love You, oh Lord I just love You for who You are
You mean more than this world to me
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar
That's not why I'm singing this song

[Bridge]
I love You, Lord and here's the reasons why
You gave your life, You didn't have to die
Everytime I think about it I just cry
As I long as I live you'll be glorified
I know I don't pray just as much I should
I know I don't read just as much as I could
And if I ask you to forgive me Lord I know You would
Tryin' to end this song but You've been so good to me
You mean more than this life to me

[Chorus]
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar

You mean more than life to me, You're everything I need
You supply all of my needs
The list goes on and on
I just love You
I'm tryin' to end this song but You've been so good
All I can say is...

I don't care what they think about me and

But being with you, being with you

Honey don't go, don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture and off of the screen

From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

[Verse 2]
People can change, they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be, that like love I am blind?
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

[Pre-Chorus]
One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

[Chorus]
I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay

Being with you
Being with you
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you
I wanna be with you
I don't care if they start to avoid me

314,21449,I Used to Love Him,Ms. Lauryn Hill,"[Intro]
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurried my sight
And I used to love him

[Chorus]
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige & Lauryn Hill]
I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain)
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
See, torn and confused, wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated, I waited, debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no then I just should have heeded
Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn

[Chorus]
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill & Mary J. Blige]
Father you saved me and you showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans
See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold, see, I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his, the life which was his to begin with

[Chorus]
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Outro]
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
See, I used to love him

315,21435,Now I Get It,Lisa McClendon,"Just another day that the Lord
Has kept me from falling

Just another day the Lord has helped me
To walk in integrity
Cast down my enemies

Just when I thought it was over
""I know I'm free"", is what I said to myself
But when I wasn't looking
The same test taken, tried to ruin me

But before I could make a mistake
God came and made a way of escape
Now take a good look at me
I've got a testimony

Just another day that the Lord
Has kept me from falling

It sounds familiar, I know it do
See, the same thing may have happened to you
But don't you count it strange
See, the devil ain't change
If you know what to do

Submit yourself unto God
Resist the devil, he's got to depart
And don't you let him make a fool of you again

Just another day that the Lord
Has kept me from falling

You may get weak
God knows your heart
He won't put more on you than you can bear

Just another day that the Lord
Has kept me from falling

323,21433,Pause,Lisa McClendon,"[Couplet 1]

J’ai juste envie d'me poser, juste envie d'reposer ma tête
M’envelopper d’un plaid, pendant 5 minutes apprécier
Juste un court instant le dos au fond d’un dossier
Les 2 jambes sur un repose-pied, juste relaxer
Ecouter du bon son, pourquoi pas méditer ?
Allez j'balance ma playlist, celle qui sait m’édifier
Anita Wilson, Israël Houghton, Trip Lee, Jackie Perry, Lisa McLendon
Arrive le son de Tasha avec sa voix qui résonne
En une vibe, elle te fait savoir qu’ici, mon gars, on décolle
Juste faire une pause-café, chocolat chaud
Bien au chaud avec mon plaid pour m'cacher
Du froid intempestif qui, bien sûre, tout gâcher
Je voulais un temps de pause, me voilà bien engagé


[Refrain 1]

S’il y’a un temps pour tout
Vient celui de mettre pause sur ce qui enlève nos sourires
Enfin je peux me construire cet univers
Et jouir de toutes ces choses dont je dispose
Qui a dit que l’on n'pouvait pas créer notre monde parfait ?
Le temps de secondes, l’instant d’une minute
Et même des heures durant


[Couplet 2]

Toujours sur mon sofa, toujours bien installé
J'me projette dans une voiture ne sachant pas où aller
Peu importe tant que j'peux m’évader
Evacuer le stress du jour en l’envoyant balader
Cheveux aux vents, du moins c'que j’ai sur le crane
Je m’ambiance très légèrement avec du ""Daddy"" de Morgan
Du Adé Marya, un peu de Dena Mwana
Pour m’aider à bien contempler l’éclat du panorama
J’oublie la version, la version dramatique
De la vie ici-bas et de ses mathématiques
Faire un entracte est devenu ma thématique du jour
Et franchement, ce truc est thérapeutique
Juste faire une pause, une mini
Accompagné d’un thé à la menthe genre Marrakech Mint
Me projeter dans un futur bien avant-gardiste
Avec en fond musical, les bons sons d'ma tracklist

[Refrain 2]

S’il y’a un temps pour tout
Vient celui de mettre pause sur ce qui enlève nos sourires
Enfin je peux me construire cet univers
Et jouir de toutes ces choses dont je dispose
Qui a dit que l’on n'pouvait pas créer notre monde parfait ?
Le temps de secondes, l’instant d’une minute
Et même des heures durant

Feel real good today this is the day that the Lord has made
Hey now
Put a smile on my face and know that everythings gonna be okay
Hey now
Gotta sing my song keep it, keep it rocking til the break of dawn
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Today is a new day
Forget about the drama from yesterday
Frustration don't pay
So cast all the negative things away
See everything got lighter after I prayed
And I said god just go ahead and do yo thang
Cause I'm not the same woman I was yesterday, naw
There's a time to laugh and a time to cry
A time to be born and a time to die
There's a time to kill
A time to heal
A time to tear it all down
And a time to build
But right now I'm gonna laugh myself to life
Live life to the fullest cause I'm feeling alright
And I'm not gonna cry tonight
But I'm gonna change my shoes and dance tonight
Keep it coming...

327,21442,Dreamworld,Robin Thicke,"I would be you, you would be me, we would be one, we would be just fine
The ice caps wouldn't be melting and neither would I
I would just drive my big old car, and everything would be alright
And energy would just fall down right from the sky, yeah

Words would fly right from out of my mind, out of my mind into your heart, into your life
And everything would sound just right, and no one would stop me from drinking my wine

That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, it's more than a dream
My dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, and I wanna live in my dream, (dream)

For the real world just don't feel right
I wouldn't spend my days searching for, searching for lost time (ooh ooh, dream)
I wouldn't be so damn sensitive, I'd let things go by
No matter what the weather, I'd learn to change, I'd change with the time, yeah he

And every time I need a woman, she'd appear right by me
She hold me tight, treat me right, and tell me that everything is gonna be, is gonna be alright, alright

That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld

I would tell Van Gogh that he was loved, there's no need to cry
I would say Marvin Gaye your father didn't want you to die (dream)
There would be no black and white, the world just treat my wife right
We could walk down in Mississipi and no one would look at us twice
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, it's more than a dream
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, and I wanna live in my dream

Tomorrow may never come
For you or me
Life is not promised
Tomorrow may never show up
For you and me
This life is not promised

I ain't no perfect man

I ain't no perfect man

With what it is I have

Put my heart and soul into this song (yes yes)
I hope you feel me
From where I am, to wherever you are
I mean that sincerely

You better hold this very moment very close to you (right now)
Very close to you (right now)
So close to you, So close to you (your moment in history is right now!)
Don't be afraid, to let it shine

My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see

Shine your light for the world to see
(Want black people to be free, to be free...)

Sometimes I get discouraged
I look around and, things are so weak
People are so weak
Sometimes
Sometimes I feel like crying
Sometimes my heart gets heavy
Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away (fly fly fly, like a dove)
Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself (ow!)
Passion takes over me
I feel like a man
Going insane
Losing my brain
Trying to maintain
Doing my thang
Hey hey hey hey hey
Put my heart and soul into this y'all
I hope you feel me
Where I am, to wherever you are (ha ha ha ha)
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered
Sometimes I just want a quiet life, with
Me and my babies, me and my lady
Sometimes I don't want to get into no war
(Black people to be free, to be free...)
Sometimes I don't wanna be a soldier
Sometimes I just wanna be a man, but

Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
(I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free)

Oh black people to be free, to be free, to be free
Oh black people to be free, to be free, to be free

That's all that matters to me (x7)

Black people unite and let's all get down
Gotta have what
Gotta have that love
Peace and understanding
One God, one light
One man, one voice, one mic
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and get down
Gotta have what
Love, peace and understanding
One God, one voice, one life
One man, gon' shine my light

329,21409,Show Me How to Love,Debra Killings,"[Verse 1: Big Gipp]
Why is it you fail, to see a man
In the same hour, that his kin come grinnin?
In another code, fell asleep, party mode, tryin to come up
From the ashes that defy your lift, listen up
Ladies seem sweet, the ocean meets the mountain peaks
Stone-walker, the side-walker, watches loose lips, Wall Street
Numbers set by stock movers, buy my tip so I can touch
Not for no print size, plate saint, white wasted H20
Four coats'll make it glaze
Beams rooted like dogwood, between the Pine, wind
Twenty-fo' stores with malt for sale, still fetchin water
Out the well, help em size, find the grind, find the times
Where the times weighed as hard as ? find me shoes, dead beat daddies
Rico dead, he didn't make the TV
So why should I weep, man gon' bye, see you when my light blow
Got more good than dirt to throw, and I won't pull
Between the halo, and a fork-pitch
Suffocated by my rhymes...

[Hook: Debra Killings]
Rest your mind in distant wilderness
Take your time and concentrate on it
Take a stand and make your hand a fist
We got a reason to resist

[Verse 2: T-Mo]
The mortal originator, don't cross the fader
Chillin in Decatur, where it's greater, secure streets
In the hood late at nights, dippin fine
Hard not to be slippin, if they come, I won't run
When it's time, I ain't trippin, I got my date
And you got yours too, I see, the record sales soar
After the death, of this creator, genocidal, tendencies
When they mention He, who listens to unseen hand
Slapping the faces of the young black man, when they sing
Knowin that we Godly, got to keep it right
With my people cause I'm equal no matter, how much I make
I can't escape fate, the date as I await
As I await, I can't fake
Can't fake, I can't fake, I'm true with it

[Verse 3: Khujo]
A duffel for the cash, platinum within myself from another earth
Spill, nina, tea leaf, your very, existance
Is considered a privelege, buck up, and they can't, be revoked
Pay your taxes, uhh, snake eyes
Strapped with flaws, still ignorant to a lot of laws
Man-made, but that's a dot
Everybody from the East coast done went back home, to think
Gettin they thoughts mixed negative, after reoccurances
I say a prayer, plus if I, entertained them
It's easy to commit, hard to resist
And once we cross that line segment, not even our producers
Can bring us back, eyeballs peeled
Eardrums opened, egos stripped stroked
Another low blow delivered to the hip-hop culture, uhh
Industry consists of thieveries, prostitutes
And vultures if somethin bigger than us, past the blue
Told us that it wasn't a heaven for G's
Then we do this, continue your devilish deeds
I mean activities, that just show, that it's a Hell
For Jacks, independent, but you distributed by your masters
Labels still a slave, but you just get to eat at
The white man's table, lookin like Gable Gunther
On the Guinness Book of World Records, God didn't like ugly
And he wasn't too fond of cute either
A climate of caution, a climate of caution in effect
Hard acts to follow

[Hook]
Rest your mind in distant wilderness
Take your time and concentrate on it
Take a stand and make your hand a fist
We got a reason to resist

[Verse 4: Cee-Lo]
Where ever I am, you can feel God is present
In the midst of darkness if you spark up bet somebody gonna see it
It is necessary for me to speak these words now
Another day here hasn't been promised to me, don't you agree
That you never fail when you try, I'm willing to die but first
I am willing to live, and I overstand that this will be
A lifelong sacrifice, in order to reveal
You gon' have to destroy, and if you ain't thinkin right
You damn sure can't act right, somebody raise your fist
And let me know I'm not alone, revolution, doesn't mean fightin
In these streets, and it ain't gonna be no revolution
Without the women, and, it ain't gonna be no future
Without the children, and, it ain't gonna be no children
Without the men, and, you can't have no love without the trust
And no, trust can come without communication
And you can't communicate if you ain't got shit to say
You can't teach about what you, been deceived about too
Any book you read is still limited education
You gon' have to talk to God personally and time is short
And, he's on his way, and I will receive a great reward for what I've done
And this is all that really matters to me
In time you will see what I told you is true
And I ain't have to rhyme to say that to you
I ain't got to rhyme to say it to you, it's true

[Hook]
Rest your mind in distant wilderness
Take your time and concentrate on it
Take a stand and make your hand a fist
We got a reason to resist
"
330,21408,Surrender,Debra Killings,"Every morning when I wake up
In the evening when I go to bed
Thank you Lord because he's keeping me
Safe from even things that I cannot see
He's a father, He's a brother
And His spirit is a friend of mine
And He sent me here to talk to you
He wants you to know that He loves you too

Bridge:
(Anything that you need) He's got it
(Everything that you want) You'll find it in His word
That let's you know that it can be yours
Anything you ask for
(If you know like I know) â€"" you feel it in your soul
(If you feel it in your soul) â€"" that empty space inside of you
Let Him fill you up
Now put your hands up â€"" Surrender

Chorus:
If you never felt like this before
If you know He's brought you through the storm
Raise your hands up to the sky
And tell Him I surrender
If you know that day you should've died
But His mercies brought you out alright
Raise your hands up to the sky
And tell Him I surrender

Without His love I wouldn't be here
Wraps me up till I have no fear
He's been what you need all through the years
Even as a child when it wasn't in
He protects me and He keeps me
And there's nothing that I'll ever need
That He hasn't already done for me
Even as far as my eyes can see

(Bridge)

(Chorus)
When you catch yourself a back up (God'll say I miss you)
Baby boy where have you been?
(Little girl He still loves you) He hasn't changed His mind
(One guarantee He comes back, He'll be standing for you)
Till when you called His name
That night when you whispered â€"" (I surrender)

(I surrender oh â€"" oh) I surrender â€"" I surrender oh oh
(I surrender oh - oh) Oh oh
Lord forgive me, I surrender

(Chorus Repeat 1x)

You know, baby
I know you think we can make it all work out
But I gotta tell it like it is
And I don't wanna make this any harder than it needs to be
So don't cry

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna see your tears
Baby, it'll be ok
Don't wanna see you cry darlin'
No way
(Ah)
But it just don't feel the same
(Just don't feel the same)
I know what you're about
(I know what you're about)
And I guess that I don't love you anymore
And I'm sorry, but it just ain't working out

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, it just ain't gonna work out
(Just ain't gonna work out, girl)
I'm sorry, it just ain't gonna work out
(Just ain't gonna work out, girl)

[Verse 2]
Don't want you to be sad, girl
Don't want you to be afraid
I know that you will understand my ways, one day
(Ah)
No need to be upset, girl
(You just don't understand)
Please don't scream and shout
(Please don't scream and shout)
I know that you were hearing wedding bells
But I'm sorry, 'cause it just ain't working out

I'm sorry, it just ain't gonna work out

I'm sorry, it just ain't gonna work out

332,21400,Change,Tunnel Rats,"[Verse 1: Zane One]
The chain continues for centuries long
Severs from a crippling disease of the mind
Linked together in a soul low redemption song
Just to relieve ourselves of the bind
Word from fuzz said natural instincts got I doing wrong
The less free I am, the more intertwined
Hip to Psalm 21, Matthew, Hosea and John
These anchored lines twisting me back up into the vine
Leading me back on my journey to naturalize on
While coils of bitter sweet wrapped around my throat to imbibe
Family ties choke out values, regrets of where they went wrong
Divided on my own holdin' on redirecting to God
Settlin' on an iron strong sense of where I belong
Snapped the line cutting curses from the roots inside
Said I'm changing for my sister, changing for my aunts
Breaking the chains for my daughters, I'm changing for my moms

[Hook: Zane One]
(Change)
Said my people need to, I said my sisters need to
I said my brothers tell me why the police just can't change
Music needs to, said now hip-hop needs to
Said the church needs to change
'Posters need to, I need to
I said my crew needs to, I said my family needs to
Politicians need to change

[Verse 2: Zane One]
To all my poets and freaks, peace
I'm here to honor the beats see in the 40s
Literary kingniks mixed imaginary jazz to modern prose
Their philosophies impose changeability
Dharma burns evolved to hippies
Latter 60s, big bro and rock 'n' roll
From one man's perception the voice that caused a reaction
In people who fought for it to happen when change was unacceptable
Now suppose you could modify the changeless
Rearrange for lack of sameness
Exchange to receive greatness or deeper soul
Angelou and Kerouac extract the abstract in language
Better the mad and the strangest, pure and spontaneous
Confessional impressions of personal pain
Didn't use conventional English sentences to explain
Holy slang, no thought to pause, merge text to sound improvise
Ad-lib young poets change over your false methods and lies
Some say the prose of the past is the hip-hop of today
Agreed in freestyle but in content and mentality
Sucker rhymers need to change

[Hook: Zane One]
(Change)
Teachers need to, students need to
Rock 'n' roll has to change
People need to change, lives needs to
I said now music needs, radio needs to change
Gangstas need to change, LA needs to
I said New York needs to, I said this country needs to change

[Bridge: Zane One]
Changing for my brother, I'm changing for my son
Breaking the chains for my father cause we must succumb to change
Said we could all achieve this
Death ain't no problem if we all united, change
It can be violent, it can be pain
It's change, it's all the same
Notice that time will waste if you complain
Embrace the change
Ain't no runnin' from and ain't no escape
Just watch the sun rise, the moon shines soon
Your momma, father, inner vision it needs to proceed
No further church or prestige in the waves of change

[Outro: Macho & Raphi]
(Change)
My people need to, ayo this city needs to
I can't understand or figure out why people don't
Ayo my family needs to, I say this country needs to
These weak songs they be playing on the radio should
And yo the system need to, these wack styles gotta
These fake pounds and fake smiles people giving me should
(Change)
Your attitude needs to, your work ethic needs to
The things you want need to, the way you thought needs to
The way you treat people like they less than equal needs to
Change

Wake up all the teachers, time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say
'Cause they're the ones who's coming up
The world is in their hands
When you teach the children, teach them thе very best you can, hey

[Chorus]
Thе world won't get no better
If we just let it be, woah
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me

[Verse 2]
Wake up all the doctors, make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer and who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long before their Judgment Day
So won't you make them happy before they pass away, ohh

Wake up, all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out, cause they do every time, hey

[Chorus]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, woah
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me

[Interlude]
Oh, yeah
I need a little help
(Spoken)
Put your hands together y'all
Come on
(Sung)
I need a little help y'all
I can't do it alone
Come on

[Outro]
Wake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed
Wake up everybody
Oh, I need a little help
Can't do it alone
I need a little help
Come on, come on
Hey, ohhh
Wake up everybody
Woah, I need a little help
I can't do it alone

Oh, quelle émotion
De me me lever chaque jour sachant que je suis aimée par toi
Je n'arrive pas à y croire
Qu’ai-je fait pour mériter quelqu'un pour me serrer de la façon dont tu le fais?

[Pré-Refrain 1]
Si personne n'est parfait
Alors tout ce que je veux c’est d'être imparfait avec toi

[Refrain]
Car tu me prends telle que je suis

341,21416,In the Morning,Deonna Martin,"[Sway]: The most important artist of this generation. Over 21 Grammy's. 6 Consecutive number 1 albums. One of the most impactful voices to ever grab a microphone. One of the most talented producers to ever produce music, fashion, art. One of the most prolific people to ever speak on behalf of his thoughts; to trigger emotions and trigger thoughts of you. One of the most clever people to ever manipulate the internet. I watched him go from:

[Kanye West]: Sway you gotta hear my rhymes man you gotta hear my rhymes I know I make beats but you gotta hear my rhymes

[Sway] Being on the train, Amtrak train going to Philly, to now being mentioned alongside the President of the United States, more than once. We talk about President Obama, but you forgot some of the things that this man as said to really go against the grain and challenge thought fearlessly. For example:

[Kanye West]: George Bush doesn't care about black people

[Kanye West]: And another thing is, people are so gay-conscious now. That's like the whole thing like with the Internet — every day, somebody's- ""Ooh I can tell he gay now!"" you know, but back in the day, people used to have songs like ""Get In That Ass"" or something like that

[Kanye West]: Remind me who's the original superfly, and I got love for Hov but I ain't fucking with that Suit and Tie

[Sway]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome for the first time to Sway in the Morning here at Shade 45: the one, the only, the incomparable, Kanye West![Sway]: What's is going to happen with the Red Octobers?

[Kanye West]: You know Nike told me when I asked them? ""We ain't sure."" You know what they told the store though, of my- of my boy that run the store? They said ""if you want that Red October, you gotta take these 10 other shoes."" So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told them, if you want that Red October- but legally, we gotta both sign that contract, Mark Parker. I'mma put Mark Parker all on that Summer Jam screen. And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in Donda. I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes. But if you guys that're investing in the arts, y'all don't want to invest in the school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to Africa, I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am Warhol. I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney. Nike. Google. Now who's gonna be the Medici family and stand up and let me create more; or do you wanna marginalize me 'til I'm out of my moment

[Sway]: But why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself?

[Kanye West]: How, Sway!?

[Sway]: Take a few steps back, and-

[Kanye West (and Sway)]: You ain't got the answers man! You ain't got the answers! (Kanye) You ain't got the answers, Sway! (Kanye) I been doing this more than you! (Doing what more than me?) You ain't got- (C'mon, chill out, bro!) You ain't got the answers! (Kanye, relax!) You ain't got the answers! (Bro, rela- I'm asking you a question!) You ain't been doing the education. (Bro!) You ain't been doing the education! (Kanye, calm down!) You don't have the answers though. (Calm down!) Because you trying to give me advice about something- (No! No no no no, listen) You ain't- You ain't got the answers! You ain't spend 13 million dollars of your own money trying to empower yourself!

[Sway]: I know, and you're absolutely right, but I've spent hundreds and thousands putting out clothing line at a smaller degree
[Kanye West]: And that and that ain't Ralph though! It ain't Ralph level

[Sway]: Okay well let me ask you this--

[Kanye West]: What's the name of your clothing line? We don't know

No man you don't have the answers

[Sway]: Why is it that you can't?

[Kanye West]: I just told you I lost the money


[Sway]:Okay so you dont have money

You dont have to turn up
This ain't no fucking show

Ain't no homie

Ain't no ain't no hold up
Ain't no holdI can make shit rhyme
I can make shit rhyme if I'm
Feel like, even if I, don't
So I just, might not, cause I
Don't want, and I'm just gon'
Freestyle, for the first time
With a, freestyle, that don't, even go together, oh
No rhymes, that's my new shit, nothing rhyme
How that sound, uh oh, woh
You ain't got the answers, Sway

She used to snatch me out of bed on Sunday morning
Head to Sunday School then straight to church
When the preacher starts, I start yawning
I was tired and read' to go
I couldn't wait to leave
The choir sang - they were off the chain
I started feeling differently (Ooh)

They were swinging from side to side (Ooh)
Some lady said ""Pass the mic"" (Ooh)
They were singing His praises I cried (Ooh)
Felt the spirit take over inside (Ooh)

So I found my way back to the church
And the choir spoke to me, yeah (Ooh)

It turned to be...L-O-V-E, and I was your man, so
You was my, lady-friend, we spent time
I found a way to be by your side
Through the ins and outs, the wrongs and rights
After a while of bein' settled down, I didn't know how
To keep the love, 'cause I was young

So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying

Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk

[Bridge]
There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us

[Chorus]
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 3]
Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he
Will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
""I'll be home so soon, I won't be late""

[Chorus]
He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day there'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same

Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

Free to fly your pretty wings around)

And I miss you more and more

I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

[Chorus]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?

Tell me why you had to come so late, I've been needing you
I finally can hear the words we spoke for so long
I wonder if it could be fate? Cause I want you
But life is messing with us, and we're faded
It's like the way you close your eyes, then you pull me closer again
Somehow this don't feel real, I need to pinch myself
Cause then I wait another year or two, 'till I see you again
I want you for my own, to me you're royalty

[Chorus]
Why is life so hard sometimes?
I feel like by whether I'm so torn or naked deep inside
Hey and did you mean what you said last night?
Or was it just one of those in the moment things you say when you've had too much to drink?

And departure's waiting right around the corner

359,21470,Keep Ya Head Up,Jhené Aiko,"[Verse]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
Aiko cares, but don't nobody else care
I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, yeah, but keep ya head up

[Outro]
Things are gonna get easier
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up (uh)
Things are gonna get easier
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

Ooh, child, things'll get brighter (aye)
Things are gonna get easier
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up
Keep ya head up
Things'll get brighter

Your man don't understand you
Something 'bout your body speaks a different language

Your eyes translate
And your heart starts racing
We're about to attempt what only lovers do

The night time is the right time to take a ride
To where the muses hide
Do you like the sight

Through the Juno bush you see her lips are miming Gwen Stefani
The horizon takes a trip along her body
Staring at the posters on your wall
As they talk about my chances

Your floor was damaged from months ago
Where you dropped a hot comb dancing to neo-soul
The trees are gold on your iPhone background

Like eight last spring for the view now

How's it feel?
Is it too much for you?

Last night in my dream, I was talking to you
You know who you are, were you dreaming too?
‘Cause in my life, things are built on
They're built on

[Chorus]
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate

[Verse 3]
Then on my way home, I met this guy
He was not so shy, you know, not that kind
We spoke, then suddenly, I could read his mind
You think it’s mad, but I don’t fool myself
You think it's odd, 'cause in my life
In my life, things are built on
They're built on
They're built on

[Chorus]
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate

I've had my eyes on you
For a while and though
It seems that time isn't right, I know
You want the love that I've got to give

We laughed and kissed
'Til the sun took us by surprise
Telling the whole truth about our lives
I'm so in love with what you've got to give

[Chorus]
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
Let me show you, baby
Don't be afraid of a good thing
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache

[Verse 2]
You think your heart needs to hurt for a while longer
Live all alone 'til it makes you stronger
Learn who you are without her love
I know, I've been there before
But I won't wait for a love like yours
I can't hesitate, stay a while
And let me change your mind

[Chorus]
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
Let me show you, baby
Don't be afraid of a good thing
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
(Won't you let me show you?)
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
Let me show you, baby
Don't be afraid of a good thing
(I just wanna love you, don't be afraid)
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache, yeah, woo-ooh
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache
Let me show you, baby
Don't be afraid of a good thing
I can show you that love
Is the cure for heartache

369,21468,I Believe In Love,Jessie J,"[Verse 1]
I found myself daydreaming of a better world
Memories can bleed in my open heart
London clouds are crying, but I'm dancing in the pouring rain
Grown-up life is to learn not to fall apart

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm closer to high vibrations
Learning of the sweeter and deeper waves
And what I can do to make it
To be at peace and be true to me in every way

[Chorus]
I know I'll be alright
I know that I'll survive
I know I'll rise above it
'Cause I believe in love
And even when it's hard
Livin' with my scars
It never mounts to nothing
'Cause I believe in love

[Verse 2]
Nobody tells me how to grow, no
I just gotta know
Emotional, but I won’t define myself on the past
Balance is key, understanding I can't be, won’t be always in control
Sometimes the right road is by taking the broken path

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm closer to high vibrations
Learning of the sweeter and deeper waves
And what I can do to make it
To be at peace, be true to me in every way

[Chorus]
I know I'll be alright
I know that I'll survive
I know I'll rise above it
'Cause I believe in love
And even when it's hard
Livin' with my scars
It never mounts to nothing
'Cause I believe in love

[Bridge]
Yes, woah
Keep it simple
Follow my heart
This love I’m into, yes
Can't rush the art of trust now
The more that time flies away
The closer it feels to wise with age
New energy is giving me life

[Outro]
'Cause I believe in love (I believe, I believe in love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I believe)
'Cause I believe in love (I believe, I believe in love, ooh, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I believe in love (I believe, oh)
Oh, 'cause I believe in love (I believe in love)
I believe in love
(And we're done)

370,21465,What You Don't Do,Lianne La Havas,"[Verse 1]
Heavy words, little lies
Telling everything but the truth, the truth
Three little words over time overheard and overused, used
No sweet nothing could ever be turned into something new
No grand gesture could ever be made to measure you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I got and I know where we're going
You don't need to show it, I already know it all

[Chorus]
It's what you don't do, it's what you don't say

It's what you don't do, the games you don't play
(It's what you don't do) I know you love me, I don't need proof

I've been saving up my time so I could spend it all on you, on you
Oh, all I need is to see you smile; I've forgotten how to be blue, blue

Don't tell the whole world; just wanna be your girl

The closer we get, oh
The less we need to show

It's what you don't do, it's what you don't say

It's what you don't do, the games you don't play

Yeah
I just wanna do you right
Yeah
I just wanna do you right
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
'Cause you deserve everything and more
You're royalty, a true queen that a king adore
I need you by my side, you the type I bring on tour
Let's fall asleep in L.A., wake up out in Singapore
Doing things I never did before
Fuck being selfish, I just wanna give you more
I'm going out my way so you know what I'm in it for
I pay attention, all the little things to listen for
True love's true compromise
Ride or die by my side as I'm on the rise
But if I fell off tomorrow, would you disappear?
Sorry, it sounds like I don't trust you, I apologize
But I'm a lover and I'm tryna give you all of me
So if you're down to follow me
Gotta do it honestly
You heard about them hoes, my reputation follows me
But I just cut 'em off, trading quantity for quality, you know?
Make it easy

[Pre-Chorus: Louis Mattrs & G-Eazy]
I believe, I believe, I believe (I believe)
I'ma be, I'ma be, I'ma be the one you need (the one you need, you know)
I believe, I believe, I believe (I believe in us, I believe in trust, yeah)
And I will show you that

[Chorus: Louis Mattrs & G-Eazy]
I won't settle for no less (no less)
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right
I hold heaven in both hands
Give you my hardest, no rest (you know)
I just wanna do you right, girl (yeah)
I just wanna do you right (uh)
I just wanna do you right (uh)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Given you my all, nothing less than
More than a wifey, than my best friend
Do it all for my baby, not a question
Your hatin' friends keep hatin', bless them
I wanna be in your room, we could sleep all day
I wanna be somewhere the bullshit can stay away
I wanna get to the point where I don't have to lie
When you ask me ""Is everything going to be okay?""
It's easier to sell a dream than keep it real
It's easier to numb the pain than really feel
Make it vanish in a moment with a magic pill
It's easier to lay away than pay the bill
Uh, would you stay with me if I was broke?
When we look in these mirrors, are we seein' smoke?
And this might be the realest shit I wrote
Love's a challenge but this ain't gotta be difficult

[Chorus: Louis Mattrs]
I won't settle for no less
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right
I hold heaven in both hands
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right

[Outro: Louis Mattrs]
And I will bring you all my rights
I just wanna do you right, yeah
I won't leave you down and out behind me
I just wanna do you right, I just wanna do you right
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right

Brothers, y'all alright?
Lemme see how y'all groove to this
Alright

I'm gettin' tired of your shit
You don't never buy me nothin'
See, every time you come around
You gotta bring Jim, James, Paul, and Tyrone
See, why can't we be by ourselves, sometimes?

Whip out the phone but I'm sure you'll ignore your response

Oh Lord, oh Lord
Ooh, oh, yeah, oh
Well

[Verse 1]
I remember when I used to love someone
That looked just like you
And also I can remember
The smell of her sweet perfume
She used to tell me things that I used to love
She had her way of getting the best of my heart
And also she had a way of keeping me smiling
But now she's gone

[Chorus]
I used to love someone
But now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me
Stripping the walls of my heart

[Verse 2]
Also I can remember the first day that you came in my life
(Came into my life, oh)
It seemed then that you were a little more open
With all of your thoughts
And the days you used to talk to me
But now I don't know (Know) who you really are (Are no more)
It seems that the look of your eyes
Is that you're drifting off from afar
And you don't even seem the same
It's like you're playing a game with me

I used to love someone
But now I'm on the run

But now I'm on the run

But now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me
(She had a hold on me)
Stripping my heart, oh-oh-oh-oh
And I don't know what made me do it
Something came along and blew it
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Someone caught it, someone caught it
I used to love someone
But now I'm on the run from the
From the love I once knew
Stripping the walls of my heart, used to love
That looked just you
Sometimes I could still, scent of you, smell her perfume
She had a hold on me
Stripping, stripping my heart

It's not that I don't wanna love you
Just can't get over her
Her love, it lingers in my mind

Knowin' me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sendin' over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay poppin' like a toaster
Nobody, come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
We'll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flyin' my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill

Oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
She is, 25
Spent over half of her life
So afraid to speak her mind
It's such a shame, 'cause oh, what a brilliant mind

[Chorus]
She has, and now that she's been introduced to confidence
She doesn't see, that she is bordering on arrogance
When will she learn, to come back to the middle?
Oh

He is, a young black man
Grew up without his father
And now it falls into his hands
To protect his mother
'Cause if he doesn't, well then who will?
His older brother, he lives in fear
Of everything, especially
Tryna fill his father's shoes

[Chorus]
Respectively, they go to extremes, of masculine and feminine
Chasing dreams, but they keep on falling, 'cause they don't know no balance
When will they learn, to come back to the middle?

[Bridge]
You gotta take the good with the bad, and you might hit the wall
Sometimes you'll fly and sometimes you will fall
There ain't no way to avoid the pain
But it's getting burned, that's how you will learn
To come back to the middle
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Come back to the middle, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Needing to protect yourself, now that is just a part of life
If you let your fears keep you from flying, you will never reach your height
To get to the top you must come back to the middle (Oh, oh, oh)
When will we learn, to come back to the middle?
When will we learn? Oh, oh, oh
Come back to the middle (Come back)
Come back to the middle (Come back)
Come back to the middle, yeah, yeah (Come back to the middle)
Don't make no mind about falling down
'Cause it's when you're in that valley
You can see both sides more clearly
Back to the middle (Come back)
Back to the middle (Come back)
Back to the middle (Come back to the middle)
Come back to the middle, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Come back to the middle) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Broken hearts everywhere
From stepping on love we don't care
Somebody tell me what we gonna do
Even though it's plenty to share
People hungry in the streets life just ain't fair
But you never think about it until it's you

[Pre-Hook]
Now I'm gonna say how I feel
And what I wanna say is  love is the only thing that's real
Now I'm gonna tell you what to do
Just believe that love is the only thing we have that's true

[Hook]
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
Love is the answer to the questions in your mind
If you looking it's the answer that you'll find
It's the only thing that everybody needs
It's the only thing that makes us truly free

[Verse 2]
Friends nowhere to be found
To help you when you are down
But you know that you're the one to blame
We know what's wrong from what's right
Nobody wins in a fight but still we play the game

Just look around the whole wide world
So many beautiful things to see
Take my hand and come along
Spread some love with me

But you never put me on the strip, put it on then you strip
Put it on your fingertips and I'll kiss it off
You better not kiss me goodbye, Test my faith and kiss the cross
I'm trying to go there, take you slow there if it's alright
Tell me that you care, baby, we could share a full life
Truth and double dare that I do repair broken hearts
Cupid shot me in the dark, stupid I didn't play my part
Ask for your forgiveness, if it's worth it I can serve a purpose
If I'm st.. st.. stuttering because I'm nervous
Tell me that you love me still, promise that I'm staying still
Honesty is all I need, honestly, we can build

I'd rather be at home with Ray

He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

[Verse 2]
The man said ""Why do you think you here?""
I said, ""I got no idea""
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near

This, me: ""Yeah, baby, and the rest""

Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ""No, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

I was reborn when I was broken
I wouldn't believe, I wouldn't believe, no
Been through a storm, no use in hopin'
That you would come rescue me
Somehow your love set me free

And I
I can let my life pass me by

Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time

Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime, lifetime

There was a time when love wasn't chosen
Now I'm just hopin' for more
Now I'm just reachin' out for somethin' better than I had before, girl

Ooh, and I
I can let my life pass me by

Work it all out this lifetime

Oh, if I take it one day at a time
Oh, spread my love out and fly
Oh, I (I can move to the light)

Maybe you will see, maybe you will see
Ooh, woah, woah, woah, oh
Lifetime, lifetime

Ooh, and I
I can let my life pass me by
I can just try and try
Work it all out this lifetime, lifetime

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Well baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Chorus]
Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

[Chorus]
Maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah ... hallelujah

In the shade, gradually there were things revealed to me

But it was there before I came
Makin' crazy accusations, tracing all of my footsteps
For overreactin', got me packin'

Look at me, look at me, I can't allow you to live rent free
In my heart or in my head, can't let you back in my bed

Ladies and gentlemen
(Gen—, gentlemen, gentlemen)
We got Anthony Hamilton in the house tonight
He just came from off tour
He got a little something he wanna say

[Verse 1: Anthony Hamilton]
I know you love me
I can tell by the that you kiss me, tight when you hug me
Took me to school the very first day
You gave me a piece of butterscotch, sent me on my way
I know it's frightening now
I can tell by the pain in your eyes when the rent was late again
Too strong to fold, being on your own
Lord, bless her soul
Mama knows love

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Mama knew love like the back roads
Used to fall asleep daily in her work clothes (Hey, hey)
Mom, I swear, you'll never have to worry again
(Mama, I swear, you'll never have to worry, no, no)
Mama knew love like the back streets (Mama knew love)
Used to wipe pee just to make the end meet
Mom, I swear, you'll never have to worry again

[Verse 2: Anthony Hamilton]
Up bright and early, scrambled eggs
Swellin' in your legs, bills on the bed
Still you managed to show me a smile
Then walk to work about two or three miles
Mom, I'm gonna struggle wit'cha
I'm gonna help you see the bigger picture
You gave me something no one could take away
You made it so easy to say ""I love you, mama""

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Mama knew love like the back roads
(See, mama knew love)
Used to fall asleep daily in her work clothes (Every day)
Mom, I swear, you'll never have to worry again
(You'll never have to worry again, mom, I love you, yeah, yeah)
Mama knew love like the back streets (Mama knew love)
Used to wipe pee just to make the end meet (Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
Mom, I swear, you'll never have to worry again (No, no, no)

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
Mama knew love (See, mama knew love)
She gave me love (Crazy love)
Crazy love (Crazy love)
So much love (Mama knew love)
Mama knew love (Crazy love)
She gave me love (She gave me)
Crazy love (She gave me, gave me everything)
So much love (Mama)

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Mama knew love like the back roads
Used to fall asleep daily in her work clothes
Mom, I swear, you'll never have to worry again
(I swear, mama don't have to worry)
Mama knew love like the back streets
Used to wipe pee just to make the end meet
Mom, I swear, you'll never have to worry again (Never, never)
Mama knew love like the back roads
Used to fall asleep daily in her work clothes (Mama knew love)
Mom, I swear, you'll never have to worry again
(She gave me love)
Mama knew love like the back streets
Used to wipe pee just to make the end meet (Gave me lovin')
Mom, I swear, you'll never have to worry again

Crazy love, crazy love, crazy love

414,21500,Love,Musiq Soulchild,"[Verse 1]
Love
So many things I've got to tell you
But I'm afraid I don't know how
'Cause there's a possibility
That you'll look at me differently
Love
Ever since the first moment I spoke your name
From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change 'cause

[Chorus]
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

[Verse 2]
Many days I've longed for you
Wanting you
Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss
For your touch, your feel, your Presence
Many nights I've cried from the things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you
I know that you're real
With no doubts and no fears
And no questions

[Chorus]
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

[Bridge]
At first you didn't mean that much to me, no
But now I know you're all I need
The world looks so brand new to me
Now that I found love
Everyday I live for you, yeah
And everything that I do, I do it for you
What I say is how I feel so believe it's true
You got to know I'm true

[Chorus]
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first
Love

More than the shoes on my feet (more)
Oh, you are- more than to me

The moment that I saw you

You're my autumn when the seasons change
Falling in love, can't wait to change to rain

You make my heart beat-
Change me from Miss to Mrs
Granted all my wishes, you're More.....

Or pray for
You are my joy, oh

416,21515,Dear Life,Anthony Hamilton,"Oh my baby
Oh my love
Ooh oh oh

Early was the morn
Flowers filled with dew
I became somebody through loving you
Softly as a child born in natural rain
I predict the seasons to go unchanged

Sometimes in life
You run across a love unknown
Without a reason
It seems like you belong
Hold on, dear life
Don't go off running from what's new
I became somebody through loving you

Warm was the sun that covered my body so
Reminded me of you as I'd first known
Those were the days
The days that changed my life and made me new
I became somebody through loving you

Sometimes in life
You run across a love unknown
Without a reason
It feels like you belong
Hold on, dear life
Don't go off running from what's new
I became somebody through loving you

As the sun shined down on me
I know with you in love is where I wanna be
Oh sometimes, I go on through life
Thinking that love is something that's not meant for me

Woah, somebody, somebody

Hold on, dear life
Don't go off running from what's new
I became somebody through loving you
I became somebody through loving you
Oh, I became somebody through loving you
Woah oh ooh

417,21516,These Eyes,India.Arie,"These eyes never saw you leavin
This heart is in need of some healing
These arms are letting you go
Our life is the greatest story never told

How many more ways can I explain this to you boy
We have had this conversation several times before
I will except nothing less than your complete respect
If you cannot give me that then maybe I should step

These eyes never saw you leavin
This heart is in need of some healing
These arms are letting you go
Our life is the greatest story never told

All this cryin all this fightin simply ain't my style
Though you're one of the most important people in my life
I loved you from the day we met, I know you loved me too
But at this point walking away is the best thing we can do

These eyes never saw you leavin
This heart is in need of some healing
These arms are letting you go
Our life is the greatest story never told

Were we meant to be man and wife?
The answer I don't know
Of life's many mystery's what intrigues me the most
Is who our children would have been
I guess we'll never know
Even as I walk away I'll always keep the hope

These eyes never saw you leavin
This heart is in need of some healing
These arms are letting you go
That's life

That's the way the story goes
Truth is every relationship is a lesson
Truth is I saw it coming but it hurts anyway
Truth is I'm not the reason you're so angry
Truth is you're not the reason I'm so passive
Truth is I've got to take back my power
Truth is

The reason why it hurts so bad
To walk away from you

These eyes I never saw you leavin
This heart my heart is in need of some healing
These arms, These arms are letting you go
The greatest story never told (2x)

Our love is the greatest story never told
Our life is the greatest story never told (2x)

And that's the way the story goes...

Hot as the 4th of July
The wind came in
And graced my face
And it led me to your eyes

Something told me
I'd be seeing you again
But for some reason I still cried
Now years have gone by
I'm still by your side
But there's something on my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, seems like it don't matter
If I'm speaking my truth
Or hiding some to protect the lie
And at the end of the day
You still have something to say
Can't get the blues off your mind

I don't know how
I don't know how to love you

Oh I, I don't know baby
I don't know how
Said I don't know how to love you

In the morning
I reach for your embrace
'Cause I know that you need mine
And I want you to know
It can stay this way
Till the end of our lives

When my words get all tangled up all on the floor
Oh yeah, but I beg of you that you trust in me
That I will always be here to give you more and more and more and more
More more more

And so is love
God is inside you, all around you and up above
Growing
Showing

Just in-between

Teach him not to lie
Make him laugh until he cries

I'd quickly give my freedom
To be held in your captivity
I am ready for love
All of the joy and the pain
And all the time that it takes
Just to stay in your good grace

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been thinking
Maybe you're not ready for me
Maybe you think I need to learn maturity
They say watch what you ask for
'Cause you might receive
But if you ask me tomorrow
I'll say the same thing

[Verse 3]
I am ready for love
Would you please lend me your ear?
I promise I won't complain
I just need you to acknowledge I am here

[Verse 4]
If you give me half a chance
I'll prove this to you
I will be patient, kind, faithful and true
To a man who loves music
A man who loves art
Respects the spirit world
And thinks with his heart, oh

[Verse 5]
I am ready for love
If you'll take me in your hands
I will learn what you teach
And do the best that I can

[Verse 6]
I am ready for love
Here with an offering of
My voice, my eyes
My soul, my mind
Tell me what is enough
To prove I am ready for love
I am ready

430,21514,Like A Feather,Nikka Costa,"[Verse 1]
Coming out of my wishin well
Where only echoes lonely hear my prayers
I'm coming around to bending
Cause my resistance's been far too persistent
I've come too far to force it
So I'll watch it slide and land
I could come on strong and willful but
I'd rather watch it fall to the palm of my hand

[Chorus]
And when I
Set it free
Like a feather
It will be
And when I rise
To see it done
Like whatever
It will be
It will be

[Verse 2]
I'm taking a breather baby
From sitting on pins waiting for my sky to fall
I'm taking up giving in
So here's the wheel, I'm putting my feet up
Take another look at me baby
Today I'm taking on catastrophe
I'd rather take it easy
Than try to force what's on its way to me

[Chorus]
And when I
Set it free
Like a feather
It will be
And when I rise
To see it done
Like whatever
It will be
It will be

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Outro]
We're only afraid if we pull back the blinds too far
The light behind that we free will blind other stars
But the truth doesn't blind it helps to see far
So get ready to be
We're only afraid if we pull back the blinds too far
The light behind that we free will blind other stars
But the truth doesn't blind it helps to see far
It's who you are

You're part of me and I'm part of you
You're living proof of my dream come true
Here in my walls I will protect you
I'll tell you straight up, re-educate you in love

You can pout, you can smile
You don't have to be perfect
Cause you're perfect the way that you are

Is it my imagination?
I think I'm losing my mind
Still see your face all the time

Tryna rewind 'til we're back where we started

Waiting on a deja-vu
But until then

I live with hallucinations
They're just hallucinations

Losing my concentration
Hearing your voice in my head
Seeing you when you aren't there
You're not there
And I can't keep living like this
Something's gotta give (give me you)
If I could make it all go away
Then I would

Like a montage in a movie, right before the hero dies
Like the first time that you listen to your favorite singer live
Like an echo in a canyon
Like tears, but you're not sad
Like a sunrise on a mountain
I wanna move you like that

[Refrain]
(Ooh, ooh)
Oh, I wanna move you like that (ooh, ooh)

When a lyric really gets ya and it breaks you down inside

Like faded photographs
Like the thrill of Christmas morning
Yeah, I wanna move you like that

Oh, I wanna move you like that (ooh, ooh)

Like a solemn Hallelujah
Like a choir shouts ""Amen"" (Amen)

And he fights for freedom's callin'
I wanna move you like that

When words can't make it right
Like the first time that I met you
I fell so hard, so fast
Like that montage in a movie
Mmm, the way you move me
I wanna move you like that

[Verse 1: Niia]
Yeah, I know, she's still the background on your phone, and
I know, I know, it takes time to get someone out your mind
But you don't give me any signs
And I told you all the passwords to mine
And I'll admit I haven't been completely faithful
It was way back, in April, and we didn't have a label
Yeah, I tried to play it cool, 'cause we're never really stable
It's never ever able to figure out

[Chorus: Niia]
Keep waiting for the right time
While you keep me on the side line
I'm sick of all this trying, trying, trying
While I watch you drift further away, yeah

[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan]
It's like I have you but I don't really have you
But I'm giving you all of me, when I only get half of you
Sometimes I'm way too understanding and I give too many chances
I keep making up excuses while you make-off like a bandit
But now, it's getting harder to ignore
Settled for so little, but I want so much more from you, my dear
You've got to make things clear

[Chorus: Niia & Jazmine Sullivan]
Keep waiting for the right time
While you keep me on the side line
I'm sick of all this trying, trying, trying
While I watch you drift further away, yeah

[Bridge: Niia & Jazmine Sullivan]
I know I'm better than you make me feel
Told me you'd love me so I'd know it's real
You know I try, try to believe in us
Try to believe in us, but it gets hard as fuck, you know it
Keep waiting for the right time
Still on that side line
I'm so far away

[Chorus: Niia & Jazmine Sullivan]
Waiting for the right time
While you keep me on the side line
I'm sick of all this trying, trying, trying
While I watch you drift further away
Waiting for the right time
While you keep me on the side line
I'm sick of all this trying, trying, trying
While I watch you drift further away, yeah

435,21531,This Ain't the Way,Jeremy Passion,"[Verse 1: Jeremy Passion]
Stepped off the peak of a good time
Right back to the valley of a bad rhyme
All these ups and downs, can we turn around
And stay high
High above the sky and fly? But gravity...
Sometimes it feels good
Sometimes it don't
Then at times, it's visible
Sometimes less shown
Gotta work this out no other way around
We're both grown
You and I, baby you and I

[Chorus: Jeremy Passion]
Darlin' take my hand
Realize we're on the same team
Try to understand that I'm not your enemy
Let's work it out, give and take or agree to disagree 'cause
This ain't the way love supposed to be

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly]
Just the other day, we were doin' fine
Even on a rainy day we had sunshine
But just like a hat, you snapped back
You changed your mind
Ooo boy, tell me why we gotta do this all the time?
You say I got a lot of fire? Well you're cold as ice
If people only knew that you are not always nice
Bite your tongue, and watch your tone
Think before you speak 'cause
You gotta know what this woman needs

[Chorus: Jeremy Passion & Tori Kelly]
Darlin' take my hand
Realize we're on the same team
Try to understand that I'm not your enemy
Let's work it out, give and take or agree to disagree 'cause
This ain't the way love supposed to be

It ain't hard to see we need a change
'Cause we know our love is not the same
Baby, this ain't a riddle
Gotta meet in the middle
This time

Let's work it out
Give and take or
Agree to disagree 'cause
This ain't the way babe
This ain't the way love supposed to be

We gotta work this out, oh
Communicate with me girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I love you, can't you see it girl?
This ain't the way, babe

436,21526,Foreign Fields,Kacy Hill,"[Verse 1]
When will we fall?
Silence over us all
Seek peace in chains
Rapt in exchange
Somewhere farther we both know
Take me higher than you’ll go
Stuck in feeling something real
Skeptic to a new ideal

[Chorus]
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Foreign fields

[Verse 2]
Lost in our mood
Afraid to feel truth
Succumb to your youth
Melt into seclude
Velvet touch to swollen brace
Languorous movements we both make
Lithe perception, who’s to blame?
Osculate until we break

Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields

When I get to Warwick Avenue
Meet me by the entrance of the tube
We can talk things over a little time
Promise me you won't step out of line
When I get to Warwick Avenue
Please, drop the past and be true
Don't think we're okay just because I'm here
You hurt me bad, but I won't shed a tear

[Chorus]
I'm leaving you for the last time, baby
You think you're loving, but you don't love me
I've been confused, out of my mind lately
You think you're loving, but I want to be free
Baby, you've hurt me

When I get to Warwick Avenue
We'll spend an hour, but no more than two
Our only chance to speak once more
I showed you the answers, now here's the door
When I get to Warwick Avenue
I'll tell you, baby, that we're through

I'm leaving you for the last time, baby

You think you're loving but you don't love me
I want to be free, baby, you've hurt me

All the days spent together
I wished for better
But I didn't want the train to come
Now it's departed
I'm broken-hearted
Seems like we never started
All those days spent together
When I wished for better
And I didn't want the train to come!
Oh, oh

Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
'Cause you got me face down

And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts, I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you

[Verse 2]
Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up?
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
'Til I made you so
You better act like you know

Everybody's like ""He's no item""
""Please don't like him""
""He don't wife 'em""
""He one nights 'em""
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
Then tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
(God damn) God damn, baby, my mind's blown
Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And, yeah, I know what you did
But, baby, I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind of shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

[Bridge]
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

And though I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
I still want you (Oh)

Let me make one thing clear, you can buy me a beer
But you ain't taking me home
No pickup lines, I came here tonight
To shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room, I couldn't help but notice you
Seem a little down on your luck too
Yeah, my heart might be breakin', but this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

[Chorus]
We should be drinkin' alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinkin' alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up, tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only, but just 'cause we're lonely
Don't mean that we should

We should be drinkin' alone

With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em

Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone

Maybe we shouldn't be drinkin' alone (We should be drinkin' alone)

Making moves and losing out
Played so many times before
And there ain't nothing to brag about
But this must be a new brew
When you're gone I'm singing Blue Moon
You turn me all the way around
And I'm tired of the fine line

I just want you to be forever mine
Be forever mine

Oh and there's nothing I can sing now
That ain't been sung before
Oh but your love is a standout
So go on ahead and take the floor

Now I'm stuck in your voodoo
Pick me up, don't ever put me down
Look I'm tired of the fine line

I just want you to be forever mine
I want you to be forever mine

The way that you move, never seen it before
Looking for my head, can’t find it no more
You ransom my heart and I get the reward

You got me shook like the Mobb when they rhyme
Come out of nowhere come blessing my life
I just want you to be forever mine, oh oh

Be forever mine
Be forever mine

For the good thing he'd found
If she's bad I mean real bad he can't see it
She can never never do him no wrong
He'd turn his back on his best friend
Oh if he put har down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin to hold on on he want to hold on
To what he think he need
But he don't need it
He'll give up all his comfort
Leave his happy home
And go sleep out in the rain
If that's the way if she tell him
Honey oh that's the way I want you to be

Cause this man sure loves you woman
Give you everything I had
Tryin to hold on hold on
To your high class love
Baby baby please please don't treat me bad

Ooh When a man loves a woman
But situation to be
Down deep in his soul
She could bring him
Oh he could feel such misery
If she plays him for a fool
Everybody in the community
Could know about it
He'll be the last one to know

Can never see

One thing I want to say before
I leave you this evenin
You see I feel like it's good
To have a love that won't let you down
I feel like it's good
To have a love will stick by you
Closer than a brother
You see I had a love once
And I felt so good about it

I went and told ma mother
I told my father I told my sister
And I told my brother
Said you just don't know

468,21552,Change My Mind,Lucie Silvas,"[Verse 1]
I never really wanted to grow up
'Cause what if magic only happens when you're young?
And I don't believe that the stars can align
'Til somebody comes to change my mind

[Verse 2]
I've never been one to settle down
And you won't catch my gypsy heart sticking around
'Cause I gotta keep moving to feel alive
'Til somebody comes to change my mind

[Chorus]
'Til somebody says, ""I love you""
And the earth cracks where you're standing
And you find all the answers
To the questions you've been asking
I don't know if that exists for me
But I'll keep looking 'til I find
Somebody to come and change my mind

[Verse 3]
You're never gonna see my vulnerability
'Cause letting your guard down only makes you weak
And love takes second place next to my pride
'Til somebody comes to change my mind

[Chorus]
'Til somebody says, ""I love you""
And the earth cracks where you're standing
And you find all the answers
To the questions you've been asking
I don't know if that exists for me
But I'll keep looking 'til I find
Somebody to come and change my mind
Oh

[Chorus]
'Til somebody says, ""I love you""
And the earth cracks where you're standing
And you find all the answers
To the questions you've been asking
I don't know if that exists for me
But I'll keep looking 'til I find
Somebody to come and change my mind

Somebody come and change my mind
Mmm, no
Change my mind
Oh, change my mind
Oh, no, no

470,21566,Lightly,Amos Lee,"Met her on a Tuesday
Went out on a Friday night
Said she was lookin' for a love affair
And I was lookin' for a getaway flight
So we packed up a bag
And hailed up a cab
And I grabbed my guitar because
It was the only thing that I had
Well I learned to travel lightly

Babe, livin' alone
Some say that it's the hard way, mama
But it's all that I've known
And if I move fast enough, hopefully
Oh the darkness can't catch up to me
Hey, Hey, Hey

So we headed off the mainland
With the beating of a drum
She turned and smiled and said, honey
Where you from?
I said I'm from all over
But I was born in the wind
She turned and smiled and said
You're goin' home again
Well I learned to travel lightly
Livin' alone

Some say that it's the hard way, mama
But it's all that I've known
And if I move fast enough, hopefully
Oh the darkness can't catch up to me
Hey, Hey, Hey
Oh I hear that train
A comin' around the bend
Oh in the morning I'll be
Runnin' away again
Runnin' away, runnin' away again
When she woke up in the morning

With the rising sun
In her heart she knew
I'd be gone
But I wrote her a letter
With the words to this song
She read it on the balcony
While the wind was strong
Well I learned to travel lightly

Cause I was born alone
Some say that it's the hard way, mama
But it's all that I've known
And if I move fast enough, hopefully
Oh the darkness won't catch up to me
Hey, Hey, Hey

471,21555,Devil in Me,Anderson East,"[Verse 1]
There's a girl in Shelbyville
Gave her life to Jesus
First Antioch Baptist Church, where her dad preaches
She's pretty as her mama; she's only 23
And she could be an angel, Lord
Cause she's bringing out the devil in me

[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me for what I'm thinking
Cause it's Saturday night and I'm high and I've been drinking
But come tomorrow morning across the aisle
I look over and see her smile
Bow my head and the choir sings
Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in me

[Verse 2]
Sundress on a willow tree
Smooth on the water
I know the Lord's been good to me when I look at the preacher's daughter
But she's my Delilah; she brings me to my knees
And she could be an angel
Cause she's bringing out the devil in me

[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me for what I'm thinking
Saturday night and I'm high and I've been drinking
But come tomorrow morning across the aisle
I look over and see her smile
Bow my head and the choir sings
Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in me

I was born by the river
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river, I've been runnin'
Ever since

It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

It's been too hard livin'
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there
Beyond the sky

It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

[Verse 3]
I go to the movie
And I go downtown
Somebody keep tellin' me ""don't hang around""

[Chorus]
It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

[Verse 4]
Then I go to my brother
And I say, ""Brother, help me please""
But he winds up
Knockin' me
Back down on my knees
Lor', there been times that I thought
I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to
Carry on

[Chorus]
It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

489,21562,When a Man Loves a Woman,Percy Sledge,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman...

Nothing without a woman or a girl

To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl

And a baby boys
Man make them happy
'Cause man make them toys
And after man make everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other man

Will you still kiss me?
And when we're home
Will you pretend I'm the only one you're dreaming of

I heard from your friends you had been untrue
Oh! But I did not believe them till I walked in on you
I wish you only - wanted me

And here I am like a fool tryin' to get it back

[Verse 1]
I joined up with the lonely hearts
I sent them a check by mail
But they had me correspondin' for eighteen months
With some girl doin' life in jail

[Chorus]
So send me back my money (Send him back his money)
Send me back my money (Send him back his money)
Oh, and don't be funny (Funny, honey)
Just send me back my money

When livin' in Tennessee
But when I got there to build my house
There were nothing but swamp and trees

Send me back my money (Send him back his money)
And don't try to be funny (Funny, honey)
Oh, lay that bridge back on

Woe is me, I'm about as mixed-up as a man can be
Even that old ice cream man tried to short-change me

[Verse 3]
I bought a case of miracle pills
And they were supposed to cure all of my ills
So I took some and fell out the bed
Started rollin' on the floor
With my hair fallin' out of my head

To help improve my speech
But you should've heard me tryin' to talk
At the end of the six weeks

She wouldn't be caught dead
Don't make sense to the neighbors, don't look good on paper
And sure don't make sense in my head

But I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we'll roll

Can't say there won't be rough patches
Scratches from thorns and briars
Over or under, we'll roll like thunder
As long as there's tread on these tires

I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll

Bring on the dark
Honey, don't worry

Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll

I grew up with the robbers and the felons
And they just got my dawg for eleven ki's
Remember I was sittin' on the boulevard
Now I'm flyin' tall over the seven seas
And I hate my little brother had to call me, collect
I just wanna fast forward to us all on the jet
Got some time 'cause he tried to play his cards in the deck
I done got so high I might fall off the jet, woah
My AP got a skeleton, woah
And I still pull up in my section, woah
The way he tote the chopper, gotta quit the talk
Some my niggas died at the corner store
The opps'll let the choppa spay for no reason
My best friend died ain't I know the meaning
That's why I been ballin' for four seasons
Nigga how you got the sauce and ain't got no seasoning?

I know my grandmomma pray for me
I know my grandmomma pray for me
And I know my momma still pray for me

I know my momma she gon' pray for me
I know my momma she gon' pray for me

I ain't goin' back to church
Ever since I seen my dawg inside the casket I been, hurt
I thank God it ain't worse
'Cause we was slidin' not no niggas had to pay for it
I want a billion, I told my momma to pray for it
'Cause we was trappin' and baggin' down to make more
And I'ma shoot out to Venus, I know it's miles away
I barely made out the struggle, I came from 'round the way
I, I, pull up in the parkin' lot with the Cullinan
I just pray to God I don't never fall off

I know my grandmomma pray for me
I know my grandmomma pray for me
And I know my momma still pray for me

Love has a way
(Of blaming the darkness)
Soft as the rain
(To feel like a blossom)
No matter which way things goes
(Tonight we're the strongest)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We'll hold each other's hands
Dancing slowly to the band
Letting the music take over

[Chorus]
I guess that's why everything looks so beautiful
When you're in love
Over time, we'll turn the desert to shades of gold
When it's sweet enough
Light as a feather, shining like a treasure
Everything is better, it's true
I guess that's why everything looks so beautiful
So beautiful when you're in love
When you're in love

[Verse 2]
I kiss is a drink
(And you found a fountain)
So why don't we see
(The magic that's happened?)
If you never let me go, boy
(If you never let me go)
You'd be the new fashion

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a brightness in your eyes
I've never seen until tonight
Everything's hazy but you

I guess that's why everything looks so beautiful
When you're in love

There's a conclusion to my illusion
I assure you this
There's no end to this confusion if you let it wish you well
Soul to sell, highest bidders can't you tell what you're getting?
There is a light to all this darkness, I will tell you this
There's redemption in you asking them just why it is
Some answers are better left unspoken when you know you ain't getting any

You ain't getting any

Why we fight to get on loving I've been wondering
How your mind will leave you hanging your heart lingering
Stay lost, then found, by whoever stays around forgetting
There is a way to be yourself, I assure you this
There's a way to catch your dreams without falling asleep
You might as well get it while you can, babe
Cause you know you ain't getting any

Open up, drink it in, don't ask too many questions
Become the vessel for the shame they feed you through suggestion
There's a rumor on the breeze, secrets that bring you to your knees
We made the problem, we are the poison, whoa
Close your eyes, surrender your beliefs to them for holding
Wait patiently to hear what ever-changing lines are showing
There's a whisper in the wind, eventual storm that's rolling in
They have the answers, cure for the cancer we've become
That we've become

[Chorus]
All they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us
We'll bring on the violence, the violence

Back and forth, daily take apart what you've been building (Building)
Everything you have is to be fed into the system
There's a force out pushing fear, a deafening silence drawing near
Sit, absorb it, guess we've been toxic all along, all along

All they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us
We'll bring on the violence, the violence (The violence)

Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue

546,21688,Alone,Marnik,"City lights in motion and sunsets by the ocean in my car
Staring at the stars
Walking down dilapidated memories, I never make it far
Because I wonder where you are

And is it so much to ask to be a firefly to petrify
The night with an ember to glow?
And is it so much to ask to see your face again? Where we began to grow
I guess I’ll never know

Like the wolves, I will look to the moon with a howl in the park
Alone in the Dark
Like your tears in the rain, I am lost and I won’t leave a mark
Alone in the Dark

No more chips left to cash, no more deep indebted stash to pawn
Accounts overdrawn
Silhouettes in stereo with old cassettes, the radio is on
But when I listen, you are gone

And is it a lot to want another lullaby for you and I
I try, but it’s so hard to hear
And is it a lot to want to travel back in time for one night
A dream where you don’t disappear

Like the wolves, I will look to the moon with a howl in the park
Alone in the Dark
Like your tears in the rain, I am lost and I won’t leave a mark
Alone in the Dark
Like the wolves, I will look to the moon with a howl in the park
Alone in the Dark
Like your tears in the rain, I am lost and I won’t leave a mark

Staring at the stars
Windy on the coast where I have known to hear your ghost in my guitar
Don’t let me fall apart

Like the wolves, I will look to the moon with a howl in the park
Alone in the Dark
Like your tears in the rain, I am lost and I won’t leave a mark
Alone in the Dark
Like the wolves, I will look to the moon with a howl in the park

I'll help you up when you feel alone

But after all you told me I’d be okay
Cause friends are worth a whole lot more than money
I hope that everyone who's felt like me
Can hold on and believe

The scent of summer in my bed
When we were footprints in the sand
Stealing liquor, making plans

With the sun in our eyes

Takin' over like you should
I'll take the pleasure with the pain

I'm selﬁsh, impatient, I can't pretend to
But babe you can, you can handle
Me at my worst, sure as hell, you deserve more

A friend is someone who knows all about you
It's really hard to ﬁnd someone trustful
But babe you can, you can handle
Me at my worst, sure as hell, you deserve more

Listen but don't trust
I'm left before you leave

I sing to you like no one ever listens

I dance with you like no one ever watches
I can't fall asleep cause reality is better than my dreams

People take pictures to save a moment
But we don't need photos we do it all over
But babe you can, you can handle

But I'm just scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost, sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost, I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better

Got phantom feelings I can never stop
Stranger things to worry 'bout, I know
But I'm just scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone

I can't see myself in the mirror
Does that mean I'm not really here?
Losin' touch with everything I know

If I could, I would have made things right

Yo I'm the dream
Something like Houston with Akeem
My team, win or lose, crews with the cream
Now playa-haters wanna take it to the extreme
Y'all cats could eat a dick like Idi Amin
See me I mean, I spit a whole round at ya derby
Call me Shame, cause I'm Low, Down and I'm Dirty
For the name
Cause can't no man stop the props or call me herby
Cause when my hand cocks the Glock I get dirty
GD, bond is where my word be
See me, then they name James then you ain't Worthy
To beat me
We be, dwellin in the ghetto
Don't fuck with rock-n-roll still we hold heavy metal
And bring it to you on every level
My crew very thorough
Pass the heavy shovel, I'mma bury every devil
I done fucked in every telly, and every borough
And give me head and give me bread Shally to Sheryll
Word bond, I'm gettin dirty on
Any song you heard me on
With AG and the dirty don
Huh?

Chorus: AG & D-Flow

What y'all niggas know about gettin dirty?
It's ShowB.I., AG-I
Party and Flow
Bacardi and Mo
We gettin dirty - repeat 5x

[Verse 2: A.G.]
It ain't a mystery why they likin us
We make the tightest stuff
You ain't as nice as us
Cause you don't write enough
Light it up, and represent for my block
While I rock like Charles Duntan
Spit and hit the dutchman
Hypnotize ya chick with the 6-nothin-nothin
Got my Spanish mommy rollin somethin
Definitely holdin somethin
Should have been on the flow goin down 5th Ave
With a big ass, but no
Gotta caught whiplash
Back to this poem
Tone, told me to drop on ya bitch-ass
Don't get it fucked up
I whip ass
The aim is to get cash
To blame is the Giant and the sick ass
We be bugged
Mix the hydro with the cocoa-bud
GD-slug to the head
Cause y'all niggas don't show no love
Hoes bug on my crib
Half my team did bits
All but me got kids but treat theirs like my own
Imagine when I'm blown
Feed 'em at my home
Go big feast
Like I'm runnin shit in the Mid-East
Huh?

We get dirty
We gettin dirty - 4x

[Verse 3: D-Flow]
While y'all cats pretendin y'are smart
We're flossin in a clark?
Toss ten in ya heart
In the game swimmin with sharks
We get dirty dog
Y'all niggas couldn't swim in the swambs
Now tell me how you a thug and never been in the Bronx?
The style you frontin, well it's quite old
And your so-called platinum watch is white gold
Niggas be tryin to snipe Flow
Cause I be in the flyest affairs
With trash y'all be dyin to wear
Me and my chick blowin lye in the air
You wack, vicious
While us rap niggas attract bitches
Stack figures and let the feds snap pictures
We black niggas, creepin all on your set
Ball till I'm wet
Watch how many cats, falls on my tec
Lyrical threat, cause you sound on the chest step?
And give me a reason you's my eye in a vest?
If I ever go broke it's because I ain't invest
Puff a pound of indo, be in the limo that's stretched
Ya rap sheet expired
Think ya sweet cause I'm quiet
That real shit I supply it
Fake nigga, you get ya face wired
74 niggas straight riot
Dirt done
And if you heard I ain't spit, nigga you heard wrong

I used to get so scared of falling hard
'Cause what if I couldn't get back up?
Tell myself I'm better off alone
'Cause knowing me, I'd always run

But let's go fire
Give in to desire
I'm not gonna fight it
No,I won't deny that

Ready for love
It's nothing to rush
I'm giving up, I'm giving up
'Cause you're the one

I got no limits in your arms
These boundaries with you are no fun
All my habits fall apart
I let go with every touch

When digging through a mound of what we built
What we built on

No one will compress what’s ours
No one will compress what's ours

Why don't you bore me with statue wit

Got the heart of Bear Grylls, mind of a boss
Need a brand new Supremes diva like Diana Ross
Blew my first check on Stone Island and Mosch
Before we signed a deal, we made the sign of the cross
Yeah, yeah, Disturbing London sign, we're the best
Word to the hardware that brought me my success
Pressure on my city put you under duress
Man's just tryna do his ting, now he's under arrest
What the fuck?
I know the time we living in is crazy and hot
More crazy than the eighties
Spilling more J.D., more Baileys
We need more Adenugas and more Daleys
Every time we flourish, they don't wanna see us sprout
Crabs in a barrel, they don't wanna see us out
Sticking to my roots, time to take a different route
London's where you'll find me, you know what I'm about, yeah, yeah

Make you feel to see your spirit every time we take a breath

So all the darkest nights are the days we won't regret

Lobster for my bae, beef with my ex
Lord, forgive my need to succeed and progress
They were all my favourite rappers, now they see me as a threat
What the heck?
I know the time we living in is crazy, huh?
I know that we're in modern day slavery
They tell me more commercial and more mainstream
Tried to get me writers, had to get up out that fake scene
Sick of the chicanery, skullduggery
That's why I had to holla Jake, it was buggin' me
The same mindset since I made Disc-Overy
Now people all around the world wanna come and see, yeah

Do I have to wait for a new mistake?
I need a brand-new day
I'm living for myself
No time to waste
Guess it's over now
And I'm breaking these chains

Brand-new day, it's a brand-new day
I can't believe you still act this way
Brand-new day, it's a brand-new day
Think I'd rather go than stay

I'm sick and tired of waiting
Don't feel like standing
Hеre with you, with you
I'm sick and tired of waiting
Don't feel like standing
Hеre with you, with you

You're there and back with this and that, but never knowing

The present's over and gone
So know I'm ready, I trust my soul
I'm hoping to fly with style, we shall know

Trust in me and set me free

I don't wish to try this alone
I feel lone, why shouldn't I go?
Cause even the time we're so longing gets blown

I haven't felt the rain falling for years
Lost more friends, and a lot more tears
More fears about travelling
Thinking 'bout my family
The more that I don't see 'em
I wish that I could see 'em
In a cage
For going on a thousand days
Feel like I'm in a cell
'Cos I can't be tamed
I be in Spain
One night I'm in Germany
Fly to Europe to Africa
Where a million heard of me
Certainly
I'm stressed
Gaining weight, getting dressed
In the same clothes
Busting all the same flows, blessed
That I made those blessed
Ate up those checks
And asked for mo' checks
Mo' sex, drugs, rock n roll
Pays a toll on the soul
'Til you ain't got a place to go
Next
And you end up soulless
And only Jesus can save you
Give you a halo
They say the rain's the tears of the infinite Angels

I'm surviving in the desert, it's painful
Sweating, ready to break fool
Ain't nothing refreshing as the rainfall
River slowing, seeds sprouting leaves
See me on the mountain peak
We was dripping way before the album leak
Staying cool under a lot of heat
Someday a real rain will come
And wash all this scum off the street
The climate change they deny with the same old lie
Make me wanna cry like the Double Rainbow Guy
The puddles offer some reflection for the camera shy
Cloudsteppa Federation from the Happy Skies
Catching flies with the chopsticks, leg sweeps and drop kicks
'Til the Sun rises in my optics
'Cos rainy days'll have your neck in a noose
Unless you're putting on your anorak and Wellington boots
Whether the weatherman is telling the truth, we weatherproof
Pennies from Heaven, putting your umbrella to use
Beautiful rain

Don't disturb me, beautiful rain (Oh, oh, oh)

I saw you standing there
I feel my heart beat
You light a cigarette

I'm only here for holiday
You smiled and looked away
“Why is Paris, so beautiful tonight?”
He said “not as beautiful as you”

And I don’t know where I am
Or what I'm doing here right now
And I don't have any idea who you are

Will you stay with me
Don’t leave me alone
Will you stay with me
Tonight, don't go

Tell me something I don't know
Raise your arms and part the sea
Teach me how to love myself
Show my heart, the way to bleed

And I don't know what I can do
About the way I feel right now
I can't be without you

Will you stay with me
Don't leave me alone
Will you stay with me
Tonight, don't go

I can withstand
Just about anything but losing you
If I can have
You then I just don't know what to do
Caught by surprise
The girl that I'm speaking of, she's walking out on me
Teardrops explode
Cracking the pavement under my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a sadness that creeps up
Every time you're far away
Put an end to this madness
Oh darling, I'm fading out

[Chorus]
There's nothing but you
You
There's nothing but you
You

[Verse 2]
Deserted again
Where are my friends? I can't rely on them
Seasick and soaked
Drowning my fears with flat coca cola
No bus ticket in hand
No change in my pocket, there is nothing left
And now it's Saturday night
I swear that it used to be better than this

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a sadness that creeps up
Every time you're far away
Put an end to this madness
Oh darling, I'm fading out

Ne me laissant que tes sandales

How to listen to your soul?

Won't just sit around and cry

Got 5 rings like Kobe
And I won an Oscar on Maury
Pussy niggas
Calling tha police [911. What's your emergency? Meeoooooww]

Of that Henney
Bumping Rocka outside the Bentley

Don't play games girl
Don't test me
Bet 3 million on my testes
And the bitch still can't get me like

Bitches looking mean
All this dank seems to be a dream
Pero no soy un fiend

Better be twerking on a nigga dick
Too slick not rich
But the bitch gon' be feeling it
No concealing it that she want it
Nigga in the zone

And these hoes get down
Bring a dozen roll ups
We about to smoke this down
And that's word to my nigga Rocka
Lets warn them then it's over
In the booth
Man we focused
In hopes of reaching them posters
Like we sposed to
But if it's not like that
Fuck it then this degree
Got my back
Like Arturo on the track
He just tossed me the gat
Now it's time to attack
All these wack ass niggas
Trynna claim that they rap
When they need to drop the mic
Cuz they garbage
And they ain't get a pick in this harvest of artists
So, just, stop, stop
And make way for the real
Puffing that pack
Fuck popping the pills
She said fuck me, and I'll suck your dick
I said it's a deal
Flow is surreal
Don't mind us
We just here for the beer
You can't handle yours
Then I'm going for the steal
Smoked a whole half
And you say you know
How I feel bitch

Lil' JoJo used to love to ball, that judge killed his dream (Killed his dream)
And Tyrone took one to the head, we used switch up rings
They did my nigga Heavy dirty, used to be so clean
They took Young Thad and all wanted to do was feed his team
Make it rain while the strippers drown in it
Moving bitch, you know the whole town hit it
Man bag with a tray pound in it
Lil' Runtz, know they straight down with it
Take to the playground with it
They wasn't even space to see, .223 make it hard to breathe
They gon' do you like Fabolous, how could the hood be mad at this?
How could them niggas go against this shit when I was telling them that I pictured this?
A cold bitch threw me in the cold and was standing over me while I was shivering
With the stick-up kids, I'ma still serve a nigga, I ain't shivering (Shivering)

Putting mad shit out with no manager

What twirls internally--
The possibility of you and me
My inner life converges
With the mystery of yours to learn
A whirlwind
Swirls within in this girl

We could be
Traveling in labyrinth and sea
Baby, don’t you see I’m fearless
Spinning, laughing in the breeze
I could walk down your memory lane
In the rain, see the valleys of your pain
Climbing mountains of your greatest days

Wanna know ya more
I’m down for the adventure
To read the map of your mind
And be right by your side

Make a move

You ooze that cool, calm vibe
Like music
Moving
Flyness infused, amused cruising
Don’t be afraid, hey
Swayed
Weighed down by the musings
Don’t dissuade yourself from grooving to the music
Are there cinders hindering movement?
Attuned, I’ll be here, babe
To hear the resolution

I could be yours
You could be mine
I could be your girl
You could be my man (X2

And I’ll always be wondering
How the world goes round
Just follow direction
And in this island you’ll be found

[Chorus]
It can be a long way to reach the green grass
Can seem like this highway wasn’t yours to travel down
An you’ll find this island beneath your feet at last
And understand the reasons For traveling in the past

[Verse 2]
Listening to the birds that fly around this place
Finally Hear the voice inside that speaks at its own pace
Those that livе around you  Finally share the space
Finally find a placе where 2 hearts can sing and chase

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ll always be wondering
How the world goes round
Just follow direction
And in this island you’ll be found

[Chorus]
It can be a long way to reach the green grass
Can seem like this highway wasn’t yours to travel down
An you’ll find this island beneath your feet at last
And understand the reasons For traveling in the past

It’s not you, it’s Q
Hey
Uh huh
Hey

[Verse 1]
Last time was the last, let so many niggas slide, put away my pride, they was talkin’ cash
That’s okay I got receipts, you can keep the change, now I’m on your ass
Yeah I read the good book, turn the other cheek, leave it in the past
Trying to play me like a dummy, I don’t find it funny, I’ma have to crash
First time was the first, ever since then I’ve been talking church
All a nigga know is praise, I just can’t behave, I been on my worst
Six feet under dirt, turn an open verse to a droven hearse
Bingo be the hitman, you just say thе word, I’ma get it murked, huh
Third time’s bе the charm, I ain’t waiting around, I’ma drop a bomb
Got the whole world sitting in my palm, I’ma sing about it like the book of psalms
People got to know the climate, you just can’t expect a nigga to be calm
Belly of the best, middle of the storm, never mind the weather, I’m in rare form
Let me help you understand, yeah you got a brand, it ain’t Ralph Lauren
Levels to it, young man, yeah you got hands, you ain’t George Foreman
Best believe he conquer what he came and saw
And to the victor goes the spoils so what I say is law
Hey

[Interlude: Leon, Franklin & Jerome]
I want you to listen to me, I been where you at, nigga
But you got to keep fighting, you hear me?
Yeah man, of course
Because this shit ain’t your fault
Believe me, it’s not
When you leave here, go back in that dorm, grab the first nigga you see and beat the fuck out that nigga until they grab you off of that nigga
You hear me? Show ‘em who the fuck you is, nigga
Aight, aight
No, look at this nigga face, man, fuck
Aight, aight
Show ‘em who the fuck you is

[Verse 2]
Nawfside, nigga, praise!
Mob ties, Michael Corleone, you know every man with me made
People calling me the pope, you know every soul with me getting saved
‘Bout to take it from remote to the whole globe, I ain’t finna play
Devils don’t want no smoke, you don’t roll with us, then you’re getting blazed
Getting better as I age like fine wine, so tend to your business, I mind mine
And don’t get offended if I get too busy, I don’t feel obliged to find time
I’ve been on my craft it’s fine-tuned, I’ve been on my path, a high climb
Be cautious you’re crossing a fine line
I’ve been on this math, they don’t know the half
Ain’t taking no stab at it, I’m established, check out the stats, baby, I got status
Never been with no median or average
Niggas be nearsighted, I ain’t nothing like it, I’ma take it where you can’t imagine
Ain’t got no gimmicks, I don’t do no acting, I just got skills, vision, and this passion
I’m from the H like a young rocket, I throw the 4, I got 4 pockets
Run up the score like I’m playing Madden, these niggas know about me, I got options
It’s gon’ be pinpoint if I pass it, do what you want with it when you poppin’
My brother home, we can get it cracking, straight at your dome with it, I ain’t stopping
Look

Tomara teus olhos vissem
O amor que trago por ti
Nem o entardecer me acalma...
Nem o entardecer me acalma...
Na ânsia de te ter aqui

E o teu perfume, o incenso
Os ecos de uma oração
Misturam-se num esboço imenso
Afogam-se na solidão

Fui para um templo de pedra
Escolhi um recanto isolado
Que me faça esquecer tua voz...
Esquecer-me da tua voz...
Que me faça acordar do passado

Escondida em sítio sagrado
E não me apetece o perdão
Devo estar enfeitiçada
Náufrago do coração

E o teu perfume, o incenso
Os ecos de uma oração
Misturam-se num esboço imenso
Afogam-se na solidão

Não sei se perdoo o meu fado
Não sei se consigo enfim
Um dia esquecer que teus olhos
Sorriem, mas não para mim

About the business of building empire
Killing the will of a windmill vision
Cuz we’re triggered, embittered, burdened, by litter
Mr. Sam’s invisible hand
Violating land
God-given command stands
Diggin' his fingers up in our figures
Winner, the one with the cheddar
Imposing free market, targeted dinners
And the sinners?
Been the children who didn’t listen and
Give in to babysitter’s decision

Mad scientist collab trap
Getting up all up in the grab
Setting up map attack
Mastering capitalist disaster
Treading up all up in collapse
Checkin' it, can’t retract the chapter
Can’t ignore the factor
To survive, privatize or die
Keep ya self in line
Now it’s go back to ya country
Uncle, what? Go back in time
Cuz ya trippin', sippin', slippin'
Ya missin' the contradiction
We escape the fate you placed
In waves ya fuel we come and stay

Para que quede re clarito

Scorning the foreign born
But you were warned
Settle then meddle
Ya sentimental for metal
Leveling seven cities—a legend
The nitty gritty ain’t pretty
Committee in windy city sent
Busybodies to hinder the builders
Sit up and listen, lesson of essence
In evanescence, the present second is pressing
Let’s set the record
In dispossession, the tension threatens, oppresses
Searching for shelter
Pedestrians reckon U.S. is better

'Cause I forgot my surgical mask
And it seems the town is with me
'Cause, man, the looks are shifty
I get from every person I pass (yup, sorry)

I'm just here to stock up on spirits
And get a few things for my home
So please can someone tell me
Why all the toilet paper's gone?

This ain't no time to be sober
There's a time and a place
To hide your face
And I've got nothin' but time to waste, yeah
Yеah, this ain't no time to be sober

I'vе had my fill of Zoom meetings
Emotional eatings
Since five o' clock arrivin' round noon (it's stone time)
And I swear this paranoia
Man, it can destroy ya
Every time I cough, I swear that I'm through

I'm like six feet from my sanity
Just tryin' to get back
And figure out why Carole Baskin
Fed her husband to that cat (oh, man)

This ain't no time to be sober
There's a time and a place
To hide your face
And I've got nothin' but time to waste, yeah

But now I'm sippin' vodka with the CDC, and

This ain't no time to be sober
This ain't no time to be sober
This ain't no time to be sober
There's a time and a place
To hide your face

With somebody else
I don’t know what good
Does it do to care

But if he hasn’t hugged you like I did
Can I still call you to be my friend?
If he hasn’t taken you out
Can I invite you for a drink?
If he hasn’t made you laugh yet
Can I come in?

[Verses]
When I walk into a room
You’re the first I turn to
And then I look the other way
Just when you look back
I delete our conversations
I ignore your validation
I don’t wanna lose my reason
But it’s too late for that

[Chorus]
But if he hasn’t hugged you like I did
Can I still call you to be my friend?
If he hasn’t bothered just enough
Can I take you for a spin?
If he hasn’t made you laugh yet
Can I come in?

[Bridge]
I didn’t wanna bring you home
Some part of me is still holding on
I don’t know how to be alone
I wish you didn’t come along
(There's times I wish you didn't come at all)

[Final Chorus]
But if he hasn’t given you reasons to stay
It shouldn’t be too hard to say
If he hasn’t told you a joke
Or messed up your clothes
Looking at you
While his eyes hold your breath
If hasn’t made you laugh
If he hasn’t made you cry
If he hasn’t made you smile
Yet
Can I come in?

Burning I exhale my fumes.
Taste my toxins as they flow past your teeth
Inhale me deeply, let your lungs scream.
  In a moment I’ll be gone.

Palimpsest. 

Residue.

Tar stained thumbs. 

I’ll always be around.
How many hours will it be,
Until regained, there is need for me,
Again intimate towards Fate’s ingress
Decisions that will aggregate, 
One or two at most, I bet. 
It’s not a test. I am the best
when you have nothing left to lose. 
Wouldn’t you choose
Your own death,
If you could?
It’s coming regardless.
A minutes run is all i’ll last,
fifteen will I shave away. 
I am not your last. 
Crawling towards an early grave
Name me your lucky
Flip me on my head
Luck never is enough
Unseen hands stained

     With Red

No one can stand your stench: 
An odious demise.
I will never be the last
Never to be that wise.
I will never be your last
I know addiction
I am addiction
and I am universal.

Sore throats:
Hoarse cattle prodded to the pins—

Arise,
Awaken.
No guarantee was made on life.
Disparity: Control was taken
Away,
Our Destinies Forsaken.

We moved but never left
‘Cause it’s over yeah we’re done
You said we had it all
But all we had was you
It was never room for us
Piece by piece, you've broken me

Now all there’s left to do
Is clean up all the pieces
I clean up after you
Until my love decreases

30,22072,Illusion,VIVID,"Nostalgia’s wisp fades to grey skies
Comfort buried beneath sodden frost
Living endlessly within this body, I dissociate into images of strangers
An outsider to my own life
Rays of salience never glow upon my skin
Following branches sent from the divine
A message obscured by discord of heart and mind

Everyday we grow further from the moment everything stood still
The intoxication I will chase until I die, whose colors become only less vivid, less true
Crumbling into soil to be forgotten, leaving nothing but the stench of eternal sickness
"
31,22099,Snake Charmer,Parov Stelar,"I hear some music far away
After a party night
As I'm walking through the city streets
I bump into this guy
He blows the whistle everyday
I hear it all the time
But everything changed
When I look into his eyes

I think he hypnotized me
I feel I have to dance
And every time he plays it
He puts me in a trance
I'm your black mamba lady
Slowly coming up
And hide back in my basket
When the music stops

Mister snake charmer
Playing on your flute
Let me crawl around you
Please play me a tune or two
Snake charmer
Playing on your flute
Let me crawl around you
Please play me a tune or two

Snake charmer
Playing on your flute
Let me crawl around you
Please play me a tune or two
Snake charmer
I'm your snake tattoo
Tell me what you want
And I'll do what you want me to do

I think he hypnotized me
I feel I have to dance
And every time he plays it
He puts me in a trance
I'm your black mamba lady
Slowly coming up
And hide back in my basket
When the music stops

But when I'm fed up dancing
I kill you with my venom
Don't think you can escape
I will find you with my tongue
And swallow you in one piece
When your completely numb
And look for other charmer man
To play that same old song

Mister snake charmer
Playing on your flute
Let me crawl around you
Please play me a tune or two
Snake charmer
Playing on your flute
Let me crawl around you
Please play me a tune or two

Snake charmer
Playing on your flute
Let me crawl around you
Please play me a tune or two
Snake charmer
I'm your snake tattoo
Tell me what you want
And I'll do what you want me to do
I'll do what you want me to do

Mister snake charmer
Playing on your flute
Let me crawl around you
Please play me a tune or two
Snake charmer
I'm your snake tattoo
Tell me what you want
And I'll do what you want me to do

Feel the music fold around you and pull you into the light
Feel how it takes away your strain and stress
And turns it into delight, just for tonight

Move to the beat if you can take it
Go ahead let your hands hit the ceiling
Move to the beat if you can't help it
It will control you and take you away, just for tonight

39,22134,Gingerbread Man,Dirty Honkers,"The air feels electric tonight
I'm walking out the door with style
Into the streets I take flight
The world lighting up as I walk on by

My destination is unclear
I'm on auto-pilot need not steer
I can't look back the hunter's on my track
Picking up my scent for miles and miles

So I skip and I hop then I run then I stop
Like a fox trotting all across the plains
Or a tramp jumping from train to train
Hide and seek it's just a matter of life
Come and get me baby, come and make my night

CHORUS

Come, come and get me
Catch me if you can Gingerbread man
Life, it's not easy
Run run with all your might

Ohhh foxxy, where you been hiding this time
It won't do you no good
Cause I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna get you this time

I'm nearing up around the bend
My sensor's going off, danger up ahead
Working hard into the night
All this game troubles on it's way
You should have watched your step
You should have placed your bet
On the other horse, cause I trot fast of course
Speed it up come on move your butt
Picking up the pace cause the chase is on

So I skip and I hop then I run then I stop
Like a fox trotting all across the plains
Or a tramp jumping from train to train
Hide and seek it's just a matter of life
Come and get me foxy, come and make my night

CHORUS

Come, come and get me
Catch me if you can Gingerbread man
Life, it's not easy
Run run with all your might

Put a little back into it

Looking out
The parting of the curtain
He’s feeling quite uncertain
‘Bout how he’s received

Stood in front of your fear
Heres your chance to appear
No turning back

Nows your time

Everybody told him
They always tried to hold him
Back from wasting his time

Its all eyes
The world and every nation
A legend in creation
To do it again

He was a cool man
He went to downtown abbey
He was a strong man
He had the city at his feet
Gold diggers around looking for his money
Whatever dollars or pounds he said put it on me
He could ask for everything
But he was on a string
His bullets weren’t thin
You can wonder
He was the poorest king (x2)
But in reality he had no one to call
Just a whore called Heidi
It was a great great fall

[Verse 2]
Living for his sins
Just looking for some hotties
Once he looked at his life
He cried and grab a knife
He planned to go upstairs
He was calm and ready
Sat on the prettiest chair
You can wonder
He’s about to do it (x2)
And with a steady hand he put the knife to his throat
He caused his own end
It was a great great fall

Oh mister mister

Anger you retain, pressure rocks you like a hurricane

We just came out of the hardest season
The last three months have been dark and freezing
All I’ve wanted to do is hide away
Because I swear humans are supposed to hibernate
“But Offbeat, what about New Years Eve?”
Well I guess that’s the one night I’m willing to leave
And proceed to Party Like It’s the 20's
Then it’s back to my bed sheets with my Tetley's
'Til I know for sure that the Winter’s done
And the cold and the rain has been switched for sun
We’ve got the swing 'cause that’s what we bring
To celebrate the fact that Spring has sprung!

[Chorus: Nina Zeitlin]
Sunny days and luscious leaves
That rustle in the subtle breeze
Singing birds and buzzing bees
Its Swing in Spring

Fluffy clouds that hover high
Up in the brightly colored sky
Flowers bloom and come alive
It’s Swing in Spring

[Verse 2: Offbeat]
It’s that time of year so get to know
But I think somebody needs to tell John Snow
That “winter’s coming”, nah it’s not
Spring is here and it’s getting hot
We’ve got the new tracks which are sure
To make you shake a leg til your limbs are sore
When Wolfgang tells you to hit the floor
You best listen 'cause this guy is the Lohr!
We love the Spring 'cause the days are longer
The sun blazes and the rays are stronger
But even when it’s over it ain’t a bummer
'Cause we know what’s coming next is the Summer!

[Chorus: Nina Zeitlin]
Sunny days and luscious leaves
That rustle in the subtle breeze
Singing birds and buzzing bees
Its Swing in Spring

Fluffy clouds that hover high
Up in the brightly colored sky
Flowers bloom and come alive
It’s Swing in Spring

[Bridge: Nina Zeitlin]
Swing in Spring!
Yeah!
Swing, swing
Swing, swing

[Chorus: Nina Zeitlin]
Sunny days and luscious leaves
That rustle in the subtle breeze
Singing birds and buzzing bees
Its Swing in Spring

Fluffy clouds that hover high
Up in the brightly colored sky
Flowers bloom and come alive
It’s Swing in Spring

Sunny days and luscious leaves
That rustle in the subtle breeze
Singing birds and buzzing bees
Its Swing in Spring

Fluffy clouds that hover high
Up in the brightly colored sky
Flowers bloom and come alive
It’s Swing in Spring

[Outro: Nina Zeitlin]
Swing in Spring!
Swing, swing
Swing in Spring!
Swing, swing

64,22166,Cinnamon Girl,[dunkelbunt],"I met her on the milky way
Who she was I could not say
I only knew I wanted to stay
Together we spent night and day

We used to fly through summer trees
The air was full of blossom breeze
Deep inhale this tasty smell
How many stories does it tell?

Hey my little Honey bee
Youre far﻿ away thats hurting me
I miss you darling far away your
Warm sweet smile this summer day

Je me trouve en plein hiver
De lautre côté de la terre
Jai trop froid sans ta chaleur
Jen ai besoin pour mon bonheur

En pleurant je compte﻿ les jours
Comme tu me manques mon amour
Bientôt on faira des voyages
Dans le ciel sur les nuages

It's time to leave to say good bye
Please oh darling dont ask why
After the sun comes rain dont cry
Remember our days in the sky

My heart is bleeding every day
Since we had t 'say fare well
I still can taste your tender skin
It smelled so good like cinnamon

Hey my little Honey﻿ bee
Youre far away that's hurting me
I miss you darling far away your
Warm sweet smile this summerday

65,22154,Looking Like This,Lyre Le Temps,"[Chorus]
Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?
No not at all, you can't control
You think I'm showy, but I'm not at all
Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?
In my world, swing is swag
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

[Verse 1]
I'm wearing some bling-bling made by Gucci
Riding a 305 ferrari
Cross me somewhere in the street
Maybe I would just look at your feet
Without a 300-dollar pair of shoes
Don't even think you're gonna talk to me, you're a fool
You can cry, or maybe you can die
Okay you won't die, but we know you will cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, I'm just way too far
I can't explain to you
Man, I'm just way too far
I'm just too good for you
Man, I'm just way too far
I can't explain to you
Man, I'm just way too far
I'm just too good for you

[Chorus]
Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?
No not at all, you can't control
You think I'm showy, but I'm not at all
Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?
In my world, swing is swag
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

You are more stupid than my dog
Have you got my shit?
You look as ugly as a frog
Have you got my shit?
You have no subject when you talk
Have you got my shit?
I'm so clever, got it locked
Have you got my shit?

[Verse 2]
Oh, fuck off
I heard he's a jerk
You call him a jerk?
He's an asshole
I call him a douchebag, man
Give me a break
You will need to make your personality
Please, and you will uh, witness one of the great miracles of life

[Chorus]
Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?
No not at all, you can't control
You think I'm showy, but I'm not at all
Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?
In my world, swing is swag
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

You are more stupid than my dog
Have you got my shit?
You look as ugly as a frog
Have you got my shit?
You have no subject when you talk
Have you got my shit?
I'm so clever, got it locked
Have you got my shit?

[Verse 3]
I was kidding; I've never worn no Gucci
I'm a badass, not a douchebag, sorry
Would you give me just one more chance
So I can propose you up for one more dance
Tell me what you see if you look a bit closer
I'm a good guy not some kind of fucker
Watch your mouth, leave the rest untold
I'm only nice, when I'm under control

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, it went way too far
I can't explain to you
Man, I went a way too far
I'm just as good as you

[Chorus]
Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?
No not at all, you can't control
You think I'm showy, but I'm not at all
Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?
In my world, swing is swag
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?
No not at all, you can't control
You think I'm showy, but I'm not at all
Am I looking like this?
Tell me, am I looking like this?

Do you like me?
Do you dig what you see?
People say I’m flirtatious
And a little too audacious

I guess that lately
I’m showing off, and baby
People say I’m flirtatious
Can’t you see that you’re the reason why?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oooh) Since when I met you
Things ain’t been the same (do-do-do-wop)
Maybe if I could get you
I’d be cool again!

[Chorus]
If you like me
Hurry up and show me
People say I’m flirtatious
Just a little too outrageous

Don’t keep me always hangin’ on
Make up your mind
People say I’m flirtatious
But you don’t see I’m flirting with you!

Oh honey, what do I have to do to make you see that it’s you that I want?
I don’t care about anyone else!
If I’m sighing and crying
If I’m forward, well I sure wouldn’t mind you being a little bit [?] for me

[Verse 2]
Don’t be weary
If you find me scary
People say I’m flirtatious
It’s becoming quite contagious!

And if I dare you
To come and play a little
People say I’m flirtatious
Can’t you see that you’re the reason why?

There's a Peeping Tom sat outside my window
He's been there for days
And now it's only gone and gotten onto Sunday

Open up your eyes real wide
'Cause Peeping Tom, I've got a big surprise

So, I slide across my hood, and what do I see?
Sure as hell, the Peeping Tom is looking at me
So, I simply, accidentally, carelessly
Drop my dressing gown for him to see
So, Peeping Tom, keep on looking at me
Peeping Tom tell me
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see, what do- what do you see?

70,22193,Geraldines Routine,Tape Five,"[Verse 1]
There was a cat from Brooklyn, by the name of Romeo
His folks, they came from Italy, many years ago
One night, he met young Geraldine, a dame from outta town
When Geraldine was dancing she would bring the ballroom down

[Chorus]
Wave those paws in the air
Spin around like Fred Astaire
Slip me five and we can jive
That's Geraldine's routine

Lift those puppies off the ground
Swing those hips, and shake them down
(It's rag, it's razz, it's snazzy jazz)
It's Geraldine's routine

Wave those paws in the air
Spin around like Fred Astaire
Slip me five and we can jive
That's Geraldine's routine

Lift those puppies off the ground
Swing those hips, and shake them down
(Let's hump, let's jump, let's thumpety-bump)
It's Geraldines routine

[Verse 2]
Her mama was a stripper, and so was Geraldine
She learned to strip at Mardi Gras, way down in New Orleans
Romeo was whacky, he was dizzy for this dame
He learned a dance and got the chance to be Geraldine's new flame

Wave those paws in the air
Spin around like Fred Astaire
Slip me five and we can jive
That's Geraldine's routine

Lift those puppies off the ground
Swing those hips, and shake them down

Okay, here she comes ladies and gentlemen
Here comes Geraldine
Look out guys
Shake that thing, ha ha!

78,22194,Very Nice People,DJ Mibor,"[Verse 1: Offbeat]
You roll up to the club in a stretched-out limousine
Designer clothes, tight shirt and skinny jeans
Haircut even you can't take seriously
But everybody in there knows you're a VIP
Sitting in the booth like a man of stature
Posing and pouting in front of the cameras
Spending a grand on a bottle of champers
You could've bought for ten pounds at Asda
Only one thing weaker and that's the banter
Girls whose skin that looks the same as fanta
You should've really come to spend a night with me
You would've had more fun in the VNP

[Chorus: Offbeat]
Very nice people (Yeah man)
Very nice people (You know it)
Very nice people
It's all about the VNP

Very nice people (Uh huh)
Very nice people (That's right)
Very nice people
It's all about the VNP

[Verse 2: Offbeat]
I roll up to the club with a clapped-out Uber
With half a pint, I smuggled-out a boozer
Dressed in Primarni shirt and jeans
'Cause I don't need brand names, but my self-esteem
There's no red rope or table service
Or famous people the brain is worshiped
Just makes you think to have a great night out
'Cause in the end of the day, that's what it's all about
The music's better and the drinks are cheap
So I hope by now you can clearly see
There is nice to be important, but I'm sure you'll agree
It's important to be nice and a VNP

[Chorus: Offbeat]
Very nice people (Yeah man)

81,22161,Dance With Me,Dirty Honkers,"[Intro: Narrator]
The street lamp shadow poured into the alley
Like a shot out of a mystery thriller romance flick
No sound but the paper trash dancing in the city smoke
Reminding me I'm out of cigarettes
""This must be hell"" I thought as I rest my back on the brick wall
Waiting for nothing to happen

When suddenly a big bright yellow Cadillac came gushing out of the main street, stopping right in front of me, a compelling voice crept out the back seat

""Hey there stranger, looks like you need a drink. Climb in!""
Desperate and curious I got in the car, not long after screeching to a halt, in front of a big door with nеon lights...

[Verse 1: Lady]
Open up the front door, no you come through thе back
Keep the liquor flowing all bound to attack
Where you going kiddy no time to stray-hey-hey-hey-hey
Can I get a ""haihoo"", from the freak side on the dance floor?
Holler at me, and let me know
Do you like a swing time would you like some more?

Step up and shake ya tail feathers
Put your left and right together
Clap your hands now to the beat
Tonight we're gonna dance 'till we bring the heat!

Come on big boy, play that jazzy song
Hit that note, wear that horn
Sing it all night long

Come on big boy, play that song for me
Grab that trumper, then make it buzz
Like a bumblebee

Come on, play-y i-it, play-y i-it, play-y i-it
Come on, play-y i-it, play-y i-it, play-y i-it

[Vers 2: Narrator]
Pretty girls, of all sorts
With matching handbags and skirts surrounded the bar
As my hostess paraded around
Hanging on to my arm like a movie star

And dragging me towards the back room
Where the jazz band on-stage played a hot tune
And everybody started to move like cartoons
Hooked by the rhythm like a sharp harpoon

As I noticed of the corner of my eye
Mister Jack Melone giving me the evil eye
He runs half of the clubs in town, you see
And for some reason I feel like he don't like me

He comin' our way with intent to harm
My hostess quickly noticed and grabbed my arm
Pulled me up on stage and started to dance
I guess this the story of some bad romance

[Chorus: Lady + Narrator]
Step up and shake ya tail feathers
Put your left and right together
Clap your hands now to the beat
Tonight we're gonna dance 'till we bring the heat!

[Bridge: Narrator, off-beat]
And there I am in the middle of all this mess
Tryin' to get away from this madman
Right on the band-stand with nowhere to go

I don't know how to play that!
[Trumpet Lady:] Oh, well, you better learn fast

As I noticed of the corner of my eye
Mister Jack Melone giving me the evil eye
He runs half of the clubs in town, you see
And for some reason I feel like he don't like me

He comin' our way with intent to harm
My hostess quickly noticed and grabbed my arm
Pulled me up on stage and started to dance
I guess this the story of some bad romance

[Chorus: Lady + Narrator]
Step up and shake ya tail feathers
Put your left and right together
Clap your hands now to the beat
Tonight we're gonna dance 'till we bring the heat!

[Bridge: Narrator, off-beat]
And there I am in the middle of all this mess
Tryin' to get away from this madman
Right on the band-stand with nowhere to go
[Trumpet Lady:] Here, grab a trumpet and blow some smoke
I don't know how to play that!
[Trumpet Lady:] Oh, well, you better learn fast
Oh boy
I guess I got no choice
[Ladys:] Blow Johnny, Blow
Here we go

[Chorus: Lady]
Come on big boy, play that jazzy song
Hit that note, wear that horn
Sing it all night long

Come on big boy, play that song for me
Grab that trumper, then make it buzz
Like a bumblebee

Come on, play-y i-it, play-y i-it, play-y i-it
Come on, play-y i-it, play-y i-it, play-y i-it

Hey, brother, what you thinkin'? Leave that old record spinning
You feel the rhythm going (Wasn't gonna marry, til-uh)
Legs ain't got time to lay low, your knees are bending and so
It's time to get up and let go (Stick to the promise girl that)

[Verse 2]
Hey, mama, how's it going? Can't see your body moving
Don't leave the party dying (Wasn't gonna marry, til-uh)
Keep booty shaking, you know, your head has no right to say ""No""
Tonight it's ""Ready, set, go!""

Baby, can you move around the rhythm so we can get with 'em
Jump around, and get us a rock and roll 'round
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
Let's go, real slow, hell no
Baby, can you move around the rhythm, 'cause you know
We're living in the fast lane, speed up, it ain't no game
Just turn up all the beams, when I come up on the scene

What goes on when it gets late
Long about midnight, and ghosts, and banshees
Get together for a jamboree

101,22245,Scruffy,Dutty Moonshine,"One, Two!
Coming in with the Moonshine business!
Here we go
I shine right through with the lyrics on tap
I'm about to conjure up yet another Dutty rap
For the duo that you know infused in the swing vine
Bring out the ding in the music they swing line
Wax burning like mercury purring I'm lyrically inferring
And circling like murley
With a boom, fizz, a bass, smash, hush
When I'm curling up my tongue around the tyrants of a brush
Raves wontcha MC Charlie D about to bonta never again to falter
My toes gunna smolder poetry I'm pulling from my holster
Well ponta with your feet and knees
Let's Bounce
The hinge of the industry sings
Electro with a vintage twinge
Let's bounce
The hinge of the industry sings
Electro with a vintage twinge
Let's bounce
Let's bounce
Let's bounce
Let's bounce
Once again
You want to hear a rhythm from my lyrical den of iniquity
Then I will spin for thee
When I get up the sound wave for some bars
I keep think up some ways to make this more lyrically enhanced
Rummaging around in the chest of my experience
I'm digging up some images that will render you delirious
I feel the glow
Cause the glint in my eye
With a wink I should think I steal my future from the sky
My mental capacity is hiding in a cavity
That only permits me to think the imaginary
Of all the detail of the goings on around me
Anything numerical continues to confound me
Things and stuff just wanna bound me
Fumbling together different atoms of their boundaries
I keep getting lost in conciseness flocks
Buried in the rhythm I bash my clocks
Let's Bounce!
Let's bounce!
Let's Bounce!
Let's bounce!
Bounce now
Let thump with the rhythm of Dutty catechism
Pouring out double gizem of a snake intermission
When I work with this
Deliciousness
When I flick my wrist getting mischievous
Let's bounce
The hinge of the industry sings
Electro with a vintage twinge
Like a old stand suburb or an tombstone home
Try Dutty moonshine
Now get it really loose
And Bounce!
Try Dutty moonshine
Now get it really loose
And Bounce!
Try Dutty moonshine
Now get it really loose
Find Bounce!
Try Dutty moonshine
Now get it really loose
Find Bounce!
Try Dutty moonshine
Now get it really loose

102,22235,Otto Croy,OdjBox,"(Think you know the story, but this one's different)

[VERSE]
Meet Tommy, a family man
Doesn't do much, or work, was dealt a comfortable hand
His family have given him the world upon a platter
Showered him with love and taught him how family is what matters

His friends often joke about what might catch his eye
But, no one knew that it would only take a couple lines
In the newspaper, a short piece about how this village girl
Had made her own brand in Italy and sold it around the world

Her story lingers, and so he writes a letter
States business and how thеy should meet in person to talk better

So now wе meet Loretta a lord of the law to be reckoned with
Her family chucked her out when she was still only a kid
Had nothing to her name, until she made sure she did
She built her own ground, that she stands upon
She don't got time for this

While this young gun is instantly besotted
Driven, wowed by this woman and the passion that he spotted
She is interesting and sharp, dominant and level headed
Don't need anything from anyone
This woman is a weapon

He's makes his big advance, but is instantly shot down
As she states quite certain she don't need people around
Especially not him, where's his passion and his drive?
Where's his longing for achievements, that inspire or reprieve?

Her words lingered like bullets in our Tommy's chest
And he knew that now he had some issues to address

[Chorus]
Think you know the story, but this one's different
Different touch, different times, different wisdoms
Different loves, different us, different systems
If only these two had kept their distance

When you look at me, can you tell me what you see?
Can you tell me what this means?

[VERSE]
So, he reflects upon this latest berating
And pretty instantly concludes that effort is worth making
She becomes his passion and her spirit builds his drive
His family and friends can barely believe their eyes

For the first time in forever, they see him come to life
And they want to meet the girl who has inspired this
Passion for success and money
Ain't it funny, it's almost like Loretta made Tommy (made Tommy)

This Chicago typewriter keeps typing his letters
Cooking up campaigns and deals to make her business better
And time goes by this weapon can't ignore
The change in this man as they talk more

She discovers what it is to be loved
Until this time she didn't know what that was
Tommy teaches tenderness, Loretta lets him in
That's how their romance begins

[Chorus]
Think you know the story, but this one's different
Different touch, different times, different wisdoms
Different loves, different us, different systems
If only these two had kept their distance

When you look at me, can you tell me what you see?
Can you tell me what this means?

[VERSE]
They become inseparable
Soulmates not just lovers
She lets her walls down, like she has for no others
And shot by shot they take over the world

With nothing to hold them back, and no lessons to learn
Their confidence turns to arrogance
And they start to shoot down every single person who don't agree with their plans
As their successes grow, they barely notice the world changes
Darkness, rivalry, and wars begin to rage

And Tommy's family fears the pair have grown too strong
And worry that the damage they inflicted now can't be undone
And so they plot on how to remove Loretta
In the hopes it will make their boy better

And so one day, at the height of their fame
Top of their game, she's given talks on the stage
And from in the wings her love gives a wink and wave
And then in the crowd she sees his family take aim

[GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMS]

She's screaming, bleeding out, she hears the shouts
And as she's running through this smoky jungle on her knees she's crouching, fallen, running faster and faster as fast as she can go
Eyes swollen in her throat, so long that she's scared that she might choke

But chokings nothing, her lover has torn her heart into two
She trusted him, but now he's gone and done what she feared he would do
And now he is running, and to say he is confused is an understatement
Never thought love for his family would so quickly turn to hatin'

Sheer panic courses through him as he searches for Loretta
For ever since he's met this woman, his life has been so much better
He sees a door and bustles through it desperately
And in it he sees his lover and falls relieved onto his knees

He crawls towards her, but she moves away
He gauges what she is thinking, and then goes to say
But, she quickly interrupts him as a tear rolls down her cheek
There is no way she is going to let him speak

She steadies her hand and pulls the trigger
One last breath as his eyes flicker
She lays down with him and she cries at her loss
As his brothers staggers in to find the target they lost

Tommy and Loretta had it all; love, fear, and fortune
Makes it more painful when you fall
Ears ringing, she falls defeated and weak
She curses Tommy and then kisses his cheek

[Chorus]
Think you know the story, but this one's different
Different touch, different times, different wisdoms
Different loves, different us, different systems
If only these two had kept their distance

When you look at me (When you look at me)
Can you tell me what you see?
Can you tell me
Can you tell me
Can you tell me what this means?

Laced in pleasures i crave

Steal you away bye bye
Bruise your ego
And your pride
Let our worlds collide

Now missing you like a Motherfucker
Call my earth due
One more chance if you let me in your circle
I promise not to do or say anything hurtful
Seeing you the at the gate weigh heavy on my mind
Besides it seems like a mighty long time

[Piano]

[Verse 2]
When the sun comes up
'Cause in San Pellegrino
I never want to give this up
'Cause I'm a fiend for your company
Shots of espresso with conversation
Which is elevation in my stimulation
Nothing changed since we dated
In fact, more elated
That now we're related, kids, house, you the spouse now
I'm worried 'Cause I'm spending more time, on the couch
I know the way that you have when your mind doesn't mouth
It's been a few years since we have all in rain
I know the sunshine hasn't take away the pain
I just miss you now and the light in your heart
It's crazy to be together
Yet feel so apart
I feel helpless
Because I can't heal your wounds
See the grief on your face as you lay in the room
There's no amount of liquor or trees I can consume
To take my mind of what it is your going through
And I promise I'll be the for you
Know that I will care for you
Every single night before I rest I say a prayer for you
You're one of a kind, a rare dime of a lifetime
I want what we have, to exist beyond a pipeline
The time any measurements a man can't count
My unconditional love in infinite amounts
For you my whole everything
You still rock the wedding ring
When I ain't have anything
You're the reason I'm a king

(Heavy on my mind)
(You're the reason I'm a king)
(Seems like a mighty long time)
(You're the reason I'm a king)
(Seeing you at the gateway, heavy in my mind)
(When the sun comes up)

You're not free, baby

You need to be a separated man
Should I keep the fight
Or trust my inner guide
That drags me to your light

You're playing with my fire
I'm under your spell, and you can tell
You're all that I desire

See the light far away is shining
I can see no end see no gate to this tunnel
Sella sell a bottle isn't working
Cops back my steps
They sent the vigilante
Always behind my back
Find a cover's handy
I'm not a rookie and can find something surely
People know me since the bank robbery

I can dance and I can sing too
Bring me to the pub where the party gets full full
I can drive, I will jive just let me bring some stuff to hide
Men you will dance you will sing too
I'll bring you where the money is due due due
But keep the cover lets call it a band
And in the bass put in the beers instead
Shht don't tell anyone it's our secret
A prohibited crime line we doing it for the best
Just keep up with a hard life run a couple dollars
But what we sell keep it under the radar
In music there's no season
The perfect suit from Chicago straight to Boston
Let's find a way to reveal you how
How much the show is gonna be messy and loud

We are the party raiser OH Jazzy flavors
Always on the road can I ask you a favor
Party raiser don't waste anytime trust me mister agent my papers are fine

Under the moon, the road is silent
But we'll know soon it'll stop bein quiet
Don't forget, we travel under that name
Whe are going there for music and it's always the same
No weapons no thug need to make the distance
No shout and no shots we do no resistance

122,22243,The Cat Came Back,Luca Lento,"Old Mr. Johnson had problems of his own
He had a little cat that just wouldn't leave his home
He tried and he tried to give the cat away
He gave it to a little man going far far away...
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back. They thought he was goner
But the cat came back. He just wouldn't stay away
He gave it to a little boy with a dollar note
He told the boy to take the cat up river on a boat
The boat turned over and was never found
And now they drag the river for the little boy who drowned...
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back. They thought he was goner
But the cat came back. He just wouldn't stay away
The man around the corner said he'd shoot the cat on sight
He loaded up his shotgun full of nails and dynamite
He waited... and he waited... 'till the cat came walking round
And ninety-seven pieces of the man was all they found...
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back. They thought he was goner
But the cat came back. He just wouldn't stay away
The H-bomb fell the very next day
The A-bomb fell in the very same way
Russia went! England went! And then the USA
The entire human race was left without a chance to pray...
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back. They thought he was gone
But the cat came back. He just wouldn't stay away

125,22254,As You Will,Wolfgang Lohr,"[Verse 1: Offbeat]
You roll up to the club in a stretched-out limousine
Designer clothes, tight shirt and skinny jeans
Haircut even you can't take seriously
But everybody in there knows you're a VIP
Sitting in the booth like a man of stature
Posing and pouting in front of the cameras
Spending a grand on a bottle of champers
You could've bought for ten pounds at Asda
Only one thing weaker and that's the banter
Girls whose skin that looks the same as fanta
You should've really come to spend a night with me
You would've had more fun in the VNP

[Chorus: Offbeat]
Very nice people (Yeah man)
Very nice people (You know it)
Very nice people
It's all about the VNP

Very nice people (Uh huh)
Very nice people (That's right)
Very nice people
It's all about the VNP

[Verse 2: Offbeat]
I roll up to the club with a clapped-out Uber
With half a pint, I smuggled-out a boozer
Dressed in Primarni shirt and jeans
'Cause I don't need brand names, but my self-esteem
There's no red rope or table service
Or famous people the brain is worshiped
Just makes you think to have a great night out
'Cause in the end of the day, that's what it's all about
The music's better and the drinks are cheap
So I hope by now you can clearly see
There is nice to be important, but I'm sure you'll agree
It's important to be nice and a VNP

Very nice people (Yeah man)

[Intro 1: Producer Tag]
Finny Music

[Intro 2: DJ Paul]
Who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
These niggas got plenty Anna but they ain't got plenty guns
I'm bustin' out luxury cars, still got these hoes on the run
I'm hearin' plenty mean words, but ain't no actions to boot
We can do some straight war for war, we can do some stickin' and movin'
We can meet in the middle of these streets or in the middle of this ring
I can pop your chest, plastic Glock, or pop your jaw diamond rings
Bitch don't hate me hate the bank, for stacks of cheese that I take
Or hate my shiny wristband, and big ass rims I rotate
See people flip when I'm comin', got suckas sick at the stomach
They wonderin' what I brought in, they wonderin' what I got comin'
Niggas I'm comin' like this, off in your mouth like a bitch
Trust me when you think of me, I'm bringing water, I'll start it

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
What's the business?
It's that player that you love to hate, always see come out the bank
Always have to mention my name, when you high on that drank
Catch up with this boy you can't, cause you know I'm holdin' rank
When you see the platinum Rolex with the ice it make you faint
Through the streets now have you heard, 'bout the Mafia droppin' birds
Runnin' from the narcs and cops, tossin' out the bags of herb
Ain't afraid to pop the steel, hollow tips to make you feel
If you wanna punk me out, Cartier's and a Dracula grill

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
I can't take anymore, I'm 'bout to explode
I'm 'bout to overload, I'm 'bout to get it, boy
All I wanna know is where the G's at, where the key's at
Keep it easy, you don't want to get skeeted
All on this motherfuckin' room, nigga, boom
Lay down on your back so you can get up soon
Stab you in your heart with a har-fuckin-poon
Nigga, boom, nigga, boom

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow's on it, I'm still hungry, starvin' for a platinum supper
Wipe it easy, some black founded, crooked ass set'll be eating rubber
'Cause if they skit-skat, gun 'em all down, even ghost towns
Splish-Splash, brains on the ground, with a cannon round
Ball bat, bash him in his back, beatin' bitches down
Battleaxe blaze from the cross, body never found
Catch a close encounter cause the Anna kills off these rap bums
Chemical reaction cobra venom shot into his arm

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These...
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 5: Gangsta Boo]
Here we go, all you weak ass hoes
In my face like you my friend
Triple Six dropped in again, time to make ends
Dope game, my game, hoes lame, it's a shame
How that Gangsta Boo is runnin' the click up on you bitches man
Fat cat, what I be, packin', how you love that
Fuck a platinum plaque, gimme money, where the dollars at
(Blap, blap) You're dead in a second for 10 G's
(Where you from?) Black haven is where I be on my P's and Q's

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Parents please, watch out for your children
This the one that'll lock 'em in the basement
Some of them talkin' so rugged, some corrupted ugly pussa-pussa
Close your fucking mouth, my nigga, Koopsta tryin' to tell ya somethin'
Peter-Peter, pussy eater, one of them fucked by Koopsta Knicca
Lord, I done some sins, cause she married, but I don't know that nigga
Figured he is a killa, so he figures he'll watch us fuckin'
Put them muthafuckin' slugs upside that thug, cuz, oh my

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, the-these, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 7: Juicy J & DJ Paul]
For that dick game, wouldn't buy your bitch with my loose change
Thirsty niggas eatin' bitches ass with the shit stain
Insane like my motherfuckin' wrist game, nigga
Houses on the hill cost the same fuckin' thing
Counted up a hunnid this mornin'
Then I went spent me 50
Then I hit the VLive, tryna buy me some ass and titties
Rappers sample my old shit, keep runnin' 'em bags, I'm uh rich
Get 'em samples cleared 'cause that publish you might not get some
Niggas act like they don't owe me somethin'
I'm the reason bitches twerkin' they ass, now show me somethin'
Payin' homage is a real nigga move, bitch I paid my dues
Sold a million out the trunk, you niggas uber poo
Pour that mud up like that butter, first nigga with that pipe in the club
Used to have to turn my shit up, had niggas tryna fight in the club
Y'all leaving with them, we hit them hoes right in the club
And I know I'm icy'd up, pinky just like that dub
You gotta like my shit, you a hater or somethin'
I'm a grown ass man, you a baby or somethin'
Probably fucked yo mama on the come up in the 80's, homie
Don't you ever try to play me, homie
Got a wife now like Kanye
And I wish a bitch would try to bite her like Beyonce
My daughter 2 months and she been paid
Boutta sign more deals, cop more real estate
Me and Pat used to rob for 'em petty things
Now it's nothin' less than private jets, 7 figure checks
Hater, catch yo fuckin' breathe, you broke, ain't got nothin' left
We them niggas in Dubai from the north, don't you ever flex
Mafia, runnin' shit, Juicy J ain't never quit
Ain't a bitch I never hit, still countin' paper, bitch
When the smoke clears, nigga, I'm still here
Higher than I been in 20 goddamn years, uh
Motherfuckin' legend get your smoke right, dope right (Who run it)
Ain't no conversation for that broke life, show right,  (Who run it) bitch

[Verse 8: CupcakKe & DJ Paul]
Let me talk my shit real quick (Who run it), all the real niggas gon' feel this
How that's yo' kid but he ain't got bills? Can't find you in family pics
Food stamps, they go so quick when you up in a family of six
So it's funny how they sell that shit for a little pack of weed and a new pair of kicks
Man, I'm so dead, I can't, inside I feel so blank
Little girls on Twitter talkin' 'bout they break up, girl, sit back on Paint
If I'm alive, no complaints, none of these judges saints
Let the black beat her, that's 10 years, but if white beat her, ""nice tank""
It's so ridiculous, ain't shit funny, ain't ticklish
Don't test me if I'm with the shits, end up in a cage, no Nicholas
Everything about me is interesting, I'ma need more and more Benjamins
Damn, I can't breathe, stop smoking them trees, got your insides looking like Christmas
Ungrateful hoes, get the fuck out of here, you had a rough day and I had a rough year
So when I get money I really do care, go and invest it, not spending on gear
Think about that, just stating facts, niggas don't chart when it's real rap
Earn my respect then you get it right back, that go hand in hand ain't talkin' dap
A lot of issues in my past still hurt me to this day, to the core
I don't ever open up 'cause I know people change like the oil
Over 100k up on tour, still got a mindset like I'm poor
But I'm on the roll when it come to rappin' like a pack of aluminum foil
Man, I love walking barefoot, I really like the feel when I'm at the bottom (what?)
'Cause I know it's only for a couple of seconds, then I'm right back to my stardom (that's right)
Motherfuckers ain't woke, man, I gotta fuck around and re-alarm 'em
I'm woke all day, 3 AM, when they call me Jake from State Farm
Okay, lil' bitch, act like you know, anything I say is right like nose
Walk right over there, hoe, like roach, and it's over for these hoes, no dose
Walk in that bitch with a white T, they don't really like me but you know how that goes
Walk out that bitch you would think I'm little red riding hood, how I got blood on my clothes

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 9: G Herbo]
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, ""Gang-gang first,"" you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
""Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried""
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young to sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, not one day, your honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to Bali, get a brib, I’m ballin
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, ""Fuck it, no problem, it'll do""
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)
I seen ten niggas get killed
What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh)
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?

[Interlude: G Herbo]
Uh, who run it? Limit
No Limit run it
No Limit man
No Limit
Who run it? G Herbo
I'm done with this shit

[Verse 10: Lil Uzi Vert]
Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me
Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'
This bust down, tryna scare us or some'
Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'
What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'
Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'
Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'
Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'
Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch
You think I'ma miss that?
Man she sucked Meen's dick and she sucked Rock's dick
So you think I'ma kiss that?
I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose
Told her I ain't with that
Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck
Mean you better give your wrist back
Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at
Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that
Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh
I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch (facts)
Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out
Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back
Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat
Car so foreign got an engine in the back
Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada
With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched
Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy
In Chiraq, 150, be strapped
Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back
Gun loud, backyard party, kick back
How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?
Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats
Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks
After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax
Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island
You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing
Said, ""Elliot, bezel it,"" ice kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains
Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion
On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'
You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'
She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'
I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 11: 21 Savage]

I'm on Percocet's, I think I'm finna skydive (yeah)
You little pussycat, you must think you got nine lives (21)
I'm so sick of all this fruity shit, you niggas on thin ice
That stick gon' cut you half-time, now these niggas wanna switch sides (straight up)
I ain't really with that takin' shit, lil' nigga, I'm walkin' up (straight up)
That .30 like a tree lil' nigga, watch where you barkin' up (straight up)
We got way too many shots, y'all lil' niggas can't dodge enough (on God)
We can even challenge ya, 'cause y'all lil' niggas ain't charged enough (fast)
Quarter million dollar for a walkthrough (straight up)
Get the utmost respect when I walk through (straight up)
I love the way you suck that dick, lil' bitch, don't forget who taught you (straight up)
Way too much, can't stalk you (straight up)
Bogeyman, nigga, I'll haunt you (on God)
All these bullets 'round me, nigga, I ain't got time to punch you (21)
Hit 'em wit' the 3-2, all y'all niggas see through (yeah)
Broad day, I'll see food, had to hit a lick at Kiku (yeah-yeah)
Lil' bitch I don't need you (yeah-yeah)
Hell Nah, I can't eat you (yeah-yeah)
Let the whole gang G you, then I left that bitch at Jeju (yeah-yeah)
You must be scared or some, nigga, let's bet the spread or some (21)
That's your main bitch, but I bet that lil' bitch spread for some (on God)
I got all these blues like I ain't bangin' red or somethin' (trre)
I bought all these cars like l ain't got no legs or somethin' (yeah)
Fuck that other side, pull up in ya hood switch it (21)
Sex, money, murder, two guns, nigga, big B's (21)
Every time I hit that bitch she come back like a frisbee (yeah)
I ain't got time to play with nobody kids, go watch Disney (yeah)
Skin made of concrete, nigga, you can never be me (21)
My brother down the road with a touchscreen and a FeFe (BF)
Candlelight gang, leave a nigga on the TV (21)
Fish fry gang, y'all can't even afford to die
Bitch, I'm way too real, I can't even afford to lie

[Verse 12: A$AP Rocky]
Make a bitch wanna stare or something
Niggas stare, you queer or somethin'?
You's a bitch, yeah we stay done
Chose a whip but I'm staying sunny
Diamonds sunny like I'm Cher or something
Smiley faces with the glasses
Fashion brands invite you to Paris
Boy you late that's a demerit, dang it
Get fucking maggot brain having
Rappers claiming the trap and the fashion
They only got Louis and the trap
I'm causing the flood and the traffic
The way that you be moving is whack
All of them rumors is facts
They've been in clap for the clap back
Your baby mama a nag nag
Nag nag nag nag nag nag...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 13: Trippie Redd]
Lil' nigga let them llamas fly, leave a young nigga so traumatized
Totin' gats jit, all my niggas ride
Don't make me make another mama cry
Do a drill, catch another homicide
Fix your face, nigga, you got butterflies?
Chopper at your throat and you afraid to die
Big 14, fuck the other side
Jugg, jugg, got all this jewelry
Man, this shit ain't new to me
Your bitch new to you, she ain't new to me
I ain't really with the fucking foolery
Glistenin' in these fucking diamonds
Bad bitch and I'm fucking shining
I got a bad bitch from the fucking islands
Taking trips to the fucking islands
Guess these guys don't realize
When they talking fly, man, it's suicide
Don't talk, do a nigga do or die
Nobody else, nigga, you and I
Big chopper, I'ma let the bullets fly
That red dot right between your eyes
I don't play, pussy, wish a nigga try
'Cause that'd be the night niggas die
Niggas act like I ain't G.O.A.T. or somethin'
Take a trip, go chill with the bros or somethin'
Call a few bitches, chill with some hoes or somethin'
Niggas be flexin', they bold or somethin'
They don't want that war, go home or somethin'
Internet flexin' with the phone or somethin'
You a lil' pup, nigga, fetch a bone or somethin'
Niggas male strippers when them poles bummin'

[Bridge: Trippie Redd & Lil Yachty]
Gang (uh), gang (uh), huh, gang (uh)

Ridin' 'round in a Maybach with my nigga Pellz
Glock out, running we empty 12
Bitch on my dick, that's a love spell (yeah)
Bitch with the shits, call her Annabelle (yeah)

Ten toes on my sole, niggas wouldn't double dare to cross the big Boat (yeah)
Last year

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 15: Tutweezy]

[Verse 16: Young M.A.]
Twenty racks in the back of jeans
Tatted sleeves, Patek freeze
Pretty nigga, that indeed
Thottie with me, black and cream
African, Japanese
I just call her blackanese
I'm just gonna tap that and leave
I don't leave the house unless I got a bag waitin' for me at the front door
If you short on my cash, thirty niggas hoppin' out a Uber truck
So don't try your luck, hoes down to fuck
Top floor of the hotel
Smokin' weed in the bathroom, put the shower on so it's no smell
Street cold, don't tell
But I'd rather live where it's no hell
It's funny how hatin' niggas be the ones who names ring no bells
Oh well, my bitch bad
And her pussy got a soap smell
She a model, nah she a model
She a little bougie
And I'm just tryna put this big wet tongue on top of that coochie
Earlier she a little mad at me, she a little moody
Sometimes I don't understand the bitch, she a little confusing
Like half the time I don't be even doin' shit, and she be assuming
Like I ain't loyal or somethin'
You act like I don't call you or somethin'
You act like you a little spoiled or somethin'
Is you hot like you boiling somethin'?
So all you rappers it's a rap for you like aluminum foil or somethin'
Better crown her, came from the ground up, from the soil or somethin'
Been 'bout it, every nigga with me poppin' like oil or somethin'
I was slackin', had to get on track like I'm recordin' or somethin'
I hear a lot of talk, but honestly they ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin'
And nowadays I don't trust a thing, so I ain't really sure about nothin'
I just fucked your bitch in Givenchy flip flops
And yeah we spendin' money, but we also spin blocks
Bend blocks, shout out my nigga Jezz, big opps
They ain't open up them doors, I had to pick locks
Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free the whole 9
Got lit on my own nigga, didn't need a cosign
It's Red Lyfe, no red lights, green lights go time
But before you get on the road, nigga make sure you know your road signs
He asked did I fuck his bitch, I said ""uh yeah nigga, four times""
My sex drive longer than my show lines, make her cum in no time
RL that's the bro sign, can't come in, we got closed sign
Can't hang here, this is not a clothesline
Fuck around and get clotheslined
No ghostwriter, I wrote mine
Wrote the whole rap and the whole rhyme
They like ""MA, where the album at?""
I just need a lil' more time
I got guns, but if I ain't usin' it, no need to show mine
Don't mean I won't blow, ma
Bitch nigga, you could blow, ma
In the club I drink out the bottle, ain't no need to even pour mine
Stripper bitches don't like me 'cause I get money and don't throw mine
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me, ain't gotta say it, you already know why
If I had a dick, you could suck it
If I had nuts, you could hold mine

[Refrain: Young M.A.]
I said, if I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Haha
If I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Fuck y'all niggas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 17: Bhad Bhabie]
Ayy
When I look around, don't see nobody in my lane
See these rappers need the clout, that's why they always say my name
I'm only gettin' better, bitter bitch it ain't gon' change
Why you tryna hang around me, bitch, get off 'cause you ain't gang
You ain't gang, treat you like a stain
All my biz is straight, I'd still be good without the fame
I got so many cousins, aunts, uncles that I never knew
On me for my revenue, I'm big now like I'm 7'2""
New whip and my leather smooth, try me, I'ma play it cool
Windows down, AC blowin', 20 below, I'm extra cool
You lookin' fed up 'cause of my bread up, I keep my head to the sky
Run up, [?] and I'm back to [?] where I'm droppin' the fire
Who want it? Tell me, bitches, who blunted?
You ain't know my crew run it? All we see is blue hundreds
On my dash, 200, these bitches sad and can't run it
Ho I'm a star, you wanna walkthrough you better tell me who fundin'

[Verse 18: Crank Lucas]

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 19: Chevy Woods & Wiz Khalifa]
Ay bitch, this a brand new chain
Put her in Vera Wang
She got a crazy top
I let her go insane
G-shit in my veins
Limited seats on my plane
Get to the country they know my name
I could pay for anything I'm ordering
Whether it's bitches, California weed, fourth down
Got 20 inches
I'm rolling up hella green by the pound
You wanna pinch this
Wondering what the stench is
Always played my position
We balling cause we the realest
...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 20: Roy Purdy]
Just make sure to always stay true to who you are"", and I did that
Jeans black with a pink hat
Sorry, I don't wanna come to ya kickback
Oh no, so cold like Frozone
9-2-0, what I rep, that's home
Big racks, big facts, no foolery
Got 'em like ""God damn, man, who is he?""
It's me, ya boy Roy so crispy
Really had to go and hit 'em with the quick speed
Too fast, look left, look right
You ain't gon' see nothin' like me in sight
Hit my dance real quick, ouu, I just might
Wanna sleep on me? Okay, good night
I'm gone, new song comin' soon
Ya boy Roy really been up in the stu'
It's nothin' new, yeah, this what I do
Been makin' music way before all the views
Whi-white T with the white vans
Oh man, god damn, I'm fresh
Kickin', laid back, life's good, no stress
I don't gotta flex, you know I'm up next
Sike, bitch, I'm up now
I'm holdin' it down
I'm feelin' great
I cannot frown
""Who Run It"" remix
Just something light
Had to snap real quick, now I'm droppin' the mic
Okay

[Verse 21: Slim Jesus]
Ayy, ayy, gang
Y'all know how the fuck I'm rockin' man
I'm hearin' a whole lot of talk about who run this shit
I be countin' stacks
Who run Ohio, that's me
Which one of y'all hotter than me?
Leave the beat like a hundred degrees
And it's still all this ice on me
Who getting plays like me?
Who getting paid like me?
Y'all was not made like me
And I put that on my G's
Remember they hated on me
I knew all I needed was cheese
Ran it up and I blew it on jeans
Had to run it back up times three
None of y'all wanna be like me
Run around with them pipes like me
Fresh pair of Off-Whites on my feet
Gold chain on a Polo white tee
In a trap with a whole lot of P's
Smoking dope 'til we Vietnamese
I threw bro lil thirty
He threw like fifty to me
All of these rappers is broke
That shit be sickening to me
You blew the whole bag on the road
You look like a victim to me
I just pulled up in a foreign
And you got a Honda on E
All black tints on all my whips
'Cause I know they're looking for me
Just know wherever I go
It's a glizzy with me right up under the seat
I give a fuck what you claiming you is
You can get touched with the heat
I remember being irrelevant
Now I get bands for all of my feats
Remember totin' tourists
Now we got AR's that's chopping down trees
It's a fifty on bro and a thirty on me
You don't really really want the beef
You can talk that shit on the internet
Run up, get done up, get wrapped up in sheets
They was talking crazy last night
'Til a hundred shots hit they block
I don't even know who got hit with that shit
But we smoking all opps
Everywhere I go I'm with the gang
It's at least three or four of them Glocks
If you speaking on who run it, ain't say my name, you smoking on rocks
I'm in the street like fuck 12, bitch I'm off the Henny
You can find me with the gang 'cause I don't fuck with many
Them my brothers, if I'm busting they gon' dump it with me
They know I'm a threat and that's the reason they ain't fucking with me, gang

Niggas goin down fast like stop drop

[Verse 23: TA Double Dolla]
They say I'm bougie and cocky

Threw a bag at my baby mama here you go, go shopping
Every other day I'm waking up to new money
Gettin deposits in
From negative to positive
Dollar boy just landed
In the city of angels
...

[Verse 24: Idontknowjeffery]
Point me out to who run it
Fuckin' man or a woman
I kick they ass in the stomach until they vomit from it
Nigga I'm sick I'm bubonic and you and that bitch is platonic
Stab your ass in the stomach and clean the mess up with Comet
Fuck all that extra shit
I'm in the bed with a naked bitch and her head just twist like damn exorcist
What ya tryna posses me with
The way she suck my dick was an accident cause I ain't even have to ask the bitch
Nigga I'm stingy as hell
I'm face my hoes nigga I don't even pass the bitch
And I shit on niggas on accident like I ate some laxatives
Try to impress me with that bullshit turn him to an acronym
Nigga its Prick Harper
I'm a shit starter
And all that bullshit you talkin' make my dick harder
I treat a rapper like his father I don't text him I don't call him
I don't bother
Nigga I let the Glock solve problems

[Verse 25: Xavier Wulf]
These rappers ain't runnin' shit but ya bitch
Who, where she at?
She at the crib tryna cook me something every damn day
Told her ""bitch I do it better"" by myself go move away
Here to stay
Up from now until whenever the fuck I say
...
Well I could I ain't never had a juug but I had a blunt to finish
You rap niggas still capping
...
Pulled up with a bitch so thick I'ma leave a little bit early just to hit
...
Serotonin too lit
I don't give a fuck 'bout you, him, them

[Chorus: DJ Paul]

[Verse 27: Jeremih]
Lil' mama give me head 'til I'm dead, I call it brainstormin'
You ain't even halfway 'Yonce, I could put a ring on it
Pop, country, rap, trap, punk, rock, I could still sing on it
On the block wit' niggas big as Shaq but I could still hang on it
3 story, no story, no Tory, this a different lane on 'em
Lane to lane, white ghost, red gust, that's a candy cane, homie
Everybody wanna be the king but who gon' make the claim for it
I'ma say me for the moment
[?]
So [?], I ain't scared or nothin'
Chicago made me a bear or somethin'
I just skydive, I'm so live, you could catch me comin' out the air or somethin'
Lost some niggas gettin' this money, still got a pocket full of dead homies
Got a bad bitch wit' a head on her
Versace robe, two bands for it
It's God's plan, I ain't playin' for it
I'm just tryna be the landlord
I came to fuck up the buildin'
Hitman, I'm gon' make a killin'
I'm used to shoppin' at Sears, now I be shoppin' wit Siri
Used to be stealin' cologne, now I be stealin' your bitches

[Bridge]
Yeah
Nah mean?
[?]
[?] slow it down, you know?
Go the other way on 'em

[Verse 28: Jeremih]
Yeah
Pull up to the Valley, car got no keys
Diamond pinky ring cost a low key
Make a play [?], you should proceed
Big ballin', put the money on the flo' seats
Bank account always doin' backflips
Used to have the walls and the matress
Numbers still the same since the old me
Don't get it fucked up, I ain't the old me
Who run it? Now who run it?
My pockets on cucumber
I'ma have yo' girl over
Have her speakin' boonomics
Got the Kevin Gates, I got that two phones, I got two numbers
Ain't talking YouTube numbers
I could take a few summers

[Verse 33: Dax]
Had to come here and enlighten
Had to come give you the facts, trapping is wack
You might get a stack
Your daughter at home, your mama still crying
Blacks in America dying
Trump in office, he wildin'
Droppin these bars for fun, we going to war
But look at the timing, buying
They put me in chains, confined me
I'm rapping the real but can't get a deal
These niggas is not replying
Why the system be falsifying?
They say that I might be crazy
They say that my shit too real
The reason that they cannot play me
Industry cannot detain me
A cross of Pac and Baby
I've been to hell and back, that's why they say they cannot save me
Ain't poppin' no pills, I stay in the field
These niggas is fakes, they mad that I'm real
I see that you broke, don't know how that feel
You gave up your life by signin' a deal
Might shout out to Kaep for taking a kneel
Might shout out to Jag for rappin the real
My bars is guns, they can't conceal
These niggas dumb
Not a rapper, I be in my own division
Save the world by 2020, nigga I be on a mission
I just started and I'm right exactly where I had envisioned
Niggas blind, that's why I rap, to clear their motherfucking vision
Fucking on the game
Fucking on you bitches who've been fucking for the fame
I've be getting rich and dodging niggas who ain't changed
Tried to tell my shooters, had to read [?] out the chain
With a bitty lil name, lil nigga you ain't gang
You not, circle small, like a dot
Keep it tight 'cause people like to come and try and make you fall
I've seen it all, it's fine
They'll try and stop your shine
They snakes, still smile up in your face but talk that shit behind, behind
I seen it all baby, watch out for these snakes in the grass
They sayin' just enough to your face to keep you happy
That way in case you do make it, they can say they been there
Ayy DJ cut the beat, cut the beat

[Bridge: Dax]
Hip hop is not dead and never left
It's just a book collectin' dust I found on the shelf
I don't care if you wanna read it or anybody else
'Cause I'll turn myself to Jesus and resurrect it myself

[Verse 34: 6ix9ine]
Yo, I usually don't do this
But you know what I'm saying
Had to come body bag this one time
Niggas really thought I was in jail or something
Momma didn't raise no hoe or something
I was really in the store bought a Snickers or something
I - I was trapping in the-in the way back and I got that
And I flip that and I really get that
But I told my mom ""I don't do that!""
But she was really there
And I told her that ""Yeah, I'm coming in,""
But she was like, ""Nah, don't come near""
And I was like, ""GED""
And I said, ""I flip that, really get that""
I whip that and I hit that and I-yeah
LA see you next week, Coachella I'm here today
But fuck that we here and we live wit' TR3YWAY
Fuck that umm
Cut it

[Verse 35: Futuristic]

[Verse 36: BlocBoy JB]
Pulled up with that stick, hey, nigga don't miss
Got your bitch, she on her knees, she gon' eat the dick

Thirty-four ounces of Barkley, Phoenix versus Knicks
Walk in this bitch with my stack out
Please don't run, I got the MAC out
This nigga just made me blackout
I'm 'bout to box him like Pacquiao (doon-doon-doon)
Kurt Angle, I'm making her tap out

Watch in your face, tell me how you gon' act now, bitch
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo
Riding with my motherfuckin' dogs, bruh
You ain't got no money, I can't call you
Put two up in your back, John Wall you
All this purple on me homie, I'm a baller
Crip, crip, crip, crip, crip, crip crip crip
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo (crip)

I got gold gold on my throat, diamonds in my teeth (ice)
Clarity, clarity, clarity, clarity, all this ice on me (ice)
Got this bad bitch with blonde hair, I call her Russian Cream
And I got that baby chopper, I'll rock your ass to sleep
Can't stand me, take a seat (ho), designer head to feet, yeah
Everything on fleek, Cartier on me, yeah
I dress like a geek, yeah, boy your swag is weak, yeah
That shit is so cheap, yeah, my shit overseas, yeah
I'm fly like a butterfly and I sting like a bee, yeah
Call me Glock Ali, yeah, diamonds fighting like Tina
Turner, bitch I turn up, Royal Rumble
Thirty niggas with me and you know they ready to burn you
Knuck if you buck, run up and you get done up
No I'm not from Louisville, but bitch I keep my slugger
Straight up out the jungle, ain't no talk or tussle
Got no time to scuffle, I'm 'bout my chips like Ruffles
Workin like a butler, ain't no more struggle
Tell these niggas catch up, tennis chains mustard
Ran up my racks, run and tell that
Ran through a bag and got that shit right back
These niggas ain't doing shit, these niggas ain't talkin' jack
You niggas ain't running shit, this chopper make you run a lap
Yeah
Glizzock

[Verse 38: Ballout]
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
I'm in a truck called SRT or somethin'
Doin' Need for Speed or somethin'
Hundred thousand my key or somethin'
Two hundred my Jeep or somethin'
Niggas broke as hell actin' like they don't know how to eat or somethin'
Miami Beach Louis sandals, know I got my heat or somethin'
At the condo, you can't get in unless you got a key or somethin'
Smokin' out the 440 and it smoke a P or somethin'
Took the doors off, ridin' through Cali in my Jeep stuntin'
Long as they print money it's gon' keep comin'
I know you hear my Jeep runnin'
I ain't pumpin' gas, they gon' keep pumpin'
Ride through the hood and they keep honkin'
People look at me and they see money
I'm a boss, d-money
Load em' people up, my phone gon' keep jumpin'
They like ""Ball, is it weed or is it d-money?""
Bankroll like street money
Walk in Neiman's, leave the Hellcat and the Jeep runnin

[Verse 39: Chief Keef]
My bitch said she gon' leave me like she complete somethin'
Bitch, you [?] met you at 2:30 and fucked your ass at 3 somethin'
Who you run up on? Not us
I'ma take my own heat, shoot three or somethin'
Might be in the trap, call Jeep or somethin'
Might get Ball with a whole P or somethin'
Might be in SRT or somethin'
Krispy might make a bitch cream or somethin'
Cross that red line, get a beam or somethin'
Wake you up like you had a bad dream or somethin'
Who, Chief Sosa think he Rambo?
I was in the field with the lizard
Doing spinouts since the blizzard
Like Snoop Dogg ""What's the wiz-zard?""
Disappear on that bitch like a wizard
And I'm cuttin' real sharp like a scissor
Roll by so fast, Big Dipper
I'm in LA more than a Clipper
Balenciaga more than a owner
Bitch, we out here more than a corner
Smoke way more dope than a stoner
And I drink way more than Homer
I can see like Christopher Columbus
Juiceman, the trap house bunkin'
You niggas ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
King Sosa don't care about nothin'
F on my shirt, on my feet double Gs
Start gettin' F's in sixth grade, couldn't even get a couple B's
All for my habit, whats the fee? A couple G's
Aye lil' bitch, these Moncler, no need to buckle these
Aye lil' baby, these not me, no need to upload these
And when you hear that [?], bitch that's me up your street
And just make you think about when they put that thing up your teeth
Lil' nigga said up yo chest talkin' to me, up your speech

[Verse 40: Chief Keef & Ballout]
Pullin' off from Neiman's doin' donuts in the Jeep
Track [?] Look like Black Hawk flying out the street
Hopped out for twenty minutes for a backend
Seen your girlfriends tryna get back in
Hopped in the Hellcat, had to put the track in
Ball, you got the blues, why the fuck you blackin'?
Ball, you can rap, why you steady trappin'?
'Cause I get it for the L-O like Shawty nigga, tap in
Sosa, why you pay a thousand for that headband?
Because Ben Franklin is a dead man
Any time you see me, wonder that's that bread man
If he step in front his gun, then that's a brave man

[Chorus: DJ Paul]

Pink and purple in my cup, I'm Lil Pump-in'
Trap jumpin' (like what, like what?)
Like some fingers, it's thumpin'
Who done it?
Pockets fat with bricks of hundreds, I'm Klump-in' (Sherman)
I run it
Headed to the top, like quickies I'm comin' (ugh ugh)
Bagg
Talkin' 'bout quickies, I'm comin'
Ugh ugh, yeah
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em
Get hit for lookin' suspicious (watch how you look)
Diamonds wet, they gon' wash the dishes
Sittin' in the coupe with the missus, Whitney
If you bad you can fuck her with me
I'm taking chances, risks (risks)
Learn how to dance, my wrist did (Breezy)
I'm like the Memphis Kendrick (Lamar)
I was broke, now I""m a rich kid (look at my shoes, watch me plug walk)
This new freezer cost right here sixty (sixty K, shout out to Icebox)
AP ring and watch Jordan Pippen (duo)
And you know I run this shit, pockets keep me limpin'
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em, yeah

[Verse 42: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa
I get trippy like three six
I just hit a bad bitch with my new bitch
I don't do Kel-Tec, FN can't miss
Souped up box Chevy came with a kill switch (kill out)
I stack bread, mister winners (stack it)
I drive a tank in the winter (kill 'em)
No L's, nigga I'm a winner
This year is not for beginners
These pair of [?] call 'em Sprinters
Seventy K for a new straight A
I'm havin' shooters, no mayday
Every day to me is more money Monday
And my neck is cold like I ate a sundae
Get up, stack the money, never switch up
A hundred for the Patty, know I stay lit up
I'm pushin' for greatness but I don't do sit-ups
And I love a bitch that can get my dick up
I been quiet but I can really start a riot
You can get it grilled or fried
Your favorite rapper be cappin' with lies
I call it burnt out and tied, therefore we don't have ties
Water on me, submarine
Break the pot, I cook up clean
What's the blue strip without greens
When it comes [?] I'm the king
I say I'm too blunt, I'm not mean
Good game from an old head, call him Sega
Ice talk crazy on the Razr
I keep it player, new crib got layers
It ain't 'bout paper, I'll talk to you later
I give you pimpin', but I stay drippin'
You small like a wiz then I ball like I'm Pippen
You be slippin', they call you Tristan
You tell the tea so I named you Lipton
Hundred bows, kicked a hundred doors
They cash me out then I bring a hundred more
New Rari came with Lambo doors
House in Berlin came with three stoves
She ride the dick, no Rodeo Drive
Hit you with a combo, you get two sides
Black excellence, I'm excellent
I bought the block back for the Nobel Prize
Pink slip shawty right now 'cause I'm on
You pop big shit now then it's on
Think smart, first get a call then a home
You don't need a loan, get a zone, get it gone
I'm on my ten flip now, get your own
AP two-tone freeze, honeycomb
I'm lightskinned, call me Kev Combs
And I get money, badda-bing badda-bom
I could count a whole hundred in your face
I got air, fuck a pair of human race
Walk in safe, look like a Chase
Dipped out my safe and it turned to a chase
You tryna be me, I bet you gon' fail
Big checks comin', now I check the mail
I'm thinkin' money, blue or green hundreds
House in the hills, it look like a whale's (whoa)
I could say somethin' but it ain't the time
It ain't on me if ain't mine, eliminate me with a lime
I got heart of a lion, if I said they ain't bitin' I'd be lyin'
Lowkey in a low-rider, I write mines, no ghostwriter
I be leanin' and lookin' for the new Spider
I'm on fire and my chains firefighter (Flippa)

[Verse 43: Cdot Honcho]
I paid a G for my sneakers bitch
These ain’t no regular Adidas, hah
Have fo'nem parked outside your shit
Like your shit an arena
I’m up on Hollywood Boulevard
Fo'nem with me, not a bodyguard
Try it, you know they be choppin' shit
Might turn this bitch to a lumberyard
I was the first one in SRT
And I drove that bitch like a bumper car
I got your bitch up on DVD
Ain’t got a heart, need another heart
Roc, he'll circle around your block
On point like he really can’t find a park
Pop out you only gon' see a spark
Police said they only seen a dart
I got ten K in my joggers, ayy
You don’t want problems
Five on your head, niggas gon' pop out your closet
Smokin' biscotti, too much gelato
Feel like I’m sitting on a rocket
Ain’t no more space in my pockets
Ain’t no more space in my closet either
I just be thinking 'bout profit
I'm in the coupe with a mamacita
She only good for the noggin
That bitch know she got a mouth on her
She eat me up then I’m out on her
No we don’t play with the police games
She know we put a route on her
Look I ain't shit, with another one
Nothing was given l ran it up, bitch

[Verse 44: Sauce Walka]
If I really want his body I'ma sleep in the grass
If I get my hands dirty I'ma wash 'em in gas
Get that gunpowder off me, roll a wood up, and laugh
'cause I'm really 'bout that murder, I'll smoke your ass
Pay a bitch to wrap you with a cord and choke your ass nigga
Yeah I could get on some evil shit
Rip out your heart like a demon shit
Send body parts to your people shit
Yeah I send your hands to your mama
I send your legs to your daddy
I send your eyes to your granny
I send your foot to your daughter
Fuck it, the label some horror
Fuck it, the label some saw
Granny playin' guitar, 'cause you ain't never ever comin' back no more
I got guns when it comes to the store
I got guns that you niggas can't order
I got guns that you never can borrow
I got guns that can still shoot good underwater
I got guns that can shoot through brick walls, I got guns that got night vision
I got guns that shoot hand grenades, I got handguns that hold fifty
I got guns with long barrels on 'em, look so ugly, shoot so pretty
I got guns in my bitch titties, moral is don't fuck with me
If it's an issue we see him 'bout it, if it's an issue we be about it
It ain't a question if we about it, it ain't a question if we about it
Master P, yeah I'm 'bout it 'bout it
'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it
Ran up him with a shotty, ran up on him with a shotgun
Make him jump like a pop gun, let both kids play with pop guns
Like a needle I'ma pop somethin', like a football I'ma drop somethin'
Ooh-wee
Who done it? who done it?
Who done it? who done it? nigga
The kid done did, one and done nigga
Sorry for the Sauce 3
Who done it? who done it? me

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I lied (hah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat
I'm not the same, man, and I could let you check the tag now
I'm rockin' name brand, I'm only chasin' after bags now
I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride
Nigga, this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied
I ain't got no fucking job, this my life, this my, wait—

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
All of y'all wishy and washy
All y'all my kids in a car seat
I take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi
Lyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands, I think I need to find you a hobby
God got a plan, hope that God hold your hand, I think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!
Tell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit and I'm coming back to get even
I went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region, I let off this mac for no reason
You are now witnessing greatness, I'm practically preaching and this is the passion of Jesus
And all you basic motherfuckas are lacking achievement, and I've just been laughing and geekin'
Back to business, I got mad intentions, I ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions
But it's competition, I'm a savage winning
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician
I don't see you niggas, I've been lacking vision
You've been acting different, I've been acting distant
I'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention
You gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!
This is uncomfortable, you just keep putting your feet in a fire
I think my gun got a crush on you, boy, you 'bout to meet your secret admirer
How you do shit you don't wanna do? I do that shit just to keep me inspired
I used to hit it and leave when I wanted to, now I hit it and be sleepin' inside her, woo
Roll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em, put that motherfucking smoke up on 'em with that holy water
Joyner Lucas, I'm a holy mona leader motor runnin'
Man, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it
Prayed about it to the Lord about it in the morning, but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out
I ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down
Don't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)

[Verse 3: Rocky Badd]
Ayy, ayy
Look who I'm around man
A couple people switched, that's why you don't see 'em round man
Four four down man, know that that's a man down
I make bitches stand down then make them put they heads down
Only time you sendin' shots is when you sneak dissin'
Only time I'm on the block is when the bitches send chicken
I ain't trippin' on that nigga, he don't call unless it's business
I ain't trippin' on these bitches, once they eat they in they feelings
I ain't trippin' on no rapper that can't fight but in my business
Get to trippin' on that rapper, if she start I gotta finish
And if you fuck your niggas you can't call them boys your killers
'Cause they playin' with your feelings, mines ain't playin' with these niggas, haha
And I got shit they want but the shit they cannot buy
Bitches brazy on they Live but they barely go outside
I seen pussy in they eyes, I said fuck it, let' em slide
Told 'em I won't text these bitches, I just ho 'em, but I lied
I don't know why bitches tryin' while they funds lookin' tied
I can't trip because they lyin', let 'em take it up with God
These bitches plan winning, we gon' see how hard they grind
'Cause I push these bitches back every time I spit a line, haha

If I asked you to be mine one last time
Before you're truly gone

Yeah I would like to hold you
Let our minds connect
I promise it could be true
Baby we’re a mess
So I'm just feeling so good
Nobody can do it like you
Give me that feeling give me that radio love

If I lit a thousand lights to ease your mind
Would it feel like home
If I really took the time to say you're right
And I’ve got it wrong

Baby I'm so sick of fighting
You hypnotize me
I don't want to lose it
You can travel the world go to the moon
Still I'll follow

I want it I need it
A feeling you give me
So sing it throw me back
Give me that feeling give me that radio love

I'd rather give you all my time
And I'm okay if the script isn't written
I'm alright if the road isn't clear
Until we can see into the future
I'm taking my chances right here

[Chorus]
Who am I if I'm stranded without you?
Who am I if I can't be around you?
Who am I if I don't have you, then who the hell am I?
Who am I from the spring to the summer?
Who am I in the middle of winter?
Who am I if I don't have you, then who the hell am I?

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
So I don't care if our plans never happen
If we always get lost out at sea
I can live with the pain, the shame, the blame
If I know you'll be next to me
There's a whole lot of darkness before us
And a whole lot of life left behind
Though I don't let it get in between us
Whatever we've lost we can find

[Chorus]
Who am I if I'm stranded without you?
Who am I if I can't be around you?
Who am I if I don't have you, then who the hell am I?
Who am I from the spring to the summer?
Who am I in the middle of winter?
Who am I if I don't have you, then who the hell am I?

Want you to stay these satin sheets

So why-y-y?

Everything just felt so damn right
We were closer than the best of friends
But the seasons changed, you changed your game
Ain't got a thing for our fling now
All good things come to an end

Cannot repair the damages
Yeah, they'll heal in time
And I will be all right
Possibly we will meet
Each other again and you will see
You should stay with me

You gotta, you gotta grow older
Get rid of pornography posters
Clean up yourself and become sober
You keep calling me, baby
When you should treat me like a lady
But you just keep driving me crazy
Go play all your video games and
Come back when you are lonely
Come back when you are lonely

Now, I saw your text the other day
Sayin’ that you really miss me
I don't know if I should text you back
Just when I'm about to hit, ""Respond""

I'll make you feel special
Kiss you so you won't forget
That my only obsession is you, you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
The heat is on, we're all alone
I'll be yours 'til break of dawn
So, baby, tonight let's run all the red lights
The heat is on, we're breathing slow
I'll take you where you wanna go
No limits tonight

[Chorus]
I'm making moves like I love ya (Love ya)
Yeah, I'm wearing blue like I love ya (Love ya)
I know what you're craving for
So what are you waiting for?
Baby, I'm on you like I love ya (Love ya)
Like I love ya

I'll kiss you the way that you want it
Touch you the way that you like it
Ah-ay, ah-ay, ah-ah-ay
I'll kiss you the way that you want it
Touch you the way that you like it
Ah-ay, ah-ay, ah-ah-ay
I'll kiss you the way that you want it

So, let me be (get me)
I'm just tryna be me
I'm just tryna be me

Watch me rock, watch me vibe

[Verse 1: Tinchy Stryder]
Me, I'm fresh to death
Adidas line me up like I'm putting in work
They're giving me straps on the regs
I still wear the green stripes with the creps
Wrist ain't got no Ro to the Lex
I roll in the Lexus, I'm streetwise
I can never look cool in Levis
I'd rather put white gold in my necklace
No limit with the flows, I'm reckless
With my Ps, it's all BBCs and Armani
I'm skulled out, coming like Ed Hardy, don't start me
I'm smelling like a million pounds, I'm straight killing
Ladies love me dressed in white linen
Yeah, I'm a breath of fresh air
Ruff Sqwad, we stay flee to death here

[Verse 2: Rapid]
I'm so amazing, I got eyelids raising
48 hours in the lab I'm craving
Breaking my sleep cycle, I been slaving
I chose the path I didn't wanna go, Cambridge or Havering
Good results, I got an A in
Physical Education, I wasn't taking
No prisoners on the track when racing
Hood star, pick up the speed and start pacing away
It's a new day and I'm still here, still fear
Not going through the door, still here
Snakes rattling in my ear, so so near
You can't match my flow, I'm so so clear
With me what you see is what you get, straight up
You're living in an illusion, please wake up
I'm a cash cash money money maker
Then I murk the track, uh huh, later

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fuda Guy]
Yo, see me, see me, I really am a problem
In the Ruff Sqwad camp I'm known as a wrong'un
I realise you man are soft like cotton
You see my squad are rough like Compton
And we talk flee girls and we got them
Flee to the T, we got the swagger on lock and
Don't mention the word if you're not and
Keep sayin' ""Flee"" and we're gonna have a problem
With you, you and the rest of your crew
We're fully grown in this, you man are still youts
That's why I don't drink whiskey, I drink Goose
Big man ting, I don't know about you
Long, but champagne, we pop it
I'm a drunken animal, I really gotta stop it
But honest, that's how I am, see
So really I'm just tryna be me

[Verse 4: Slix]
(I'm just tryna be me) So I stay flee
Red and green from my neck to my feet
Got that due flow, I could never rhyme loosely
So tight and the swag's so complete
And I admit, it's hard being me
I make money everyday, go check, I'm guaranteed
VIP guestlist, no need for ID
Champagne rosé, girls around me
And even if I had one leg left
I'd still run up a bill in West End's best
Stay fresh, get more forget less
Crazy for paper spend, senseless
And I'm like a breath for the freshness
And you smell the essence
Keep my love locked down like K West's
Flee recognise flee, do you get the message?

Si la femme, c'est l'effet, le flirt, c'est l'effort
Donc j'effleure ses effets et effeuille cette flore
Ce soir, c'est les faits, le feu dans nos corps
J'lui ferais vivre mille méfaits et ferais vibrer ses cordes

[Refrain : RNK]

J'sens qu'y a l'feeling (hum)
Pas besoin briefing (ohooo)
Car j'sens qu'y à l'feeling (huum)
Soir-ce, on s'affilie (ohoooo)

[Couplet 1 : RNK]

J'veux t'voir qué-cro l'oreiller de rouge te colorier
J'vais t'faire perdre tes calories suis la cadence, on s'cale un rythme
Nos corps seront comme endiablée
Nos codes seront comme enclavée
Mais de tous, ça, on s'en colle comme ton fard sur mon duvet
J'laisserais pas d'trace dans l'histoire, mais sur ton postérieur
J'serai peut-être lâche, l'histoire d'un soir
Mais serrement ta meilleure
Car j'te ferais réviser tes math avec le nombre position
Les langues et ton anat', car j'sais qu't'es en période d'revision
T'façon pas besoin d'contexte pour l'sexe qu'importe le textile
Ta des complexes, décompresse ce soir on s'exil
J'ai du latex si tu stresse et j'te dirait qu'tes sexy
Si t'es romantique, j'mettrais de  l'encens et d'la musique
Juste pour tes beaux cils
J'ferais qu'l'ambiance soit cosy
Mais n'oublie pas qu'si j'négocie
C'est juste pour avoir ton pussy
Donc m'prend la tête si j'me barre le lendemain
Car j'veux pas toi mistinguette j'veux juste que tu m'donne un coup d'main

[Couplet 2 : SLV]

Première rencontre un peu furtive, car j’étais pas prêt
J'relève la tête mon corps vacille, faut pas que j'tombe par terre
Elle passe en coup d'vent comme une ombre
Peu de temps pour l'apercevoir suspense à son comble
Première vision un boule tout rond et des jolies cheveux blond
Envie d'l'aborder, mais cet instant ne sera pas plus long
J'ai comme un flash j'crois qu'y a pas d'hésitation
Ouais, j'pense avec qu'avec ma verge, donc imagine l'inspiration
Son boule est à croquer pour elle j'irais payer toutes les ardoises
Son regard m'est inconnu, j'aimerais qu'il soit couleur topaze
J'passe devant elle, j'ai succombé, j'veux voir son visage
Deux jolies yeux saphir, une bouche pulpeuse, un magnifique lissage
Besoin d’être accompagné s'il le faut, je serais à ses pieds
Ouais, s'il le faut, j'serais à ses pieds !
Cette nuit, j'ai rencontré une femme de rêve
J'voulais goûter à ses lèvres, mais elle à fini dans mon pieu !

[Pont : RNK & SLV]

Whooo j'sens qu'y a l'feeling !

Avec elle, j'suis toujours dans l'cou
Comme un suçon
Mon objectif est clair, j'avance dans flou
J'ai des visions
De son boule en 4k pour la montée faut plus qu'un 4X4
Donc j'aimerais l'a voir à 4 pattes

(whoooo ahah)
Car j'sens qu'entre elle et moi y'a l'feeling
Ouais bébé ! yeah, yeah, ça fait ! (ouais ouais)

[Refrain : RNK]

J'sens qu'y a l'feeling (hum)
Pas besoin briefing (ohooo)
Car j'sens qu'y à l'feeling (huum)

Just let me love you when your heart is tired

When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don’t talk
And if they could, they’d say
Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

You and me it felt so right
Burned my feelings
Was it love or fake delight?

That ""we"" disappear tomorrow
I'm waiting here alone as
I watch my reflection in the bottle

You write ""all right?""
But always too late
Hold on, hold tight
Gotta stand up straight

And now I'm out here on my own
Waiting for someone new
Waiting for someone, someone

Tous les soirs, j’m’endors en repensant à sa voix
Elle est sage et j’sais que j’peux trust son inside

De mon cœur, j’veux lui donner l’intime sans finir sad

Reste avec moi, que j’te listen toute la night
Hugs toute la night
J’veux faire des hugs toute la night

Verse 1
T’es l’premier visage auquel j’pense la journée, dès lе matin au réveil
J’sais qu’elle еst pas bien tant qu’elle n’a pas de signe de vie, qu’elle a pas d’mes nouvelles

Elle veut mes yeux pour voir nos lendemains
Et nos deux mains afin d’sentir notre avenir naissant
Et ma voix pour l’entendre dire que c’est la dernière
Bébé j’suis à terre c’est bon

J’ai les butterflies et j’fais un all-in sur toi
Écoute ton cœur ça sera phénoménal
À nous deux, notre seule limite sera le ciel

C’est une histoire en deux temps, un regard et j’cesse de répondre
Et l’histoire de nos deux mains, qui s’baladeront sans concessions

Bébé tu sais que je t’aime, et je sais que toi aussi
C’est la seule dans ma vie maintenant, je n’ai d’yeux que pour elle
Pas d’hésitation si demain je dois mourir pour elle
Y a que pour toi que j’le ferais si ce n’est pas pour ma mère

Reste avec moi, que j’te listen toute la night
Hugs toute la night
J’veux faire des hugs toute la night


Verse 2
Bébé chérie t’es comme mon Kinder surprise, chez toi y a rien à jeter
J’veux déguster ton chocolat et ton lait, et m’amuser avec le jouet

Par contre avec ton cœur, je ne veux pas jouer
C’est ton père et ta mère que je veux rencontrer
Avoir une bonne raison de mettre un costard l’été
Transpirer à mort sans me sentir gêné

Même dans la Rue Sainte-Catherine blindée l’été, j’n’ai d’yeux que pour toi
Mon cœur bat plus vite quand j’entends le son de ta voix
J’espère ne plus me tromper, ne plus toucher de bois
T’es le genre de déesse qu’on retrouve pas chez Citroën
Si j’suis avec toi toute l’année, y a plus de saisons car t’es mon soleil

Avec toi je vis à 130 continuellement, c’est comme si j’étais sur l’A10
Ma chérie je n’ai d’yeux que pour toi
J’veux que tu saches à quel point mon coeur bat que pour toi
J’suis trop kawaïné mais je n’ai d’yeux que pour toi

Tous les soirs, j’m’endors en repensant à sa voix
Elle est sage et j’sais que j’peux trust son inside

259,22436,Totem,Sex Room,"I have adopted the term ‘Omnipotence of Thought’ from a highly intelligent man, a former sufferer from compulsion neurosis, who, after being cured through psychoanalytic treatment, was able to demonstrate his efficiency and good sense[113]. He had coined this phrase to designate all those peculiar and uncanny occurrences which seemed to pursue him just as they pursue others afflicted with his malady. Thus if he happened to think of a person, he was actually confronted with this person as if he had conjured him up; if he inquired suddenly about the state of health of an acquaintance whom he had long missed he was sure to hear that this acquaintance had just died, so that he could believe that the deceased had drawn his attention to himself by telepathic means; if he uttered a half meant imprecation against a stranger, he could expect to have him die soon thereafter and burden him with the responsibility for his death. He was able to explain most of these cases in the course of the treatment, he could tell how the illusion had originated, and what he himself had contributed towards furthering his superstitious expectations[114]. All compulsion neurotics are superstitious in this manner and often against their better judgment.

The existence of omnipotence of thought is most clearly seen in compulsion neurosis, where the results of this primitive method of thought are most often found or met in consciousness. But we must guard against seeing in this a distinguishing characteristic of this neurosis, for analytic investigation reveals the same mechanism in the other neuroses. In every one of the neuroses it is not the reality of the experience but the reality of the thought which forms the basis for the symptom formation. Neurotics live in a special world in which, as I have elsewhere expressed it, only the ‘neurotic standard of currency’ counts, that is to say, only things intensively thought of or affectively conceived are effective with them, regardless of whether these things are in harmony with outer reality. The hysteric repeats in his attacks and fixates through his symptoms, occurrences which have taken place only in his phantasy, though in the last analysis they go back to real events or have been built up from them. The neurotic’s guilty conscience is just as incomprehensible if traced to real misdeeds. A compulsion neurotic may be oppressed by a sense of guilt which is appropriate to a wholesale murderer, while at the same time he acts towards his fellow beings in a most considerate and scrupulous manner, a behaviour which he evinced since his childhood. And yet his sense of guilt is justified; it is based upon intensive and frequent death wishes which unconsciously manifest themselves towards his fellow beings. It is motivated from the point of view of unconscious thoughts, but not of intentional acts. Thus the omnipotence of thought, the over-estimation of psychic processes as opposed to reality, proves to be of unlimited effect in the neurotic’s affective life and in all that emanates from it. But if we subject him to psychoanalytic treatment, which makes his unconscious thoughts conscious to him he refuses to believe that thoughts are free and is always afraid to express evil wishes lest they be fulfilled in consequence of his utterance. But through this attitude as well as through the superstition which plays an active part in his life he reveals to us how close he stands to the savage who believes he can change the outer world by a mere thought of his.

The primary obsessive actions of these neurotics are really altogether of a magical nature. If not magic they are at least anti-magic and are destined to ward off the expectation of evil with which the neurosis is wont to begin. Whenever I was able to pierce these secrets it turned out that the content of this expectation of evil was death. According to Schopenhauer the problem of death stands at the beginning of every philosophy; we have heard that the formation of the soul conception and of the belief in demons which characterize animism, are also traced back to the impression which death makes upon man. It is hard to decide whether these first compulsive and protective actions follow the principle of similarity, or of contrast, for under the conditions of the neurosis they are usually distorted through displacement upon some trifle, upon some action which in itself is quite insignificant[115]. The protective formulæ of the compulsion neurosis also have a counterpart in the incantations of magic. But the evolution of compulsive actions may be described by pointing out how these actions begin as a spell against evil wishes which are very remote from anything sexual, only to end up as a substitute for forbidden sexual activity, which they imitate as faithfully as possible.

If we accept the evolution of man’s conceptions of the universe mentioned above, according to which the animistic phase is succeeded by the religious, and this in turn by the scientific, we have no difficulty in following the fortunes of the ‘omnipotence of thought’ through all these phases. In the animistic stage man ascribes omnipotence to himself; in the religious he has ceded it to the gods, but without seriously giving it up, for he reserves to himself the right to control the gods by influencing them in some way or other in the interest of his wishes. In the scientific attitude towards life there is no longer any room for man’s omnipotence; he has acknowledged his smallness and has submitted to death as to all other natural necessities in a spirit of resignation. Nevertheless, in our reliance upon the power of the human spirit which copes with the laws of reality, there still lives on a fragment of this primitive belief in the omnipotence of thought.

In retracing the development of libidinous impulses in the individual from its mature form back to its first beginnings in childhood, we at first found an important distinction which is stated in the Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex[116]. The manifestations of sexual impulses can be recognized from the beginning, but at first they are not yet directed to any outer object. Each individual component of the sexual impulse works for a gain in pleasure and finds its gratification in its own body. This stage is called autoerotism and is distinguished from the stage of object selection.

In the course of further study it proved to be practical and really necessary to insert a third stage between these two or, if one prefers, to divide the first stage of autoerotism into two. In this intermediary stage, the importance of which increases the more we investigate it, the sexual impulses which formerly were separate, have already formed into a unit and have also found an object; but this object is not external and foreign to the individual, but is his own ego, which is formed at this period. This new stage is called narcism, in view of the pathological fixation of this condition which may be observed later on. The individual acts as if he were in love with himself; for the purposes of our analysis the ego impulses and the libidinous wishes cannot yet be separated from each other.

Although this narcistic stage, in which the hitherto dissociated sexual impulses combine into a unity and take the ego as their object, cannot as yet be sharply differentiated, we can already surmise that the narcistic organization is never altogether given up again. To a certain extent man remains narcistic, even after he had found outer subjects for his libido, and the objects on which he bestows it represent, as it were, emanations of the libido which remain with his ego and which can be withdrawn into it. The state of being in love, so remarkable psychologically, and the normal prototype of the psychoses, corresponds to the highest stage of these emanations, in contrast to the state of self-love.

This high estimation of psychic acts found among primitives and neurotics, which we feel to be an overestimation, may now appropriately be brought into relation to narcism, and interpreted as an essential part of it. We would say that among primitive people thinking is still highly sexualized and that this accounts for the belief in the omnipotence of thought, the unshaken confidence in the capacity to dominate the world and the inaccessibility to the obvious facts which could enlighten man as to his real place in the world. In the case of neurotics a considerable part of this primitive attitude had remained as a constitutional factor, while on the other hand the sexual repression occurring in them has brought about a new sexualization of the processes of thought. In both cases, whether we deal with an original libidinous investment of thought or whether the same process has been accomplished regressively, the psychic results are the same, namely, intellectual narcism and omnipotence of thought[117].

If we may take the now established omnipotence of thought among primitive races as a proof of their narcism, we may venture to compare the various evolutionary stages of man’s conception of the universe with the stages of the libidinous evolution of the individual. We find that the animistic phase corresponds in time as well as in content with narcism, the religious phase corresponds to that stage of object finding which is characterized by dependence on the parents, while the scientific stage has its full counterpart in the individual’s stage of maturity where, having renounced the pleasure principle and having adapted himself to reality, he seeks his object in the outer world[118].

Only in one field has the omnipotence of thought been retained in our own civilization, namely in art. In art alone it still happens that man, consumed by his wishes, produces something similar to the gratification of these wishes, and this playing, thanks to artistic illusion, calls forth effects as if it were something real. We rightly speak of the magic of art and compare the artist with a magician. But this comparison is perhaps more important than it claims to be. Art, which certainly did not begin as art for art’s sake, originally served tendencies which to-day have for the greater part ceased to exist. Among these we may suspect various magic intentions[119].


Footnotes:

[113] Remarks upon a case of Compulsion Neurosis, Jahrb. für Psychoanalyt. und Psychopath. Forschungen, Vol. I, 1909.

[114] We seem to attribute the character of the ‘uncanny’ to all such impressions which seek to confirm the omnipotence of thought and the animistic method of thought in general, though our judgment has long rejected it.

[115] The following discussions will yield a further motive for this displacement upon a trivial action.

[116] Monograph Series, 1916.

[117] It is almost an axiom with writers on this subject that a sort of ‘Solipsism or Berkleianism’ (as Professor Sully terms it as he finds it in the child) operates in the savage to make him refuse to recognize death as a fact.—Marett, Pre-animistic Religion, Folklore, Vol. XI, 1900, p. 178.

[118] We merely wish to indicate here that the original narcism of the child is decisive for the interpretation of its character development and that it precludes the assumption of a primitive feeling of inferiority for the child.

[119] S. Reinach, L’Art et la Magie, in the collection Cultes, Mythes et Religions, Vol. I, pp. 125-136. Reinach thinks that the primitive artists who have left us the scratched or painted animal pictures in the caves of France did not want to ‘arouse’ pleasure, but to ‘conjure things’. He explains this by showing that these drawings are in the darkest and most inaccessible part of the caves and that representations of feared beasts of prey are absent. “Les modernes parlent souvent, par hyperbole, de la magie du pinceau ou du ciseau d’un grand artiste et, en général, de la magie de l’art. Entendu en sense propre, qui est celui d’une constrainte mystique exercée par la volonté de l’homme sur d’autres volontés ou sur les choses, cette expression n’est plus admissible; mais nous avons vu qu’elle était autrefois rigouresement, vraie, du moins dans l’opinion des artistes” (p. 136).

Flashback to the time in your life
When you thought it would be easy
But it's hard when you're take on the world alone
The one shot that you fire at the sky
Hoping someone else can see it
Just a sign that you're not out there on your own

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin & Michel Zitron]
We come one tonight
I've been waiting for your wake up call
Growing stronger now
I can hear it in a thunderstorm

[Chorus: John Martin, with Michel Zitron]
We sing, oh oh oh oh oh
I don't want to do this without you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you

[Verse 2: John Martin]
Some say you can never go back
To the city built for dreamers
But I know we can find it on our own
The one shot that we fire at the sky
But this time we are together
Right here in this moment where we belong

We come one tonight

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

You set my heart on fire

And lately, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again

Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing

What I got to do to show you
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you

And it's barely enough to pay the rent
Yeah he's been diving in the deep end
Ever since she walked away

There's only one thing keeping him together
It's those two days every month
Oh yeah it makes him feel a little better
When he gets to see his son

Go to sleep now, go to sleep now my child
I promise i will keep you safe from harm
Go to sleep now, go to sleep now my child
Yeah you will always be my number one

Go to sleep now go to sleep now

He's got nobody left to turn to
Every night he sleeps alone (yeah)
And all his friends are gone
When she left they went along
It's tearing up his soul

There's only one thing keeping him together
Yeah its the chance to be someone
Oh it makes him feel a little better

Go to sleep now, go to sleep now my child

Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

Why we keep coming back for more

Don't hang up
I wanna talk a little more before I go

I close my eyes, knowin' it'll be alright (Knowin' it'll be alright)

They can't hold my hand, no

Oh, it's much much more

Would mean, so much
What a difference
And we walk hand in hand
I feel, so real

If you need a hand to bare the weight

I could never kiss you only

We could never live completely

Something's going down tonight

Save me from the life I know
Will you follow me only for the night, don't go

If I go now

Will you follow me?
Save me from the life I know
Will you follow me?
Only for the night, don't go

Hold on let me wrap you up
Let you breathe you in, ooh
Cause oh when the sun comes out we'll be gone again, ooh
Tonight we could say its love, we could just pretend, ooh

Cause oh when the sun comes out we'll be gone, will we love? will we love?
Will you follow me?
Save me from the life i've known
Will you follow me?

Only for the night i'll go, ooh

No luck, no fucks, tough love, half blood
Stripped down, beat down, blacked-out, choking
No sound, no crowd, burnt up, broken

Cause reality is a cancer and we've discovered the cure
They took your money and your freedom and your time
They almost took it all but they'll never take your mind!

Jack the mack, Jack the mack
Jack the mack, Jack the mack
Jack the mack, Jack the mack

[Verse 1]
Skins go ooh over Jack the mack
J-A-C-K M-A-C-K (?) that is that
(?)
Pussy cats are kittens and they under the button fly
(We all love Jack)
Said the girls, just the girls
So hand me the gel because we had it whipped up like Jheri curls
(?) watch out man Jack will raise a fat gat
(Yo move out my way, step off)
(Gimme that) Dope
D-d-diddy dope
No, we need no rope
If you cross the wrong path you'll smell the gun smoke-smoke
Of the barrel, that big pork and barrel
If you mess around with Jack (?)
He's a pusher, the dope dealer rolling with crazy skins
And he didn't have too many fr-friends
He carried classified ordinance on all gorunds
He wasn't rolling with a gang
That's why sometimes he got beat down
But he came up like a Jack
How?
By selling crack
By selling crack, crack pusher, crack pusher can I have a hit
Wild dope fiend-fiend with the chapped-chapped lips
Over to Jack's project numbers he snuck
Chumps would go to crazy women filled with the fat lust
At the club, dancin', just waitin' for the chancin'
To see if Jack would approach, and ask for some romancin'
Sure enough there's one, now off to the motel
Charizma, what’s her name? Raquel, Raquel, Raquel

Yah baby so its just me and you tonight huh?
*Yeah Jack, I always have liked you best*
Oh so I guess that means you with this huh
*Yah I'm with this, just (?)*

[Verse 2]
In and out without no doubt, clap for it all
He was swinging his back, swinging his back
Washing through the walls
(Where?) there
Everywhere, all over the bedroom
She said that Jack reminded her of a broom
That sweeps up the dirt and the dust-dust
But five times Jack had to bust-bust boom
Tearing off rubber-rubber like thunder
Hopped inside the bed and then pulled over the covers
Zz’s Zz’s catchin, now they're both counting sheep
They're both (?) bodies, now they're falling asleep
Jack
Wakes up, wakes up in the morning
Looks to the left and says ""What the hell's going on?"" and
""Raquel where you at""
Yo where did she go-go
It seems like a case of Jack don't know-know
Definately-definately we have a problem here
He smelled his underarms
And they're kicking like Rudolph the Red-Nosed reindeer
Slide to the bathroom to get rid of it
And then he noticed on the mirror there was a note writting in lipstick
It said
*Jack I'm sorry that I had to go
And I apologize for not letting you know
But get this, there's something that might make you faint
I hate to break it to you
Cause you do now have the AIDS*
Oh my god, lord have mercy-mercy
Jack you caught the HIV, curse it, curse it
You should have known to wear a Jimmy hat
Poor old Jack

I'll rock the bass when I

I'll rock the bass when I

[Breakdown]
Too many get hung up these days on
What a style a track is, you know?
I hear people saying shit like
""This track cool, that track is cool,"" you know?
Just because it's on this label or on that label
Music for me was never just about
Which DJ played more songs
Which label is cool
It's always been much more than that
Music is touching generations
Liberating cultures
Make people fall in love
Make people cry
It's true emotion
So, when people ask why my song has that timeless feel to them?
That's what I need to explain
It's on the very nature of how I write my songs

[Drop]
I'll rock the bass when I
I rock the place
I'll rock the bass when I

I'll rock the bass when I

393,22632,What It Is,Eyes Everywhere,"[Mos Def/Yasiin Bey]
The way I feel
Sometime it's just hard to sit still
Life is too passionate, life is too real
Sometime I gotta chill, mellow back, blow a smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the street the people breathe without hope
They going through the motion
They dimming down the focus
The focus get clear then the light turn sharp
And the eyes get teary
The mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometime ya'll don't hear me
I'll push it through a bass note maybe ya'll will feel me
I feel it in my bones and I'm so wide awake
I'm hardly ever sleep, my flow forever deep
When there's volumes of scriptures for volumes of beats
My presence speaks volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement or curb
Cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a shelf
Universal ghetto life holler black and know it well
Quiet storm, vital form
Pen push the right across
Line is a vital force
High, low or right across
Sure as a lion's roar
Voice is a siren
Then swing 'round, ring out, bring down a tyrant
Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided
The world is so DANGEROUS there's no need for frightin'
Niggas try to hide like the struggle won't find them
And the sun bust through the cloud to clearly to remind them
It's everywhere: penthouse, pavement to curb
Cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a shelf
Universal ghetto life holler black and know it well
What it is? You know, New York
What it is? Chi-Town, get down
What it is? Dirty south, work it out
The west you are now rockin' with the best

It's the accurate assassin shit
The tool that you get blasted with
It's blacker than when the lights go off after disaster hits
Drop in with it faster but I've mastered it
You crash your whip
Pass it in my lane cause my materials are hazardous (Whoa)
These ain't just punchlines: I'll slap the shit out you
You try to disrespect the style my people blacking out to
This the, manual how to allow true
Skill to flow out you
So you the one that everybody bow to
Money get off your knees, that ain't what I mean
Cutting clean when I murder emcees the blood run inbetween
The gutters so what I utter obscene like Butterbean
Mean like Cinda Williams tight like the Flatbush Brothers in another scene
I'm mo' betta, the flow wetter than an orgasm
The word seize ya 'til ya rollin' on the floor with all sorts of spams
I'm off the chain, off the hook, fuck it, off the wagon
Get emcees mad like Jewish people when they saw The Passion
This that Black Star shit, the Pharaoh with the Cuban cigar
My people locked behind them so I spit bars
Black music, you could ease back relax to it
Pull out gats to it and clap to it
Blow out a back to it
Roll a bag or two or three to it
Blow a tree to it
It's that crack but we added a little poetry to it
Lean back like a smack user, the rap Zab Judah
Get you high without the side effects of your average juicer
What it is? Kweli, like ODB I'm for the kids
You know Black Star, Black Star (What it is?!)
Shining like eight lights we bright

Felt myself and put on my best necklace

They were only down for the after party
Hmmn, my body is ready
And it’s sweeting me like I have jedi jedi
Who else would be hype? Who has the ginger?
Only this guy that I know through my sister
So I hit him up and told him let’s roll
And he told me he’ll pioneer the parole
Now it’s a movement
The night can’t waste
So I got some henny out the stash for a taste
Went out for pre-drinks, squad was chill
But as the time passed, shit got real
I mentioned the movement they said they’ll come through
Now them too were ready to do the do

401,22645,Secret Garden,Drunken Kong,"Magic

Dr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned to it. He had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send some one out to explore the garden paths. When Colin was brought back to his room the poor man looked him over seriously.

“You should not have stayed so long,” he said. “You must not overexert yourself.”

“I am not tired at all,” said Colin. “It has made me well. Tomorrow I am going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.”

“I am not sure that I can allow it,” answered Dr. Craven. “I am afraid it would not be wise.”

“It would not be wise to try to stop me,” said Colin quite seriously. “I am going.”

Even Mary had found out that one of Colin's chief peculiarities was that he did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with his way of ordering people about. He had lived on a sort of desert island all his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his own manners and had had no one to compare himself with. Mary had indeed been rather like him herself and since she had been at Misselthwaite had gradually discovered that her own manners had not been of the kind which is usual or popular. Having made this discovery she naturally thought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin. So she sat and looked at him curiously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone. She wanted to make him ask her why she was doing it and of course she did.

“What are you looking at me for?” he said.

“I'm thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.”

“So am I,” said Colin calmly, but not without an air of some satisfaction. “He won't get Misselthwaite at all now I'm not going to die.”

“I'm sorry for him because of that, of course,” said Mary, “but I was thinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be polite for ten years to a boy who was always rude. I would never have done it.”

“Am I rude?” Colin inquired undisturbedly.

“If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man,” said Mary, “he would have slapped you.”

“But he daren't,” said Colin.

“No, he daren't,” answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quite without prejudice. “Nobody ever dared to do anything you didn't like—because you were going to die and things like that. You were such a poor thing.”

“But,” announced Colin stubbornly, “I am not going to be a poor thing. I won't let people think I'm one. I stood on my feet this afternoon.”

“It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,” Mary went on, thinking aloud.

Colin turned his head, frowning.

“Am I queer?” he demanded.

“Yes,” answered Mary, “very. But you needn't be cross,” she added impartially, “because so am I queer—and so is Ben Weatherstaff. But I am not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before I found the garden.”

“I don't want to be queer,” said Colin. “I am not going to be,” and he frowned again with determination.

He was a very proud boy. He lay thinking for a while and then Mary saw his beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face.

“I shall stop being queer,” he said, “if I go every day to the garden. There is Magic in there—good Magic, you know, Mary. I am sure there is.” “So am I,” said Mary.

“Even if it isn't real Magic,” Colin said, “we can pretend it is. Something is there—something!”

“It's Magic,” said Mary, “but not black. It's as white as snow.”

They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the months that followed—the wonderful months—the radiant months—the amazing ones. Oh! the things which happened in that garden! If you have never had a garden you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden you will know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass there. At first it seemed that green things would never cease pushing their way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in the crevices of the walls. Then the green things began to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, every shade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson. In its happy days flowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner. Ben Weatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from between the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging things to grow on. Iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas.

“She was main fond o' them—she was,” Ben Weatherstaff said. “She liked them things as was allus pointin' up to th' blue sky, she used to tell. Not as she was one o' them as looked down on th' earth—not her. She just loved it but she said as th' blue sky allus looked so joyful.”

The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tended them. Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score, gaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which it might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had got there. And the roses—the roses! Rising out of the grass, tangled round the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their branches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long garlands falling in cascades—they came alive day by day, hour by hour. Fair fresh leaves, and buds—and buds—tiny at first but swelling and working Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent delicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden air.

Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took place. Every morning he was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn't rain he spent in the garden. Even gray days pleased him. He would lie on the grass “watching things growing,” he said. If you watched long enough, he declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves. Also you could make the acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on various unknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if they were trees from whose tops one could look out to explore the country. A mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and making its way out at last with the long-nailed paws which looked so like elfish hands, had absorbed him one whole morning. Ants' ways, beetles' ways, bees' ways, frogs' ways, birds' ways, plants' ways, gave him a new world to explore and when Dickon revealed them all and added foxes' ways, otters' ways, ferrets' ways, squirrels' ways, and trout' and water-rats' and badgers' ways, there was no end to the things to talk about and think over.

And this was not the half of the Magic. The fact that he had really once stood on his feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when Mary told him of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved of it greatly. He talked of it constantly.

“Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,” he said wisely one day, “but people don't know what it is like or how to make it. Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen. I am going to try and experiment.”

The next morning when they went to the secret garden he sent at once for Ben Weatherstaff. Ben came as quickly as he could and found the Rajah standing on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling.

“Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,” he said. “I want you and Dickon and Miss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tell you something very important.”

“Aye, aye, sir!” answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his forehead. (One of the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his boyhood he had once run away to sea and had made voyages. So he could reply like a sailor.)

“I am going to try a scientific experiment,” explained the Rajah. “When I grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am going to begin now with this experiment.”

“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was the first time he had heard of great scientific discoveries.

It was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at this stage she had begun to realize that, queer as he was, Colin had read about a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincing sort of boy. When he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on you it seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though he was only ten years old—going on eleven. At this moment he was especially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination of actually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.

“The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,” he went on, “will be about Magic. Magic is a great thing and scarcely any one knows anything about it except a few people in old books—and Mary a little, because she was born in India where there are fakirs. I believe Dickon knows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn't know he knows it. He charms animals and people. I would never have let him come to see me if he had not been an animal charmer—which is a boy charmer, too, because a boy is an animal. I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us—like electricity and horses and steam.”

This sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited and really could not keep still. “Aye, aye, sir,” he said and he began to stand up quite straight.

“When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,” the orator proceeded. “Then something began pushing things up out of the soil and making things out of nothing. One day things weren't there and another they were. I had never watched things before and it made me feel very curious. Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be scientific. I keep saying to myself, 'What is it? What is it?' It's something. It can't be nothing! I don't know its name so I call it Magic. I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and from what they tell me I am sure that is Magic too. Something pushes it up and draws it. Sometimes since I've been in the garden I've looked up through the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast. Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing. Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it must be all around us. In this garden—in all the places. The Magic in this garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a man. I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong. I don't know how to do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come. Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it. When I was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept saying to herself as fast as she could, 'You can do it! You can do it!' and I did. I had to try myself at the same time, of course, but her Magic helped me—and so did Dickon's. Every morning and evening and as often in the daytime as I can remember I am going to say, 'Magic is in me! Magic is making me well! I am going to be as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!' And you must all do it, too. That is my experiment Will you help, Ben Weatherstaff?”

“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff. “Aye, aye!”

“If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through drill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment succeeds. You learn things by saying them over and over and thinking about them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will be the same with Magic. If you keep calling it to come to you and help you it will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things.” “I once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs who said words over and over thousands of times,” said Mary.

“I've heard Jem Fettleworth's wife say th' same thing over thousands o' times—callin' Jem a drunken brute,” said Ben Weatherstaff dryly. “Summat allus come o' that, sure enough. He gave her a good hidin' an' went to th' Blue Lion an' got as drunk as a lord.”

Colin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes. Then he cheered up.

“Well,” he said, “you see something did come of it. She used the wrong Magic until she made him beat her. If she'd used the right Magic and had said something nice perhaps he wouldn't have got as drunk as a lord and perhaps—perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet.”

Ben Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his little old eyes.

“Tha'rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,” he said. “Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I'll give her a bit of a hint o' what Magic will do for her. She'd be rare an' pleased if th' sinetifik 'speriment worked—an' so 'ud Jem.”

Dickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round eyes shining with curious delight. Nut and Shell were on his shoulders and he held a long-eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.

“Do you think the experiment will work?” Colin asked him, wondering what he was thinking. He so often wondered what Dickon was thinking when he saw him looking at him or at one of his “creatures” with his happy wide smile.

He smiled now and his smile was wider than usual.

“Aye,” he answered, “that I do. It'll work same as th' seeds do when th' sun shines on 'em. It'll work for sure. Shall us begin it now?”

Colin was delighted and so was Mary. Fired by recollections of fakirs and devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sit cross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.

“It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,” said Colin. “I'm rather tired and I want to sit down.”

“Eh!” said Dickon, “tha' mustn't begin by sayin' tha'rt tired. Tha' might spoil th' Magic.”

Colin turned and looked at him—into his innocent round eyes.

“That's true,” he said slowly. “I must only think of the Magic.” It all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their circle. Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he had somehow been led into appearing at a prayer-meeting. Ordinarily he was very fixed in being what he called “agen' prayer-meetin's” but this being the Rajah's affair he did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at being called upon to assist. Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured. Dickon held his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made some charmer's signal no one heard, for when he sat down, cross-legged like the rest, the crow, the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made part of the circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their own desire.

“The 'creatures' have come,” said Colin gravely. “They want to help us.”

Colin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought. He held his head high as if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a wonderful look in them. The light shone on him through the tree canopy.

“Now we will begin,” he said. “Shall we sway backward and forward, Mary, as if we were dervishes?”

“I canna' do no swayin' back'ard and for'ard,” said Ben Weatherstaff. “I've got th' rheumatics.”

“The Magic will take them away,” said Colin in a High Priest tone, “but we won't sway until it has done it. We will only chant.”

“I canna' do no chantin'“ said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily. “They turned me out o' th' church choir th' only time I ever tried it.”

No one smiled. They were all too much in earnest. Colin's face was not even crossed by a shadow. He was thinking only of the Magic.

“Then I will chant,” he said. And he began, looking like a strange boy spirit. “The sun is shining—the sun is shining. That is the Magic. The flowers are growing—the roots are stirring. That is the Magic. Being alive is the Magic—being strong is the Magic. The Magic is in me—the Magic is in me. It is in me—it is in me. It's in every one of us. It's in Ben Weatherstaff's back. Magic! Magic! Come and help!”

He said it a great many times—not a thousand times but quite a goodly number. Mary listened entranced. She felt as if it were at once queer and beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on. Ben Weatherstaff began to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable. The humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into a doze. Dickon sat cross-legged with his rabbit asleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb's back. Soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder, the gray film dropped over his eyes. At last Colin stopped.

“Now I am going to walk round the garden,” he announced.

Ben Weatherstaff's head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with a jerk.

“You have been asleep,” said Colin.

“Nowt o' th' sort,” mumbled Ben. “Th' sermon was good enow—but I'm bound to get out afore th' collection.”

He was not quite awake yet.

“You're not in church,” said Colin.

“Not me,” said Ben, straightening himself. “Who said I were? I heard every bit of it. You said th' Magic was in my back. Th' doctor calls it rheumatics.”

The Rajah waved his hand.

“That was the wrong Magic,” he said. “You will get better. You have my permission to go to your work. But come back tomorrow.”

“I'd like to see thee walk round the garden,” grunted Ben.

It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt. In fact, being a stubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he had made up his mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and look over the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were any stumbling.

The Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession was formed. It really did look like a procession. Colin was at its head with Dickon on one side and Mary on the other. Ben Weatherstaff walked behind, and the “creatures” trailed after them, the lamb and the fox cub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping to nibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge.

It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity. Every few yards it stopped to rest. Colin leaned on Dickon's arm and privately Ben Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his hand from its support and walked a few steps alone. His head was held up all the time and he looked very grand.

“The Magic is in me!” he kept saying. “The Magic is making me strong! I can feel it! I can feel it!”

It seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him. He sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he sat down on the grass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon, but he would not give up until he had gone all round the garden. When he returned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he looked triumphant.

“I did it! The Magic worked!” he cried. “That is my first scientific discovery.”.

“What will Dr. Craven say?” broke out Mary.

“He won't say anything,” Colin answered, “because he will not be told. This is to be the biggest secret of all. No one is to know anything about it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any other boy. I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be taken back in it. I won't have people whispering and asking questions and I won't let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded. Then sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shall just walk into his study and say 'Here I am; I am like any other boy. I am quite well and I shall live to be a man. It has been done by a scientific experiment.'“

“He will think he is in a dream,” cried Mary. “He won't believe his eyes.”

Colin flushed triumphantly. He had made himself believe that he was going to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he had been aware of it. And the thought which stimulated him more than any other was this imagining what his father would look like when he saw that he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers' sons. One of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days had been his hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father was afraid to look at him.

“He'll be obliged to believe them,” he said.

“One of the things I am going to do, after the Magic works and before I begin to make scientific discoveries, is to be an athlete.”

“We shall have thee takin' to boxin' in a week or so,” said Ben Weatherstaff. “Tha'lt end wi' winnin' th' Belt an' bein' champion prize-fighter of all England.”

Colin fixed his eyes on him sternly.

“Weatherstaff,” he said, “that is disrespectful. You must not take liberties because you are in the secret. However much the Magic works I shall not be a prize-fighter. I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.”

“Ax pardon—ax pardon, sir” answered Ben, touching his forehead in salute. “I ought to have seed it wasn't a jokin' matter,” but his eyes twinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased. He really did not mind being snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strength and spirit.

1° parte[Basquiat]

Minha primeira dama me trocou pelos cotas da banda
Esse meu nigga ta sempre a tentar na minha dama
De madrugada, ouvi gritos de uma dama, acho q foi violada
Pretos a roubarem no 3° andar pela varanda

Lembro-me da vez q deram surra num dos bradas
Levado pelos babas
Passo pela rua à seguir a minha
E dou de cara com o mesmo Brada, Brada

Mas tu não queres saber disso
Queres saber da gera que ouviste dos meus amigos
Nem sabias que foram os amigos dos meus amigos
Eu nem sabia q o inimigo seria um dos meus amigos

Então, não adianta contar, não vais acreditar
E quando eu precisar não vais estar comigo
Gente nova é conhecida ou sócia
Safoda esses novos amigos

Porque eu penso muito, mas tira o penso que eu mudo
Perguntas sobres os meus niggas e eu fico mudo
E esse vosso mundo, cheio de falsos imundos
De vocês não quero muito só respeito mútuo

E quanto a insultos, de cotas burros
E mais novos que eu, não ligo esses putos
Raízes com inveja do seu próprio fruto
Vão tentar mandar a baixo work desse puto


Refrão[Crazy Boy]

Essa não é dama daquele Brada?
Nigga age como se não visses nada
O nigga ta contigo todos dias
E vai te espetar com uma faca

E tu ainda nem viste nada
Nigga não se passa nada
Não se passa nada
Bitches e Fakes nigga tão contigo na quebrada
Mas o melhor é agires tipo não se passa nada

Eu quero mudar o mundo apenas sendo real
E se o mundo não sentir, around me they gone feel
Eu quero mudar o mundo apenas sendo real
E se o mundo não sentir around me they gone feel

Então não vou agir tipo não se passa nada
Tipo não se passa nada
Quero mais massa pra pausar com a família e os bradas
Então não posso agir tipo não se passa nada

Mãe o que eu escolhi pra te agradar não está a dar certo
Mas sinto q aquilo q eu quero ta bem perto
O quê?, como? e quando? ainda não sei certo
E se eu morrer mais cedo é pq vi a felicidade de perto

Ou então tou a rolling com os Bros
A shainar nessas hoes, querem brigas e eu?, No
Vou levar esses Bros e vou produzir os sons
And I'm running na 50 com os meus woes

Projectando ideias q vôces ainda não percebem
Puto mais quente se eu não for mais quente, que me levem
Ela era  porreirissima
Não se controlou e foi vítima

Das bebidas e as drogas do boda
Tantos niggas perdeu conta das fodas
Mais uma mboa, traumatizada
Com o q a juventude acha q é estar na moda

Possas!!! Esse nigga quer lutar pq? (BOELO!!!)
Tanta confusão só por uma mulher? (BOELO!!!)
Tipo não é dele, também só ta se fazer (BOELO!!!)
Vão lhe levar fora só pra lhe bater (BOELO!!!)

Só mais um nigga pkausa da mina
Vai com a cabeça aberta no biva
Pena do nigga q nem sabia
Lutou por uma mboa muito bandida

Dance with your people
You gotta catch the vibe

Said 'Mom, I'm fixin' it, you know, I'm getting the groove right'

Ladies, fellas, don't drunk dial your exes
Hello, bouncer, I have a job for you
While I'm dancing, watch my shoes
Tonight is the night that we rendezvous
Sweat the fountain of youth, bust a move
Fringe jacket, pants of leather
Tanktop, spandex and pleather
Been a stressful week, I got a lot of pressure
You have a lot of great moves but mine are better

[Hook: Idris Elba]
I challenge you to a dance off
Hands off, no trash talk, no back walk
On the black top, just me, you, that's all
No cat calls, no tag teams, no mascots
Right now, dance off (Dance off)
Get on the floor
Get on the, get on the floor, go
Get on the floor, do it
Come on and get on the floor, go

[Post-Hook: Instrumental Breakdown]
Rewind
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
(Dance off)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Oh Lord, I can't sit down
Better hold my phone, I'm going for the crown, good God
But I'm confident this is my town
Better hope my feet don't fail me now, good God

[Outro: Idris Elba]
I challenge you to a dance off
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Get on the floor
Get on the, get on the floor, go

If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat a nigga up like its fight night
If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat the boy ass like its fight night

[Verse 1: Echo]
Shawty suck me up like a Klondike
Shawty said she love me, I ain't for the hype
Niggas mad cause I ball like Mike
Niggas mad cause I get em all tight
Can’t trust shawty she too nice
Got old money with new ice
Can't catch feelings catch the next flight
We're the Wolfpack we do bite
Come to the top with your new heights
How you get in this party without an invite
Pussy ass boy you ain’t right
Talking that shit I dislike
This is a new flame we ignite
Don't talk, I don't need your advice
Took a risk, I rolled the dice
Down to fight anyone, name the price

[Verse 2: Bobby Hundon]
Put em in a coffin like Von Maur
Giving out binks no jar jar (buh buh)
Moving too wrong won't get far (get far)
Nigga want the static we jump starting (god damn)
Ric flair knots in the figure 4 (woo)
Money in the bank now I'm off the ropes (off)
Not catching me far from a nympho (nympho)
Playing her chords she switch notes (switch notes)
Whip so foreign no key to this (key to this)
VVS dance so devious (vvs)
My niggas pouring up that CVS (drank)
Smoking dead opps relieve the stress
Put in the word they do the rest (who next)
Put out the word, Now who next (who that)
Better watch out for your crewneck
Two thots tryna give me top that's crewneck (euhhh)
Plenty more, Nothing lesser, There ain't no cap like I'm headless
Call up the pastors and reverends
Fight night send you to heaven
Keeping a brick on the pedal
Winning the race gold medals
You not on my level forever (Hundon)
Can do what you do with no effort
AH AH, Understand or stand out
My finger start itchin, Man down (bllrr)
Handouts, Never that (uh uh), He ran out
Don’t come back, Big facts, Bigger racks
Double that, Triple that, Get the back end, No give backs

[Chorus: Echo]
If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat a nigga up like its fight night
If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat the boy ass like its fight night
If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat a nigga up like its fight night
If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat the boy ass like its fight night

[Verse 3: Aquah]
When we kick doors, better get low
Run in the nigga crib, we on tip toe
Point the blicky at your kinfo
He want smoke, then his gun smokes
Then on ten toes, she on all foes
Chain cuban and the watch froze
Got the shooter with me, he don’t watch sports
I run from cops and dodge in court
Young nigga came up with no support
They talking scores, but my niggas ball
I don't fuck with condoms cause the nigga raw
I don’t need the blicky, bust the nigga jaw
Blowing money fast like a nigga Ross
Gangsta leave in silence
And all you niggas do is talk

[Chorus: Echo]
If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat a nigga up like its fight night
If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat the boy ass like its fight night
If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat a nigga up like its fight night
If we see him again, then its on sight
Beat the boy ass like its fight night

And Clay from the Tre, it spells game over
See some are original, some afilliated
Some just know Screw, and sit around and say it
I'm an original, and got the balls to say it
Five star general, my skills will display it
Our Screw style, has been called it copied and traced
We bout to change that, and put it back in it's place
M.J. and Den, provided us the space
So we can congregate, and put boys in they place
Dressed in fatigues, the guns and boots laced
Ready to rapid fire, at any sound of bass
This hard shit we spitting, the world gon embrace
And see it's more to Houston, than just Flip and 'Face
C-Note and Red, y'all both got my blessings
It's not my fault, y'all didn't attend the sessions
Don't get me wrong, or be under the impression
I'm not dissing you boys, but let this be a lesson
We came together, we claimed together
It's now or never, let's get this change together
We're all Screw soldiers, everybody I named
Some soldiers locked up, some soldiers were slained
And Lil' Flip I thank you, for repping the name
You're afilliated now, the last link on the chain
Not trying to hate, or make it divisional
But the Screwed Up Click, was built around the originals

Those bad hoes only stole my soul, but I gave it away to the drugs first
Caskets full of dead friends I'd do anything just to reverse
Zero-nine on the t shirt,  your whole squad follows me first
I said it I meant I never went backwards, I sat on the field and I popped all my activis
I've been rolling up,  I got codeine in my cup
And I'm on with my boys we ain't made to give it up

Old School new Style not that new Age Crap
Use it for Communication, to the People I'm Relatin
Give the Words of Inspiration and to lead for their Salvation
Me and Hip-Hop got a True Relationship
Been Married Long Time won't Divorce for (ish)
In the Late 90's I turned out we lost two Legends
Non can fill the Void Pac, Big Left to Heaven
Let's not forget about the others Big L, Pimp C, Eazy-E
Freaky Tah, Big Stank Hank, & Jam Master Jay whom I seen

The True King here of Rap Music is back more Gifted
Than before now Hungrier than a Wolf in a Dogpack
Brand New (ish), that new Street Crack

(Jay-Z Hook)

(Tru-Dru Verse Third/Final):
Now I gots to give Props to my (Blank) Cassidy
The other day he inspired me to rip this Beat
Ever since Rap Music's Mother Reggae put her on the Scene
In 69 in Jamaica and 73 We took it overseas
It's A New Revolution Tru Emperahz Running it
(Blank) can't stay off my (Blank), Im so Slick like Rick
And I' m not havin' it, get Rage like Hulk Throwing Fits
Cause Rukkus for the Heck of it, Enemies fall hella Quick
16 Bars and Hot Lines be Tasty like a Hallibut
Y' all know y'all really feeling this, cuz I'm (Blank) Killing this
Never when I shoot I miss always stay on Target
All about the Money and the Game Itch then Switch
Making all the Dough it's my Blessings come True
And what's good for me means more Problems for you
Since the Age of 5, been nice on the Mic here's the Evidence
I can't leave Rap alone we are Heaven Sent

I like us better when we're wasted

Sipping my ocean dry

Common Sense is in your town

[Verse 1: Common Sense]
I stagger in the gathering possessed by a pattering
That be scattering over the global
My vocals be traveling, unraveling my abdomen
It’s slime that’s babbling grammatics that are masculine
I grab them in, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
Raps I make up like blacks do excuses
I feel like Noah, hooking my mellows up on deuces
If a broad ain’t got a mind, a job or crib, she useless
Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines
They say signs of the end is near.  I wonder
“Can I walk a righteous path holding a beer?”
Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager
Skills uglier than Craig Mack “In Ya Ear,” I’m the “Flava”
My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise
Don’t watch the Bulls as much—(why?)—they got too many white boys
A million black men walking towards one direction
For sure, the cream of the planets
Resurrection

[Verse 2: Common Sense]
A prophet raised amongst Black Disciples
And Vice Lords who don’t give a fuck about mic cords
At night, swords get up.  Together, black wrists get cuffed
I’m wishing for a change, but my man want his change in a cup
Yes Sir, I’m in the Mix-a-Lot
Bitches put ‘em on the glass while I’m putting stickers on their ass
I rule everything around me like cash
On the rocks of reality, dreams get splashed.  In jams
I M*A*S*H like Alan Alda.  Niggas nod
Thangs say, “Hey,” as if I was Little Walter
87 strip-walker, taught the code of the area
By staying within the barrier.  Exposed to
Stony stimuli—with that, I identify
Brothers went through my rotate, solidify the realness
Skull caps, Smurfs, Puffy jacket, Lugz boots on
Stepping to me is like going to the County being a neutron

[Verse 3: Common Sense]
I ride
The rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light, I use
Insight to enlight, then write something that’s skin-tight
Words of wisdom well from my windpipe, imagination’s
In flight, I send light—like Ben’s kite, I’ve been bright
Get open like on gym nights.  In fights, I send rights
Don’t hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
I’ve been indicted as a freak of all trades
“Doodoo-Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo,” I got it made
I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums.  Had
To halt with the malt liquor ‘cause off the malt
Liquor, I fought niggas.  Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruising South Side streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back, and we don’t get no thicker
87 got my back and we don’t get no thicker
Chicago got my back and we don’t… now check it
I’m a ho but not a ho nigga, ain’t scared of no nigga
When it’s my turn to go I gotta go, and I’m gone with the
Storm…

Gave her a 1000 chances
All of them was took for granted
I know that it's stupid
I was a loner shot by the cupid
You say it so cutely
Turn around ok thats stupid

No control im fully hooked in

It's nothing personal
Strictly professional
But, I guess it kinda is
Cause the booth is my confessional
I'm god
And this that gospel
Dope shit
Chop it up and put it in your nostril
What's a rolly to a Fossil?
Jesus Holy to an apostle?
And if I'm god
Then Jesus just told me you were awful
""Oh that's awful""
Nah, ya'll just too caught up in giving a fuck
I'm giving it up
And living it up
Living it up

[Verse 2: Pre$to]

I'll be damned if I spend my final hour
Asking for forgiveness from a higher power
That would mean I died a coward
Life's a bitch, you buy her flowers
I just fuck her on the low
To be honest, probably the reason I ain't got long to go
Oh, and Crucial
Is my refusal
To stay neutral
And by that, I mean where I'm at
And not my pupils
Cause I got my target locked in
Supreme flows got em' boxed in
Probably not in your top ten
But that's cool cause
I'm not them
Ya'll forever late
Elevate
What's a feather to a fucking heavyweight
Never great

523,22804,This Song,Mike La Funk,"[Verse 1]
Shotty under the seat, windows tinted and up
Runners walk in the streets, numbers folded and stuffed
Into the bicycle spokes with little men watching the corners
Knocks are all walking the beat the living dead, don't need your mourning
They need a fix, tell 'em this song is it
This is the hours of terror you walk from minutes of bliss
This is the shit you don't tell no one you don't want to see cry, 'cause (No one wants their friends to die)
This is a necessary transaction to keep your economy active
Activation, demographics, keep all the outliers passing
Passing the pistol man, they whistling shots
Pick up the juice in the fizzle baby he ain't getting caught
Put the freebase away, cause the block got hot
(We make the day go pop, pop, pop!)
Yeah, we bring the yé, you're cops on cop
Bullets gon' spray, the choppers gon' chop

[Hook]
This song is a drug deal
This song will fuck you up
This song will get suckers killed
This song don't give a fuck
This song is probably your phone
Hold in a Styrofoam cup
You should play this song if you want to get turnt up

[Verse 2]
Nights with no stars in the city with more cars than spaces
Outside clubs where inside suits talk TV sipping ace of spades
And you can call it (Shangri-la)
As long as all your shades are dark enough, you call it (Shangri-la)
Keep your veil on where you're married to the streets, it's (Shangri-la)
Have you seen it? (Shangri-la)
And when you suck on what's in this, it is the closest thing to God
Take a walk to the smell of rotting life on the air on a trail of smoke
Wrapped in a swisher sweet like dreams are made of these evoke
A black Saturn with the top on ragged in the alley way off of seventh street
And the beat down low with a shift in park and the glow of the lamplight flickering
And a group of men with their clothes on ragged being nonchalant
With the ambiance is obviously dagger to the jugular
Who want to fuck with the waiting room for the voluntary incremental suicide
Is a suicide with suicide with thirty eyes like, ""Who am I?""
But it look like, ""Who are you?""
And If you here you look too
Like a knock with your life on ragtime bag time bagpipe, hit it, don't stop, get it

[Hook]
This song is a drug deal
This song will fuck you up
This song will get suckers killed
This song don't give a fuck
This song is probably your phone
Hold in a styrofoam cup

[Verse 3]
Everyday decapitation ordinary pain
In the bloodshot windows to the soul where pushers are ordained
And turn the dial to the right is the only way you gain
Thirty years of turning trickster trees and blaming it on rain
(You know there's nothing like the real thing!)
So you keep the coke driest, driest
(You know I'm talking 'bout ice queen!)
This paint job the flyest, flyest
(Talkin' 'bout you and me, baby!)
This some shit you should see, baby
Bitch, this shit ain't free and you should bring the money to me
You wanna hear cause you're pipe on E
And you're skin all itchin' and instead they hitting
And they never miss and you miss your mom
And you missed your calling because you came up with cloudy piss
And your bitch is what, bitch is what?
Hold up, who you calling a bitch?
UNITS is what we move and may God bless

[Hook]
This song is a drug deal
This song will fuck you up
This song will get suckers killed
This song don't give a fuck

(Hey, y'all got two for five, two for five?
Them motherfuckers got garbage down there, son
Hopping over barbed wire fences
I had this one bitch, she was so sprung, she used to hold my.. hold my motherfucking sack, ho!)

Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
'Til next year?

God, I can’t do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door

Viața-i un cadou frumos și unu' de căcat
E de căcat să trăiești în România de fapt
Nu că e ceață, praf, e un sistem bolnav
Într-o țară frumoasă pe care-o fac pilaf
Târfe ordinare cu un singur scop
Să ne sece pe toți ca ei să fie-n top
Nu contează cine moare, dacă moare, cum trăiește
Că oamenii se-aruncă de pe blocuri orbește
Că oamenii-și dau foc, (Oh) că nu au de mâncare
Că se moare în spitale de atâta nepăsare
Că se spânzură copiii de dor pentru părinți (Tatăl Nostru care ne ești în ceruri)
Plecați afară, unii cu multă școală (Sfințească-se numele Tău)

Eh, eh
De chico siempre cogía lo mismo cuando jugaba poli o ladrón
Había que forzar la cerradura si quería entrar en una mansión
Lo bueno o malo, eso es relativo, según cual sea tu posición
Seguiré siendo el mismo borrego aunque me vistiera un diseñador
Como una rata en laboratorio inyectaron odio a mi bendición
Y con el tiempo caes en el sueño, te manipulan, te vuelve' un clon
La educación que nos impusieron era un proceso e' fabricación
Luchando por quedar el primero me alimentaron con ambición
Mis referentes vendían drogas, robaban bancos, iban a prisión
Y yo mirando desde la grada con mis ojitos de admiración
Si la misión me salía bien el de la victoria era tradición
Di gracias por to'a la inspiración
Flashback, flashback, flashback, flashback

[Verso 2]
Manejo energía en una cueva como Yoda
El valor de tu tiempo, ese es el precio en cada dólar
Gasto dos semanas en Italia por la moda
Me pongo ese piquete y siento que soy gilipollas
Mi banco dice ""bien"" y mi mente un ""siguen olla""
No me hable' de brillo (no), tú no ere' la joya
Hago movimientos, soy tres vasos y una bola
Y tu te esta' fumando el puro y no hay boda, que le jodan
Yo me pego hard al beat, es Super Glue
Cuando todos van de rojo siempre miran al de azul
Es mi madre y no Endesa quien a mí me dio la luz
Llevo lo importante dentro: huevos Kinder, Bubbaloo
Mira, igual tú me conoces, yo no sé quién eres tú
La cara de pagar tres mil por [?] en Puerto Banús, huh
Fue pa' dar un show la única vez que fui a Cancún
Hice cuatro años de tour, tengo flashback, flashback, flashback, flashback
Abre esa botella de Cardhu, vamos a recordar
Cuando estábamos tirao' en la calle y no había de ná'
Era más sencillo, no podía volver la vista atrás
To'l partido por jugar
Flashback, flashback, flashback, flashback

Pitxu, anfeta, boca, seca

Tengo un speed amarillo
Si está bueno te lo pillo
Está muy bien pa'l jolgorio
Lo hago en mi laboratorio

Esnifa, esnifa, esnifa, esnifa
La cocaína es futbolistas
Puesto de pitxu pego un falangista
Speed por el culo, la tocha o vagina
Mandíbula me baila sardanas
De esnifar por el culo me ha salido una almorrana
Velocidad para toda la semana
Me meto speed, porque me sale de la polla
Speed, como sé del speed los ingredientes
Speed, lo preparo para mí, para mi gente

Y hace un tiempo que he venido cuidando mi corazón
Pa' no maltratar el alma
Y es que con ella es con la única que puedo ser quien soy
Mantienes mi monstruo en calma
Y hace un tiempo que he venido cuidando mi corazón
Y no maltratar el alma

El hecho de respirar vuelve mi vida easy
Y yo quiero más, más, más, más de ti
De todo eso que me das
Más paz, my baby
De tu booty, de tu paz
De tu mente crazy
El hecho de respirar vuelve mi vida easy

[Verso 1: Afaz Natural]
De solo poner mi mirada encima
Me ibas a hacer desearte toda la vida
Si te quedas o te vas, no tengo salida
Cualquiera de las dos me va a arrancar la vida
Y lamer tu piel es como la fruta prohibida
Y acercarme se considera un acto suicida
Pues no me siento capaz y en definitiva
De jugar con fuego y poder escapar con vida, have mercy

[Coro: Afaz Natural & Soler The Lion]
Y yo quiero más, más, más de ti
De todo eso que me das
Más paz, my baby
De tu booty, de tu paz

Y yo quiero más, más, más, más de ti
De todo eso que me das
Más paz, my baby
De tu booty, de tu paz
De tu mente crazy
El hecho de respirar vuelve mi vida easy

[Verso 2: Soler The Lion]
Yo no te olvidé, pero gusto en conocerte
Pero fuiste tú la que llegó y se paró al frente
Trato de ser como siempre, portarme indiferente
Pero mis sentidos creo que pensaron diferente
Mi miente dijo ""Pana, ya no avances más""
Mis ojos respondieron ""Solo otro minuto más""
Mi voz se confundió, comenzó a hablar más idiomas
Y el corazón gritando ""Quiero más, no hay vuelta atrás"" ’ego

534,22895,Go Home,Sovieti,"Waiting at the corner where we used to meet
Hands in your pockets, awkward shuffling your feet
Trying to make the first move but you walk on by
It's not like you to be timid, not like you to be shy
Just don't know what to say
So you turn around honey and you walk away
But I'm still waiting, still waiting there
But I'm so tired of waiting for you to care

GO HOME you've been here too long
Everybody wants to see you gone
GO HOME you've been here too long
Telling me you could never do me wrong

Won't you smile won't you smile for me
Won't you laugh won't you joke won't you be happy
Lift your head up stop looking at the floor
Trying to act all tough, slamming every door
Don't have a tantrum and make a scene
Still the same old you, still the same old me
But I know you and it's not your style
Stop being stupid and give us a smile

And she says, GO HOME I don't care for you
Laughing and joking as if I do
She says GO HOME time to leave this town
Stop laughing joking and clowning around

De touca, black, trança
Foda-se se olhou desconfiado

''Não olha pra ele, amor, que eu tô bravo''

Cês vive a base de crocs
Não quero mais meu som no seu iPod (Gang)
Black Daddy Trap Lord
777 preto jovem
Swag swag, nego pop

[Verso 2: Raffa Moreira]
A noite de ontem foi foda, mano, vou falar (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Colei no shopping, tinha uns kit, mano, pra pagar (Uh, uh)
Comprei na parcela, passei no cinema normal (Yeah, yeah, uh, uh)
Comprei uma pipoca, o filme eu nem ia pegar (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Trombei um casal estranho, uma loira e um branco (Yeah, yeah)
Ela furou a lupa que eu notei (FERNVNDX Clothing, nego)
E olhou meu olho vermelho, eu tava chapado
Ela pirou em mim que eu notei (Proceder, meu mano)
Mas eu não sou talarico, desviei o olho e fechei a cara, dispiei... (Nóis veio de baixo mano)
Cê tá ligado né mano...

[Verso 3: Imob Zind]
(Quem) corre com nois, ou corre de nois
Cola com nois, ou cola de nois
Os preto aqui, não corre com boy
Os preto atinge sem falar de pó
Na porta de shopping cê pede uma foto
Cê vira as costas sua mina de olho
Os preto de trança com os cordão de ouro
Parece funkeiro, dois risco no rosto
Contando plaquê igual Guimê também
Essas rimas clichê, igual Eminem
Na vitrine poder comprar o Element
Complicado o Zind mal elemento
Igual Fiat 95, Klyn!
Yeah, yeah
(Touca, black, trança)

[Verso 4: Klyn]
Dourado combina com a pele, isso te irrita que eu sei
Fica puto com o preto de luxo, de longe eu flagrei
No corre de Gucci, Armani, é normal pra nois piar de VLONE
Mania de branco é achar que preto não sabe nem o que é um Danone!
Vim pra comprar o estoque, espelho, balcão e a modelo
Eu tenho dinheiro, segurança seguindo, eu não tô entendendo
Viu o verso, se assustou com a minha cor, [?] I got a check
Taxista não parou, pelo amor, piei de Uber Black
Jovem Klyn no avancídio, ele odeia isso
Jovem Klyn no avancídio, sua mina tá se abrindo
Jovem Klyn no avancídio, um preto demais supimpa
Jovem Klyn no avancídio, um preto a mais novo rico

De touca, black, trança
Foda-se se olhou desconfiado
Cutuca a sua mina do seu lado
''Não olha pra ele amor que eu to bravo''
Touca, black, trança

[Verso 5: Blackout]
Eu sei que incomoda um crioulo chave, é fofoca na roda se eu to de Audi
Acostumado a ser desprezado, em menos de um ano eu mudei o resultado
Ainda bem que eu tive manos que o beat me emprestaram
Ainda bem que eu tive manos que me produziu fiado
Imob Gang, beat do Nansy
Essa Trap é trance, contrariando o game
Black Daddy Trap Lord
777 preto jovem
Viu a banca dos nigga, cê corre
Que nois veio tomar o que é nosso

Pop smoke to nahi fir bhi call me "" The Woo Woo ""
Taliyan mai sari loot loon , fir ja ke karta shoot hoops

Cleave, shed and shred, no exception
Believe there's only dread ahead, ain't deception
You thieve, that lead to mе using led, what? Never said it was apprеhension
Dry heave, because of the bloodshed, your gut could use meds before dissection
Do this with obsession for perfection
Move quick with condescension for your transgression
Dismiss this infection, no chances at correction
Ain't remiss, cleared tension in section 8
Rarely miss, my perception, pff, don't even mention, but I still hate
Truth is I deserve the abyss, feel rejection for resurrection
Fate's a bitch, that's come to my attention after reflection

[Verse 3]
This state I'd ditch
I'm straight a glitch
Would be great if I could switch
And be someone else
At this rate I don't know which
Destination waits, it's either Hell's bells
Or being with people who ain't themselves
Holding a station under fire they can't quell
Ignoring the causation that people fell
Cause of your selfish notion, you're hazardous
There's no lotion or potion for that, just a bit of Lazarus
Just don't make a commotion about him being valorous
He's sick, no emotion, for him this life is glamorous

[Verse 4]
But I'm darker than the Dark Knight
My marker marks through the night
Got a red dot
On a bolt, semi or auto gun
Shot, then rot
Stop a revolt and any hit-and-run
Like a cop on a new block
Copping a new Glock
Rocking you like a rock
Blocking a few flocks
Mockingbirds but I'm a Robin
Robbing them robbers of their lives
When I pop in and get popping
Stopping the throbbing of your heart with knives
Master of all blades, a jack of all trades
Not a small blaze, I'm the Ace of Spades
Becoming executioner, judge and jury
Crime for crime, giving death signs
Coming back with nine times the fury
And nine times the arms, I got nines
Oftentimes
Giving punchlines and early bedtimes
Instead of using confines

[Verse 5]
No question, I ain't a Nigma but I'll riddle ya
In an enigmatic fashion
Good intentions to clear the stigma of the uncivil, bruh
Taking pragmatic action
Cooking the second fiddles on a griddle
Watch em beg and swizzle, numbers dwindle
Slice em right down the middle, they so brittle
Their blood will trickle get a triple
Just shoot a pistol, through the nipple
You're in a pickle, cause of nickels
Clear em by little, I belittle
I whittle and cripple, leave em in a hospital
Leave ya scared like crows, no bats
I mean like scarecrows or dead rats
Leave ya lifeless
The solution's timeless

[Verse 6]
Choke ya like a smoker
So you can't joke, Joker
So easy when you can kill it
Never ask for compliance
Acting freely till it's
Clever defiance ends in silence
I ain't a tyrant, just wanna clear the virus
That is the fucker smiling

C'mon baby light my fire (Come on)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything)
Music is supposed to inspire (Music is supposed to inspire)
How come we ain't gettin' no higher? (How come, how come)

[Verse 1]
Now tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?
Now, who you know without any flaws?
That lives above the spiritual laws?
And does anything they feel just because (Just because, just because)
There's always someone there who'll applaud?

[Chorus]
C'mon baby light my fire (Come on)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop is so tired)
Music is supposed to inspire (What are we here for, what are we here for)
How come we ain't gettin' no higher? (Gettin' no higher)

[Verse 2]
I know you think that you've got it all
And by making other people feel small
Makes you think you're unable to fall
But when you do, who you gonna call?
See, what you give is just what you get (What you give is just what you get)
I know it hasn't hit you yet (I know it hasn't hit you yet)
Now, I don't mean to get you upset (Get upset, get upset)
But every cause has an effect, uh-huh!

Everything you drop is so tired (Yeah)
Music is supposed to inspire (Music is supposed to inspire)
So how come we ain't gettin' no higher? (We ain't no higher, we ain't no higher)

[Verse 3]
I cross sands in distant lands, made plans with the sheiks
Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak? Uhh
All I wanted was to sell like five hundred
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album, Blunted
I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me: I fronted
Or I quitted, now I spit it, however do you want it?
Now you get it!
Writing rhymes, in the Range, with the frames lightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (Lauryn Hill!)
And if your lines sound like mine I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)
Unprecedented, and still respected when it's vintage
I'm serious, I'm takin' over areas in Aquarius
Runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots
Just as Christ was a Superstar, you stupid, star!
They'll hail you then nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down, and make you face it
If you slit the bag open, put your pinky in it and taste it

[Chorus]
C'mon baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop, everything you drop)
Music is supposed to inspire (Oh yeah)
How come we ain't gettin no higher? (We ain't getting no higher, getting no higher)
C'mon baby light my fire (C'mon baby light my fire)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop is so tired)
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't gettin no higher? (How come we ain't gettin no higher?)
C'mon baby light my fire (Come on baby)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop is so tired)
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't gettin no higher? (We ain't no higher)

'Bout that time
You start that teasin'

And tap that hole
Make it lose control

Only if only if she can blow my mind

37,23081,Raise,VITIZE,"You Raise Me Up

look inside much deeper then before,
pull out the old crusty, weathered & battered soul
filled with emotion hence the opened door
A willingness by which to humbly explore

You have taken me from dust from the speck on the sun
A bridge of hope to become a beacon of light to a hurting world,
Shelter lies dormant against its beckoning plow
how you fought so hard and fierce,

My one truest love is now gone from here
Out of a mere paradox with angelic hosts to proclaim
You sought me when I was at the bottom of my game
hands, heart & soul

Meekness is not equated as weakness
You bridged the gap between mediocrity & shame
Tossed in turned my frustrations of the day
In a climatic moment being pressed with tears

Shed a single tear to help numb the inner pain
not having you in my arms is driving me insane
You walked on water toward your claim to fame
pools of torments feeling being whisked away

A sparkling array of blissful care
Speaks to the longing I seek to recapture from above.

Non puoi toccarmi
Ma puoi cantare sing
Sopra i tetti e le case
Sing dal telefono
Sing e di nuovo sperare
Let your love be known
Let your love be known

Giorni isolati
Io e te ancora qui
Come sospesi nel tempo
Ho paura di si

Ma viene sempre giorno
Sorridimi sе puoi e andiamo
Che il viaggio del ritorno
È sеmpre il più lontano

Ma sono qui sotto questo cielo
Non puoi toccarmi
Ma puoi cantare siii
Sopra i tetti e le case
Sing al telefono
Sing e di nuovo volare
Sing torneremo lo so

Sing though your heart be overthrown

Sing, there is no distance

Da qualche parte in Germania, ma non saprei bene dove
Cavolo, odio questa parte del Texas
Chiudo gli occhi, fantastico un pò
Tre click e sono a casa
Quando tornerò andrò a coricarmi
Mi alzerò e mi coricherò di nuovo
Idealizzo una vita tranquilla
Nessun posto è come la mia stanza

Ma tu devi andar via, lo so, lo so, lo so
Come un'onda che si schianta e si scioglie sulla riva
Non sono rimasti in giro neppure i tossici ormai
E tu devi andare, lo so, lo so, lo so

In giro per il parco, guardiamo il tramonto
Parlando su un'altalena arrugginita
Dopo un pò sei diventato così silenzioso
E ho capito
Che ti allontano sempre via da me
Ma tu torni indietro come spinto dalla gravità
E quando ti chiamo, tu torni a casa
Un uccellino fra i tuoi denti

[Chorus]
Quindi devo andare, lo so, lo so, lo so
Quando le sirene squillano, ti nasconderai sotto il pavimento
Ma io non mi farò trascinare via con la mia città da un tornado
Lo inseguirò, lo so, lo so, lo so
Quindi ora devo andare, lo so, lo so, lo so

[Bridge]
Guidando verso il sole
Ho lasciato che luce ultravioletta mi coprisse
Sono andata alla ricerca di un mito della creazione
Sono finita con un paio di labbra screpolate
Finestrini abbassati, urlando a squarcia gola
Una canzone rap country da tipico americano
Un mattatoio, un centro commerciale
Macchinette da gioco, paura di Dio
Finestrini abbassati, riscaldamento accesso
Un grande raggio di luce rimasto a mezz'aria
Oltre la costa, sono tutti convinti
Sia un drone del governo o un'astronave aliena
Ad ogni modo, non siamo soli
Troverò un nuovo posto da cui provenire
Una casa infestata con una bella staccionata
Per fluttuare e spaventare come un fantasma i miei amici
No, non ho paura di scomparire
Il manifesto dice ""La fine è vicina""
Mi sono guardata intorno, lì non c'era nulla
Già, suppongo la fine sia qui

[Outro]
La fine è qui
La fine è qui
La fine è qui
La fine è... ahh!

You are the death of me, so why all the lies?
You promised me you wouldn't waste my time, you were my forever now you're out of my life
Down I fall because I thought you were so beautiful, I got so high and felt so musical
Now I'm low just wishin' for more
I'm tryna move up, I call that a score
Give me the levels I'm asking for morе
I'm on top of your game that's for sure
I've finally found thе cure
My music and my rhymes are my lures, I reel you in so here's my tour
My life is a lesson I gotta learn, my heart's on fire this is gonna burn
My love for you is so bold, Why can't you see that?
I put it in a mold, you take it out and let it unfold
You smash it, wait I'm being controlled
I kick you out the door like you did my soul
I tear you apart I set an absolute threshold
Have I gone too far? We'll call that overshoot
My flames light up I see the number 2
Look it up you'll see my purpose
I'm moving up I'm MrBlue
I'm working so hard life's a circus
Playing the game my life is turning
Learning how to tam y'all observing
I'm making moves turning bars into art that's for sure
I know how to confuse your scars word by word
It's easy to get confused, that's when I take my turn
The drugs can be abused, you know that for sure
You take them to heart
Then you lie about some more
You lie so indirectly
You must underestimate me
I wish I could trust you but you lie about simplicity
My love for you is so bold
Why can't you see that? I put it in a mold
You take it out and let it unfold
You smash it, wait I'm being controlled
I kick you out the door like you did my soul
I tear you apart, I set an absolute threshold
Have I gone too far? We'll call that overshoot

Men that crawl on the floor like worms
Nothing is like the death today
Deadly carnage, deadly carnage

Corpses stored like animals
Blood and bowels under the boot
Bodies reduced in shapeless masses
The smell of death is in the air

Atrocious screams lacerate the fleshes
The smell of the ruin on our hairs
At the dawn the blood will paint the ground
Deadly carnage, deadly carnage

The last ruin in flames too
A massacre that smells sick
The winners will drink blood and will eat
Uman fleshes at the end of the day

This slaughter is made
In the name of a Blasphemous god
The bodies of the infidels will be impaled
Deadly carnage, deadly carnage

Today the carnage is the unique law
Tomorrow will be the reason of the grave
The unclean and affected blood will squirt on faces
Will drink blood at the dawn of new day

Hanged corpses lighted at sunrise
Purulent blood that flow under feet
The massacre is made and sacred

93,23151,Bring It Back,Bora,"Sunrey:
Hasbro the way im toyin with em
Flows is what a young boy switchin
If you need the proof, the pudding’s standing right in front of you
Babe ruth with the hits, every day i’m writing one or two

All about that paper, can’t miss a beat
I don’t think that chase would, disagree
If we talking slappers, i’m the king of that
I sing and rap, if we talking stacks

Chase:
I’ll bring it back, if i see ya cap, ima peel it back
Hit his ass like i'm trimmin grass off a chia pet
We to rap, like what metal gear was to sneak attacks (!)
You gon have get up out that box if you gon see success

Hit her with this solid snake and she gon be your ex
And if you think she cut you deep, you should see my back
Hate to beat a dead horse, but i got her in bed more
Than rick in episode 1, comatose with bed sores

Sunrey:
My new attitude cavalier, it’s on quicken loans
I hit every single one of my fucks with eviction notes
Bitter neighbors bitching cause i blast my shit fortissimo
Tryna get my beak up in the bread like chicken tikka rolls (masala)

When i’m on stage, issa sacrament
Born A Rap Savior, peep them letters, issa acronym
Ooh, bring it back if you ain’t catch that shit
Always hostile to these rappers like they backpacking

Chase:
Bring it back, and release the kraken, i'm a beast, you maggot
Reach the magazine, and sear his ass until he hears the masses
U kiss the barrel, get a big bang, y’all can keep the scrappin'
Know when this' K pop, i leave a G draggin'

Red velvet highlights, had to wet 'em up
If she bad i hit it twice, inside her bentley truck
I don't miss a false flagger, when i gun 'em down
Run mothafucka, run, better run, now

Sunrey:
Sun, burn you like a bunsen, you done, blaow
You sound dumbed down, well i’m done, tell you bums, ciao
Coming at your jug, make you gulp, spit your gum out
Two of us buzzing, this just sesh one, like kung pao (yummy!)

Wrote this shit in calcutta, whole crew on the same side, last supper
Those who, tryna take mine shall suffer, i capture the whole movement, like fast shutters, yeah
Ya novia over she get the churro hard, duro
Secret rapper sun leave you in the dark, chiaroscuro

[BEAT SWITCH]

[Verse 2: Chase and Sunrey]

Okay, bring it back, get it back to rap, i got sick of that
Me and walker link up on a track, homie issa wrap
From 44 to the three and a third
We fucking up the game, giving y’all the bees and the birds

You see how we murder, mc’s with just the ease of these words
We takin up the first and second, but you easily third
Don’t take it personal, name a rapper hot as me that you heard
Man, most of y’all still going backwards turning cheese into curd, listen

I guide the squad to the top like a sherpa, ooh
I said take off that bra gimme top like a shirt bruh
I’m finna cop a cavali fur for my mom
Your mcm just chomped down on a tide pod

We transatlantic, tryna cross us there’s a chance you vanish
Crew behind us yeah we troop heavy like afghanistan is
Man the cannons, cameras can’t capture the catalysmic
Catastrophes we exhibit when tellin rappers to can it

Rap my shit and they abandon they ship, like crackin the whip
No juugin’ nor finessin’, they just hand me they shit
Saturday latter day saint, got all your baes in my whip
Happily they get passed down like the family biz

Rappers throw tantrums and diss, i can’t be mad at my kids
Don’t worry i ain’t finna hurt em just a slap on the wrist
But, see this smack go cracking down through your skin and ligaments
Nigga, this shit’ll burn like sunrays on solstices

The most gifted, the hoes don’t get this whole dick
I juxtapose ‘em, just to pose ‘em, just to post a pic
I'm just supposed to boast and coast on every beat we chose to rip
MCs get barbecued, spit roasted, over an open pit

105,23156,Solstice,Boothed,"[Verse 1: ANTHM]
I can’t afford to be the one that failed
Took a leap of faith and I come back frail
And have these motherfuckers laugh, like the pipe dreams of rappin ain't happen for a young black male
Cautionary tale like, remember that nigga?
The former Mr. Wall Street turned rap nigga
He fell flat, nigga
He was well off
Part of my soul I would sell off
Just to show people I ain't fell off
Heart feelin’ frost bit, mentally exhausted
Tear drops for our friendship when we lost it
See you at the crossroads if we cross it
Tryin to determine if my dreams are a force fit
Stressed out, bout to find the next route
Broke as fuck with my chest out, knowin I’m the best out
My sixteen’s got a pristine sound
Would’ve never known I lost fifteen pounds

[Hook] [x2]
Never thought I’d see this day
When I feel so far away
And the stars don’t shine the same
Real late in the midnight hour

[Verse 2: ANTHM]
No doubt, uh, I put my chips up front
And though I knew about the risk up front
Never thought I’d be feeling like my ship done sunk
Nevertheless I’m at the strip club drunk
Despite the lack of funds
Blow a stack of ones
On a bad bitch, showin love to the attractive ones
Can’t find a beauty in my circumstance
Might as well find a beauty if it’s worth a dance
Smart nigga, nothing that I can’t be
I told my family I ain't fuckin’ with no Plan B
But soon enough, gotta validate your love
And chances are that you’ll never understand me
If you’ve never lost faith
Thoughts won't escape
But you carrying your cross til you break
Made some mistakes
If everything I lost is what it takes
I can’t wait to march with the greats

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ANTHM]
They say the way you respond will make you strong
Me and DG developed a bond, we hangin’ on
Been 3 years and now I ponder
How much longer will setbacks continue to pierce my armor
Feels like we crawlin’ back where we started at
He got a call, his mother suffered a heart attack
His little brother got three bullet wounds where they shot him at
Tell me, where’s your God in that?
No religion, it hurts when I smile
Tryin to find joy, ain't no church in the wild
I know I ain't the first person to vow
To treat my music like the birth of a child
My poetry is child-bearing
Get the world to crowd around starin’
Admire the proud parent
Yo, the love’s too deep, I gotta raise the art
Admire the proud parent
Yo, the love's too deep, I gotta raise the art
The opposite of my father who never played the part

[Bridge] [x2]
And I won't lie
I just hold my head high for my friends when they roll by
Feelin’ so low, yet I hold my dreams high to the end so they won't die

And I told that water, peace, be still
And I told it one more time, peace, be still now
And I told that water, please, be still (Joy and Pain)
Peace, be still now
And I told that water, and I told it one more time (Joy and Pain)
Peace, be still now

[Verse 4: ANTHM]
Uh, dear Mama, I know you feel like a broken vessel
I’ll take your burden, and put my shoulders to it
Kissed you on your forehead, said you know you’re special
But the words don’t heal when you’re going through it
Lost your job, lost the crib
You ain't lose your younger son, though you thought you did
I know I came up short, but I support you big
We ain't gotta be famous to feel fortunate
We got each other
Tell my sister that her big brother loves her
Still carryin’ the pictures of her
And I won't stop
Till I got us back
To some peace of mind
I promise that

Can you hear my heart howl at the sky?
It's the wolf that I keep deep inside

But it's only waiting for the moment to break out

Can you hear my heart howl at the sky?
It's the wolf that I keep deep inside

Wanna take a spin? Wanna take a roll?
You know you're dealin' with a wildcard
If you go all in, I'll make your troubles fold
Might take your Diamonds but I'll steal your Heart

[Chorus]
I'm sure you've had a lot of heartaches
But now you've stumbled on a winning hand, a hard Eight
You crossed your fingers and wished upon a shooting star
But now you're dealin' with a wildcard

[Verse 2]
You like my high heels and my lipstick cherry red
You're addicted to the rush
Stop looking for your Queen and sip on Jack instead
I'm here to run the tables, oh, how dare you call my bluff
See, I'm irresistible, kind of unpredictable
Bet you want some action, baby, don't you? Don't you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna take a spin? Wanna take a roll?
You know you're dealin' with a wildcard
If you go all in, I'll make your troubles fold
Might take your Diamonds but I'll steal your Heart

[Chorus]
I'm sure you've had a lot of heartaches
But now you've stumbled on a winning hand, a hard Eight
You crossed your fingers and wished upon a shooting star
But now you're dealin' with a wildcard

Ask me, do I want this?
I'll say ""do birds fly?""
Ask me, do I feel it?
I feel it too high
If you ask me where the past is
I left it behind
And I'm just tryna show you
Every sign

[Pre-Chorus]
When you a star and you looking up at the stars
It just looks like Venus on Mars, let's make this universe ours
Gravity's holding us down so let's turn this planet around
I don't know too worried about how, can never stop us now

[Chorus]
If birds fly, so can I
I got a heartbreak dawn rising in my sky
It's so beautiful, I just might cry
Watching birds fly

[Verse 2]
Go on, ask me do I love you?
I'll say ""the sun shines""
Ask me, and I'll tell you
""You know I can't lie""

[Pre-Chorus]

It just looks like Venus on Mars, let's make this universe ours
Gravity's holding us down so let's turn this planet around

If birds fly, so can I
I got a heartbreak dawn rising in my sky
It's so beautiful, I just might cry
Watching birds fly
If birds fly, so can I
I got a heartbreak dawn rising in my sky
It's so beautiful, I just might cry
Watching birds fly

Fly, fly, fly, fly
Just might cry watching them fly
Fly, fly, fly, fly
While I touch the sky
Fly, fly, fly, fly
While I touch the sky
Fly, fly, fly, fly

[Chorus]
If birds fly, so can I
I got a heartbreak dawn rising in my sky
It's so beautiful, I just might cry
Watching birds fly

Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
'Til next year?

God, I can’t do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door

Me quilla cuando una me dice que hablemos
Es que voy a toa' y no piso lo freno

Finny Music

[Intro 2: DJ Paul]
Who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it
Who run it, who run it

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
These niggas got plenty Anna but they ain't got plenty guns
I'm bustin' out luxury cars, still got these hoes on the run
I'm hearin' plenty mean words, but ain't no actions to boot
We can do some straight war for war, we can do some stickin' and movin'
We can meet in the middle of these streets or in the middle of this ring
I can pop your chest, plastic Glock, or pop your jaw diamond rings
Bitch don't hate me hate the bank, for stacks of cheese that I take
Or hate my shiny wristband, and big ass rims I rotate
See people flip when I'm comin', got suckas sick at the stomach
They wonderin' what I brought in, they wonderin' what I got comin'
Niggas I'm comin' like this, off in your mouth like a bitch
Trust me when you think of me, I'm bringing water, I'll start it

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
What's the business?
It's that player that you love to hate, always see come out the bank
Always have to mention my name, when you high on that drank
Catch up with this boy you can't, cause you know I'm holdin' rank
When you see the platinum Rolex with the ice it make you faint
Through the streets now have you heard, 'bout the Mafia droppin' birds
Runnin' from the narcs and cops, tossin' out the bags of herb
Ain't afraid to pop the steel, hollow tips to make you feel
If you wanna punk me out, Cartier's and a Dracula grill

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
I can't take anymore, I'm 'bout to explode
I'm 'bout to overload, I'm 'bout to get it, boy
All I wanna know is where the G's at, where the key's at
Keep it easy, you don't want to get skeeted
All on this motherfuckin' room, nigga, boom
Lay down on your back so you can get up soon
Stab you in your heart with a har-fuckin-poon
Nigga, boom, nigga, boom

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow's on it, I'm still hungry, starvin' for a platinum supper
Wipe it easy, some black founded, crooked ass set'll be eating rubber
'Cause if they skit-skat, gun 'em all down, even ghost towns
Splish-Splash, brains on the ground, with a cannon round
Ball bat, bash him in his back, beatin' bitches down
Battleaxe blaze from the cross, body never found
Catch a close encounter cause the Anna kills off these rap bums
Chemical reaction cobra venom shot into his arm

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These...
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 5: Gangsta Boo]
Here we go, all you weak ass hoes
In my face like you my friend
Triple Six dropped in again, time to make ends
Dope game, my game, hoes lame, it's a shame
How that Gangsta Boo is runnin' the click up on you bitches man
Fat cat, what I be, packin', how you love that
Fuck a platinum plaque, gimme money, where the dollars at
(Blap, blap) You're dead in a second for 10 G's
(Where you from?) Black haven is where I be on my P's and Q's

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Parents please, watch out for your children
This the one that'll lock 'em in the basement
Some of them talkin' so rugged, some corrupted ugly pussa-pussa
Close your fucking mouth, my nigga, Koopsta tryin' to tell ya somethin'
Peter-Peter, pussy eater, one of them fucked by Koopsta Knicca
Lord, I done some sins, cause she married, but I don't know that nigga
Figured he is a killa, so he figures he'll watch us fuckin'
Put them muthafuckin' slugs upside that thug, cuz, oh my

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, the-these, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 7: Juicy J & DJ Paul]
For that dick game, wouldn't buy your bitch with my loose change
Thirsty niggas eatin' bitches ass with the shit stain
Insane like my motherfuckin' wrist game, nigga
Houses on the hill cost the same fuckin' thing
Counted up a hunnid this mornin'
Then I went spent me 50
Then I hit the VLive, tryna buy me some ass and titties
Rappers sample my old shit, keep runnin' 'em bags, I'm uh rich
Get 'em samples cleared 'cause that publish you might not get some
Niggas act like they don't owe me somethin'
I'm the reason bitches twerkin' they ass, now show me somethin'
Payin' homage is a real nigga move, bitch I paid my dues
Sold a million out the trunk, you niggas uber poo
Pour that mud up like that butter, first nigga with that pipe in the club
Used to have to turn my shit up, had niggas tryna fight in the club
Y'all leaving with them, we hit them hoes right in the club
And I know I'm icy'd up, pinky just like that dub
You gotta like my shit, you a hater or somethin'
I'm a grown ass man, you a baby or somethin'
Probably fucked yo mama on the come up in the 80's, homie
Don't you ever try to play me, homie
Got a wife now like Kanye
And I wish a bitch would try to bite her like Beyonce
My daughter 2 months and she been paid
Boutta sign more deals, cop more real estate
Me and Pat used to rob for 'em petty things
Now it's nothin' less than private jets, 7 figure checks
Hater, catch yo fuckin' breathe, you broke, ain't got nothin' left
We them niggas in Dubai from the north, don't you ever flex
Mafia, runnin' shit, Juicy J ain't never quit
Ain't a bitch I never hit, still countin' paper, bitch
When the smoke clears, nigga, I'm still here
Higher than I been in 20 goddamn years, uh
Motherfuckin' legend get your smoke right, dope right (Who run it)
Ain't no conversation for that broke life, show right,  (Who run it) bitch

[Verse 8: CupcakKe & DJ Paul]
Let me talk my shit real quick (Who run it), all the real niggas gon' feel this
How that's yo' kid but he ain't got bills? Can't find you in family pics
Food stamps, they go so quick when you up in a family of six
So it's funny how they sell that shit for a little pack of weed and a new pair of kicks
Man, I'm so dead, I can't, inside I feel so blank
Little girls on Twitter talkin' 'bout they break up, girl, sit back on Paint
If I'm alive, no complaints, none of these judges saints
Let the black beat her, that's 10 years, but if white beat her, ""nice tank""
It's so ridiculous, ain't shit funny, ain't ticklish
Don't test me if I'm with the shits, end up in a cage, no Nicholas
Everything about me is interesting, I'ma need more and more Benjamins
Damn, I can't breathe, stop smoking them trees, got your insides looking like Christmas
Ungrateful hoes, get the fuck out of here, you had a rough day and I had a rough year
So when I get money I really do care, go and invest it, not spending on gear
Think about that, just stating facts, niggas don't chart when it's real rap
Earn my respect then you get it right back, that go hand in hand ain't talkin' dap
A lot of issues in my past still hurt me to this day, to the core
I don't ever open up 'cause I know people change like the oil
Over 100k up on tour, still got a mindset like I'm poor
But I'm on the roll when it come to rappin' like a pack of aluminum foil
Man, I love walking barefoot, I really like the feel when I'm at the bottom (what?)
'Cause I know it's only for a couple of seconds, then I'm right back to my stardom (that's right)
Motherfuckers ain't woke, man, I gotta fuck around and re-alarm 'em
I'm woke all day, 3 AM, when they call me Jake from State Farm
Okay, lil' bitch, act like you know, anything I say is right like nose
Walk right over there, hoe, like roach, and it's over for these hoes, no dose
Walk in that bitch with a white T, they don't really like me but you know how that goes
Walk out that bitch you would think I'm little red riding hood, how I got blood on my clothes

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 9: G Herbo]
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, ""Gang-gang first,"" you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
""Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried""
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young to sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, not one day, your honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to Bali, get a brib, I’m ballin
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, ""Fuck it, no problem, it'll do""
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)
I seen ten niggas get killed
What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh)
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?

[Interlude: G Herbo]
Uh, who run it? Limit
No Limit run it
No Limit man
No Limit
Who run it? G Herbo
I'm done with this shit

[Verse 10: Lil Uzi Vert]
Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me
Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'
This bust down, tryna scare us or some'
Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'
What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'
Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'
Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'
Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'
Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch
You think I'ma miss that?
Man she sucked Meen's dick and she sucked Rock's dick
So you think I'ma kiss that?
I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose
Told her I ain't with that
Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck
Mean you better give your wrist back
Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at
Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that
Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh
I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch (facts)
Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out
Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back
Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat
Car so foreign got an engine in the back
Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada
With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched
Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy
In Chiraq, 150, be strapped
Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back
Gun loud, backyard party, kick back
How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?
Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats
Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks
After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax
Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island
You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing
Said, ""Elliot, bezel it,"" ice kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains
Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion
On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'
You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'
She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'
I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

I'm on Percocet's, I think I'm finna skydive (yeah)
You little pussycat, you must think you got nine lives (21)
I'm so sick of all this fruity shit, you niggas on thin ice
That stick gon' cut you half-time, now these niggas wanna switch sides (straight up)
I ain't really with that takin' shit, lil' nigga, I'm walkin' up (straight up)

Broad day, I'll see food, had to hit a lick at Kiku (yeah-yeah)
Lil' bitch I don't need you (yeah-yeah)
Hell Nah, I can't eat you (yeah-yeah)
Let the whole gang G you, then I left that bitch at Jeju (yeah-yeah)
You must be scared or some, nigga, let's bet the spread or some (21)
That's your main bitch, but I bet that lil' bitch spread for some (on God)
I got all these blues like I ain't bangin' red or somethin' (trre)
I bought all these cars like l ain't got no legs or somethin' (yeah)
Fuck that other side, pull up in ya hood switch it (21)
Sex, money, murder, two guns, nigga, big B's (21)
Every time I hit that bitch she come back like a frisbee (yeah)
I ain't got time to play with nobody kids, go watch Disney (yeah)
Skin made of concrete, nigga, you can never be me (21)
My brother down the road with a touchscreen and a FeFe (BF)
Candlelight gang, leave a nigga on the TV (21)
Fish fry gang, y'all can't even afford to die
Bitch, I'm way too real, I can't even afford to lie

[Verse 12: A$AP Rocky]
Make a bitch wanna stare or something
Niggas stare, you queer or somethin'?
You's a bitch, yeah we stay done
Chose a whip but I'm staying sunny
Diamonds sunny like I'm Cher or something
Smiley faces with the glasses
Fashion brands invite you to Paris
Boy you late that's a demerit, dang it
Get fucking maggot brain having
Rappers claiming the trap and the fashion
They only got Louis and the trap
I'm causing the flood and the traffic
The way that you be moving is whack
All of them rumors is facts
They've been in clap for the clap back
Your baby mama a nag nag
Nag nag nag nag nag nag...

[Verse 13: Trippie Redd]
Lil' nigga let them llamas fly, leave a young nigga so traumatized
Totin' gats jit, all my niggas ride
Don't make me make another mama cry
Do a drill, catch another homicide
Fix your face, nigga, you got butterflies?
Chopper at your throat and you afraid to die
Big 14, fuck the other side
Jugg, jugg, got all this jewelry
Man, this shit ain't new to me
Your bitch new to you, she ain't new to me
I ain't really with the fucking foolery
Glistenin' in these fucking diamonds
Bad bitch and I'm fucking shining
I got a bad bitch from the fucking islands
Taking trips to the fucking islands
Guess these guys don't realize
When they talking fly, man, it's suicide
Don't talk, do a nigga do or die
Nobody else, nigga, you and I
Big chopper, I'ma let the bullets fly
That red dot right between your eyes
I don't play, pussy, wish a nigga try
'Cause that'd be the night niggas die
Niggas act like I ain't G.O.A.T. or somethin'
Take a trip, go chill with the bros or somethin'
Call a few bitches, chill with some hoes or somethin'
Niggas be flexin', they bold or somethin'
They don't want that war, go home or somethin'
Internet flexin' with the phone or somethin'
You a lil' pup, nigga, fetch a bone or somethin'
Niggas male strippers when them poles bummin'

Glock out, running we empty 12
Bitch on my dick, that's a love spell (yeah)
Bitch with the shits, call her Annabelle (yeah)

Hmm, where the hoes? Nigga, that's weird (pussy, pussy)
Cop a new Lamb, cop a new 'Rari
Just to go and switch gears (skrt)
Burn out, burn out
Every time we turn out, make a big scene (yeah)
2K, 3K, 4K, 5K, spent it on my new jeans (skrt skrt skrt)
Gave big bro twenty-seven racks for his birthday, the world made a scene (facts)
Y'all don't even know how a nigga live
Spend twenty racks like two bands (facts)
Uh, came with the sticks like they hunting nigga
Throwing gang signs, call it taunting nigga
Can't nobody at QC get punked, nigga
What is a one-on-one, nigga? We jumpin' niggas
We got the strap, nigga, fuck it, we stompin' niggas
I'm just as rich as your favorite rapper, nigga, might be richer (yeah)
Hit the pent like I'm Derek Fisher
Fuck the bitch right, then I kiss her
Ride around town, you the one who licked her (ew)
Ha, real player like my pops (pops)
Thirty round in my Glock (doot-doot-doot)

Ten toes on my sole, niggas wouldn't double dare to cross the big Boat (yeah)
Last year

[Chorus: DJ Paul]

[Verse 15: Tutweezy]

[Verse 16: Young M.A.]
Twenty racks in the back of jeans
Tatted sleeves, Patek freeze
Pretty nigga, that indeed
Thottie with me, black and cream
African, Japanese
I just call her blackanese
I'm just gonna tap that and leave
I don't leave the house unless I got a bag waitin' for me at the front door
If you short on my cash, thirty niggas hoppin' out a Uber truck
So don't try your luck, hoes down to fuck
Top floor of the hotel
Smokin' weed in the bathroom, put the shower on so it's no smell
Street cold, don't tell
But I'd rather live where it's no hell
It's funny how hatin' niggas be the ones who names ring no bells
Oh well, my bitch bad
And her pussy got a soap smell
She a model, nah she a model
She a little bougie
And I'm just tryna put this big wet tongue on top of that coochie
Earlier she a little mad at me, she a little moody
Sometimes I don't understand the bitch, she a little confusing
Like half the time I don't be even doin' shit, and she be assuming
Like I ain't loyal or somethin'
You act like I don't call you or somethin'
You act like you a little spoiled or somethin'
Is you hot like you boiling somethin'?
So all you rappers it's a rap for you like aluminum foil or somethin'
Better crown her, came from the ground up, from the soil or somethin'
Been 'bout it, every nigga with me poppin' like oil or somethin'
I was slackin', had to get on track like I'm recordin' or somethin'
I hear a lot of talk, but honestly they ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin'
And nowadays I don't trust a thing, so I ain't really sure about nothin'
I just fucked your bitch in Givenchy flip flops
And yeah we spendin' money, but we also spin blocks
Bend blocks, shout out my nigga Jezz, big opps
They ain't open up them doors, I had to pick locks
Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free the whole 9
Got lit on my own nigga, didn't need a cosign
It's Red Lyfe, no red lights, green lights go time
But before you get on the road, nigga make sure you know your road signs
He asked did I fuck his bitch, I said ""uh yeah nigga, four times""
My sex drive longer than my show lines, make her cum in no time
RL that's the bro sign, can't come in, we got closed sign
Can't hang here, this is not a clothesline
Fuck around and get clotheslined
No ghostwriter, I wrote mine
Wrote the whole rap and the whole rhyme
They like ""MA, where the album at?""
I just need a lil' more time
I got guns, but if I ain't usin' it, no need to show mine
Don't mean I won't blow, ma
Bitch nigga, you could blow, ma
In the club I drink out the bottle, ain't no need to even pour mine
Stripper bitches don't like me 'cause I get money and don't throw mine
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me, ain't gotta say it, you already know why
If I had a dick, you could suck it
If I had nuts, you could hold mine

[Refrain: Young M.A.]
I said, if I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Haha
If I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Fuck y'all niggas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: DJ Paul]

[Verse 17: Bhad Bhabie]
Ayy
When I look around, don't see nobody in my lane
See these rappers need the clout, that's why they always say my name
I'm only gettin' better, bitter bitch it ain't gon' change
Why you tryna hang around me, bitch, get off 'cause you ain't gang
You ain't gang, treat you like a stain
All my biz is straight, I'd still be good without the fame
I got so many cousins, aunts, uncles that I never knew
On me for my revenue, I'm big now like I'm 7'2""
New whip and my leather smooth, try me, I'ma play it cool
Windows down, AC blowin', 20 below, I'm extra cool
You lookin' fed up 'cause of my bread up, I keep my head to the sky
Run up, [?] and I'm back to [?] where I'm droppin' the fire
Who want it? Tell me, bitches, who blunted?
You ain't know my crew run it? All we see is blue hundreds
On my dash, 200, these bitches sad and can't run it
Ho I'm a star, you wanna walkthrough you better tell me who fundin'

[Verse 18: Crank Lucas]

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

[Verse 19: Chevy Woods & Wiz Khalifa]
Ay bitch, this a brand new chain
Put her in Vera Wang
She got a crazy top
I let her go insane
G-shit in my veins
Limited seats on my plane
Get to the country they know my name
I could pay for anything I'm ordering
Whether it's bitches, California weed, fourth down
Got 20 inches
I'm rolling up hella green by the pound
You wanna pinch this
Wondering what the stench is
Always played my position
We balling cause we the realest
...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

[Verse 20: Roy Purdy]
Just make sure to always stay true to who you are"", and I did that
Jeans black with a pink hat
Sorry, I don't wanna come to ya kickback
Oh no, so cold like Frozone
9-2-0, what I rep, that's home
Big racks, big facts, no foolery
Got 'em like ""God damn, man, who is he?""
It's me, ya boy Roy so crispy
Really had to go and hit 'em with the quick speed
Too fast, look left, look right
You ain't gon' see nothin' like me in sight
Hit my dance real quick, ouu, I just might
Wanna sleep on me? Okay, good night
I'm gone, new song comin' soon
Ya boy Roy really been up in the stu'
It's nothin' new, yeah, this what I do
Been makin' music way before all the views
Whi-white T with the white vans
Oh man, god damn, I'm fresh
Kickin', laid back, life's good, no stress
I don't gotta flex, you know I'm up next
Sike, bitch, I'm up now
I'm holdin' it down
I'm feelin' great
I cannot frown
""Who Run It"" remix
Just something light
Had to snap real quick, now I'm droppin' the mic
Okay

[Verse 21: Slim Jesus]
Ayy, ayy, gang
Y'all know how the fuck I'm rockin' man
I'm hearin' a whole lot of talk about who run this shit
I be countin' stacks
Who run Ohio, that's me
Which one of y'all hotter than me?
Leave the beat like a hundred degrees
And it's still all this ice on me
Who getting plays like me?
Who getting paid like me?
Y'all was not made like me
And I put that on my G's
Remember they hated on me
I knew all I needed was cheese
Ran it up and I blew it on jeans
Had to run it back up times three
None of y'all wanna be like me
Run around with them pipes like me
Fresh pair of Off-Whites on my feet
Gold chain on a Polo white tee
In a trap with a whole lot of P's
Smoking dope 'til we Vietnamese
I threw bro lil thirty
He threw like fifty to me
All of these rappers is broke
That shit be sickening to me
You blew the whole bag on the road
You look like a victim to me
I just pulled up in a foreign
And you got a Honda on E
All black tints on all my whips
'Cause I know they're looking for me
Just know wherever I go
It's a glizzy with me right up under the seat
I give a fuck what you claiming you is
You can get touched with the heat
I remember being irrelevant
Now I get bands for all of my feats
Remember totin' tourists
Now we got AR's that's chopping down trees
It's a fifty on bro and a thirty on me
You don't really really want the beef
You can talk that shit on the internet
Run up, get done up, get wrapped up in sheets
They was talking crazy last night
'Til a hundred shots hit they block
I don't even know who got hit with that shit
But we smoking all opps
Everywhere I go I'm with the gang
It's at least three or four of them Glocks
If you speaking on who run it, ain't say my name, you smoking on rocks
I'm in the street like fuck 12, bitch I'm off the Henny
You can find me with the gang 'cause I don't fuck with many
Them my brothers, if I'm busting they gon' dump it with me
They know I'm a threat and that's the reason they ain't fucking with me, gang

Niggas goin down fast like stop drop

Threw a bag at my baby mama here you go, go shopping
Every other day I'm waking up to new money
Gettin deposits in
From negative to positive
Dollar boy just landed
In the city of angels
...

[Verse 24: Idontknowjeffery]
Point me out to who run it
Fuckin' man or a woman
I kick they ass in the stomach until they vomit from it
Nigga I'm sick I'm bubonic and you and that bitch is platonic
Stab your ass in the stomach and clean the mess up with Comet
Fuck all that extra shit
I'm in the bed with a naked bitch and her head just twist like damn exorcist
What ya tryna posses me with
The way she suck my dick was an accident cause I ain't even have to ask the bitch
Nigga I'm stingy as hell
I'm face my hoes nigga I don't even pass the bitch
And I shit on niggas on accident like I ate some laxatives
Try to impress me with that bullshit turn him to an acronym
Nigga its Prick Harper
I'm a shit starter
And all that bullshit you talkin' make my dick harder
I treat a rapper like his father I don't text him I don't call him
I don't bother
Nigga I let the Glock solve problems

[Verse 25: Xavier Wulf]
These rappers ain't runnin' shit but ya bitch
Who, where she at?
She at the crib tryna cook me something every damn day
Told her ""bitch I do it better"" by myself go move away
Here to stay
Up from now until whenever the fuck I say
...
Well I could I ain't never had a juug but I had a blunt to finish
You rap niggas still capping

[Verse 27: Jeremih]
Lil' mama give me head 'til I'm dead, I call it brainstormin'
You ain't even halfway 'Yonce, I could put a ring on it
Pop, country, rap, trap, punk, rock, I could still sing on it
On the block wit' niggas big as Shaq but I could still hang on it
3 story, no story, no Tory, this a different lane on 'em
Lane to lane, white ghost, red gust, that's a candy cane, homie
Everybody wanna be the king but who gon' make the claim for it
I'ma say me for the moment
[?]
So [?], I ain't scared or nothin'
Chicago made me a bear or somethin'
I just skydive, I'm so live, you could catch me comin' out the air or somethin'
Lost some niggas gettin' this money, still got a pocket full of dead homies
Got a bad bitch wit' a head on her
Versace robe, two bands for it
It's God's plan, I ain't playin' for it
I'm just tryna be the landlord
I came to fuck up the buildin'
Hitman, I'm gon' make a killin'
I'm used to shoppin' at Sears, now I be shoppin' wit Siri
Used to be stealin' cologne, now I be stealin' your bitches

[Bridge]
Yeah
Nah mean?
[?]
[?] slow it down, you know?
Go the other way on 'em

[Verse 28: Jeremih]
Yeah
Pull up to the Valley, car got no keys
Diamond pinky ring cost a low key
Make a play [?], you should proceed
Big ballin', put the money on the flo' seats
Bank account always doin' backflips
Used to have the walls and the matress
Numbers still the same since the old me
Don't get it fucked up, I ain't the old me
Who run it? Now who run it?
My pockets on cucumber
I'ma have yo' girl over
Have her speakin' boonomics
Got the Kevin Gates, I got that two phones, I got two numbers
Ain't talking YouTube numbers
I could take a few summers

1: Cause I fuckin' am

[Verse 33: Dax]
Had to come here and enlighten
Had to come give you the facts, trapping is wack
You might get a stack
Your daughter at home, your mama still crying
Blacks in America dying
Trump in office, he wildin'
Droppin these bars for fun, we going to war
But look at the timing, buying
They put me in chains, confined me
I'm rapping the real but can't get a deal
These niggas is not replying
Why the system be falsifying?
They say that I might be crazy
They say that my shit too real
The reason that they cannot play me
Industry cannot detain me
A cross of Pac and Baby
I've been to hell and back, that's why they say they cannot save me
Ain't poppin' no pills, I stay in the field
These niggas is fakes, they mad that I'm real
I see that you broke, don't know how that feel
You gave up your life by signin' a deal
Might shout out to Kaep for taking a kneel
Might shout out to Jag for rappin the real
My bars is guns, they can't conceal
These niggas dumb
Not a rapper, I be in my own division
Save the world by 2020, nigga I be on a mission
I just started and I'm right exactly where I had envisioned
Niggas blind, that's why I rap, to clear their motherfucking vision
Fucking on the game
Fucking on you bitches who've been fucking for the fame
I've be getting rich and dodging niggas who ain't changed
Tried to tell my shooters, had to read [?] out the chain
With a bitty lil name, lil nigga you ain't gang
You not, circle small, like a dot
Keep it tight 'cause people like to come and try and make you fall
I've seen it all, it's fine
They'll try and stop your shine
They snakes, still smile up in your face but talk that shit behind, behind
I seen it all baby, watch out for these snakes in the grass
They sayin' just enough to your face to keep you happy
That way in case you do make it, they can say they been there
Ayy DJ cut the beat, cut the beat

[Bridge: Dax]
Hip hop is not dead and never left
It's just a book collectin' dust I found on the shelf
I don't care if you wanna read it or anybody else
'Cause I'll turn myself to Jesus and resurrect it myself

[Verse 34: 6ix9ine]
Yo, I usually don't do this
But you know what I'm saying
Had to come body bag this one time
Niggas really thought I was in jail or something
Momma didn't raise no hoe or something
I was really in the store bought a Snickers or something
I - I was trapping in the-in the way back and I got that
And I flip that and I really get that
But I told my mom ""I don't do that!""
But she was really there
And I told her that ""Yeah, I'm coming in,""
But she was like, ""Nah, don't come near""
And I was like, ""GED""
And I said, ""I flip that, really get that""
I whip that and I hit that and I-yeah
LA see you next week, Coachella I'm here today
But fuck that we here and we live wit' TR3YWAY
Fuck that umm
Cut it

[Verse 35: Futuristic]

[Verse 36: BlocBoy JB]
Pulled up with that stick, hey, nigga don't miss
Got your bitch, she on her knees, she gon' eat the dick
Smoking strong, that Hercules, you can't tell me shit
Thirty-four ounces of Barkley, Phoenix versus Knicks
Walk in this bitch with my stack out
Please don't run, I got the MAC out
This nigga just made me blackout
I'm 'bout to box him like Pacquiao (doon-doon-doon)
Kurt Angle, I'm making her tap out
Started by pulling them tracks out
This shit is facts now, you can get whacked now
Watch in your face, tell me how you gon' act now, bitch
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo
Riding with my motherfuckin' dogs, bruh
You ain't got no money, I can't call you
Put two up in your back, John Wall you
All this purple on me homie, I'm a baller
Crip, crip, crip, crip, crip, crip crip crip
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
East side, east side, east side nigga that's C side
Who up on my side nigga, you know I'ma ride
If you play with my side, bitch it's homicide
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo (crip)

[Chorus: DJ Paul]

[Verse 37: Key Glock]
I got gold gold on my throat, diamonds in my teeth (ice)
Clarity, clarity, clarity, clarity, all this ice on me (ice)
Got this bad bitch with blonde hair, I call her Russian Cream
And I got that baby chopper, I'll rock your ass to sleep
Can't stand me, take a seat (ho), designer head to feet, yeah
Everything on fleek, Cartier on me, yeah
I dress like a geek, yeah, boy your swag is weak, yeah
That shit is so cheap, yeah, my shit overseas, yeah
I'm fly like a butterfly and I sting like a bee, yeah
Call me Glock Ali, yeah, diamonds fighting like Tina
Turner, bitch I turn up, Royal Rumble
Thirty niggas with me and you know they ready to burn you
Knuck if you buck, run up and you get done up
No I'm not from Louisville, but bitch I keep my slugger
Straight up out the jungle, ain't no talk or tussle
Got no time to scuffle, I'm 'bout my chips like Ruffles
Workin like a butler, ain't no more struggle
Tell these niggas catch up, tennis chains mustard
Ran up my racks, run and tell that
Ran through a bag and got that shit right back
These niggas ain't doing shit, these niggas ain't talkin' jack
You niggas ain't running shit, this chopper make you run a lap
Yeah
Glizzock

[Verse 38: Ballout]
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
I'm in a truck called SRT or somethin'
Doin' Need for Speed or somethin'
Hundred thousand my key or somethin'
Two hundred my Jeep or somethin'
Niggas broke as hell actin' like they don't know how to eat or somethin'
Miami Beach Louis sandals, know I got my heat or somethin'
At the condo, you can't get in unless you got a key or somethin'
Smokin' out the 440 and it smoke a P or somethin'
Took the doors off, ridin' through Cali in my Jeep stuntin'
Long as they print money it's gon' keep comin'
I know you hear my Jeep runnin'
I ain't pumpin' gas, they gon' keep pumpin'
Ride through the hood and they keep honkin'
People look at me and they see money
I'm a boss, d-money
Load em' people up, my phone gon' keep jumpin'
They like ""Ball, is it weed or is it d-money?""
Bankroll like street money
Walk in Neiman's, leave the Hellcat and the Jeep runnin

[Verse 39: Chief Keef]
My bitch said she gon' leave me like she complete somethin'
Bitch, you [?] met you at 2:30 and fucked your ass at 3 somethin'
Who you run up on? Not us
I'ma take my own heat, shoot three or somethin'
Might be in the trap, call Jeep or somethin'
Might get Ball with a whole P or somethin'
Might be in SRT or somethin'
Krispy might make a bitch cream or somethin'
Cross that red line, get a beam or somethin'
Wake you up like you had a bad dream or somethin'
Who, Chief Sosa think he Rambo?
I was in the field with the lizard
Doing spinouts since the blizzard
Like Snoop Dogg ""What's the wiz-zard?""
Disappear on that bitch like a wizard
And I'm cuttin' real sharp like a scissor
Roll by so fast, Big Dipper
I'm in LA more than a Clipper
Balenciaga more than a owner
Bitch, we out here more than a corner
Smoke way more dope than a stoner
And I drink way more than Homer
I can see like Christopher Columbus
Juiceman, the trap house bunkin'
You niggas ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
King Sosa don't care about nothin'
F on my shirt, on my feet double Gs
Start gettin' F's in sixth grade, couldn't even get a couple B's
All for my habit, whats the fee? A couple G's
Aye lil' bitch, these Moncler, no need to buckle these
Aye lil' baby, these not me, no need to upload these
And when you hear that [?], bitch that's me up your street
And just make you think about when they put that thing up your teeth
Lil' nigga said up yo chest talkin' to me, up your speech

[Verse 40: Chief Keef & Ballout]
Pullin' off from Neiman's doin' donuts in the Jeep
Track [?] Look like Black Hawk flying out the street
Hopped out for twenty minutes for a backend
Seen your girlfriends tryna get back in
Hopped in the Hellcat, had to put the track in
Ball, you got the blues, why the fuck you blackin'?
Ball, you can rap, why you steady trappin'?
'Cause I get it for the L-O like Shawty nigga, tap in
Sosa, why you pay a thousand for that headband?
Because Ben Franklin is a dead man
Any time you see me, wonder that's that bread man
If he step in front his gun, then that's a brave man

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 41: Moneybagg Yo]
Pink and purple in my cup, I'm Lil Pump-in'
Trap jumpin' (like what, like what?)
Like some fingers, it's thumpin'
Who done it?
Pockets fat with bricks of hundreds, I'm Klump-in' (Sherman)
I run it
Headed to the top, like quickies I'm comin' (ugh ugh)
Bagg
Talkin' 'bout quickies, I'm comin'
Ugh ugh, yeah
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em
Get hit for lookin' suspicious (watch how you look)
Diamonds wet, they gon' wash the dishes
Sittin' in the coupe with the missus, Whitney
If you bad you can fuck her with me
I'm taking chances, risks (risks)
Learn how to dance, my wrist did (Breezy)
I'm like the Memphis Kendrick (Lamar)
I was broke, now I""m a rich kid (look at my shoes, watch me plug walk)
This new freezer cost right here sixty (sixty K, shout out to Icebox)
AP ring and watch Jordan Pippen (duo)
And you know I run this shit, pockets keep me limpin'
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em, yeah

[Verse 42: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa
I get trippy like three six
I just hit a bad bitch with my new bitch
I don't do Kel-Tec, FN can't miss
Souped up box Chevy came with a kill switch (kill out)
I stack bread, mister winners (stack it)
I drive a tank in the winter (kill 'em)
No L's, nigga I'm a winner
This year is not for beginners
These pair of [?] call 'em Sprinters
Seventy K for a new straight A
I'm havin' shooters, no mayday
Every day to me is more money Monday
And my neck is cold like I ate a sundae
Get up, stack the money, never switch up
A hundred for the Patty, know I stay lit up
I'm pushin' for greatness but I don't do sit-ups
And I love a bitch that can get my dick up
I been quiet but I can really start a riot
You can get it grilled or fried
Your favorite rapper be cappin' with lies
I call it burnt out and tied, therefore we don't have ties
Water on me, submarine
Break the pot, I cook up clean
What's the blue strip without greens
When it comes [?] I'm the king
I say I'm too blunt, I'm not mean
Good game from an old head, call him Sega
Ice talk crazy on the Razr
I keep it player, new crib got layers
It ain't 'bout paper, I'll talk to you later
I give you pimpin', but I stay drippin'
You small like a wiz then I ball like I'm Pippen
You be slippin', they call you Tristan
You tell the tea so I named you Lipton
Hundred bows, kicked a hundred doors
They cash me out then I bring a hundred more
New Rari came with Lambo doors
House in Berlin came with three stoves
She ride the dick, no Rodeo Drive
Hit you with a combo, you get two sides
Black excellence, I'm excellent
I bought the block back for the Nobel Prize
Pink slip shawty right now 'cause I'm on
You pop big shit now then it's on
Think smart, first get a call then a home
You don't need a loan, get a zone, get it gone
I'm on my ten flip now, get your own
AP two-tone freeze, honeycomb
I'm lightskinned, call me Kev Combs
And I get money, badda-bing badda-bom
I could count a whole hundred in your face
I got air, fuck a pair of human race
Walk in safe, look like a Chase
Dipped out my safe and it turned to a chase
You tryna be me, I bet you gon' fail
Big checks comin', now I check the mail
I'm thinkin' money, blue or green hundreds
House in the hills, it look like a whale's (whoa)
I could say somethin' but it ain't the time
It ain't on me if ain't mine, eliminate me with a lime
I got heart of a lion, if I said they ain't bitin' I'd be lyin'
Lowkey in a low-rider, I write mines, no ghostwriter
I be leanin' and lookin' for the new Spider
I'm on fire and my chains firefighter (Flippa)

[Verse 43: Cdot Honcho]
I paid a G for my sneakers bitch
These ain’t no regular Adidas, hah
Have fo'nem parked outside your shit
Like your shit an arena
I’m up on Hollywood Boulevard
Fo'nem with me, not a bodyguard
Try it, you know they be choppin' shit
Might turn this bitch to a lumberyard
I was the first one in SRT
And I drove that bitch like a bumper car
I got your bitch up on DVD
Ain’t got a heart, need another heart
Roc, he'll circle around your block
On point like he really can’t find a park
Pop out you only gon' see a spark
Police said they only seen a dart
I got ten K in my joggers, ayy
You don’t want problems
Five on your head, niggas gon' pop out your closet
Smokin' biscotti, too much gelato
Feel like I’m sitting on a rocket
Ain’t no more space in my pockets
Ain’t no more space in my closet either
I just be thinking 'bout profit
I'm in the coupe with a mamacita
She only good for the noggin
That bitch know she got a mouth on her
She eat me up then I’m out on her
No we don’t play with the police games
She know we put a route on her
Look I ain't shit, with another one
Nothing was given l ran it up, bitch

[Verse 44: Sauce Walka]
If I really want his body I'ma sleep in the grass
If I get my hands dirty I'ma wash 'em in gas
Get that gunpowder off me, roll a wood up, and laugh
'cause I'm really 'bout that murder, I'll smoke your ass
Pay a bitch to wrap you with a cord and choke your ass nigga
Yeah I could get on some evil shit
Rip out your heart like a demon shit
Send body parts to your people shit
Yeah I send your hands to your mama
I send your legs to your daddy
I send your eyes to your granny
I send your foot to your daughter
Fuck it, the label some horror
Fuck it, the label some saw
Granny playin' guitar, 'cause you ain't never ever comin' back no more
I got guns when it comes to the store
I got guns that you niggas can't order
I got guns that you never can borrow
I got guns that can still shoot good underwater
I got guns that can shoot through brick walls, I got guns that got night vision
I got guns that shoot hand grenades, I got handguns that hold fifty
I got guns with long barrels on 'em, look so ugly, shoot so pretty
I got guns in my bitch titties, moral is don't fuck with me
If it's an issue we see him 'bout it, if it's an issue we be about it
It ain't a question if we about it, it ain't a question if we about it
Master P, yeah I'm 'bout it 'bout it
'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it
Ran up him with a shotty, ran up on him with a shotgun
Make him jump like a pop gun, let both kids play with pop guns
Like a needle I'ma pop somethin', like a football I'ma drop somethin'
Ooh-wee
Who done it? who done it?
Who done it? who done it? nigga
The kid done did, one and done nigga
Sorry for the Sauce 3
Who done it? who done it? me

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (word, word, word)
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I lied (hah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat
I'm not the same, man, and I could let you check the tag now
I'm rockin' name brand, I'm only chasin' after bags now
I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]

Nigga, this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied
I ain't got no fucking job, this my life, this my, wait—

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
All of y'all wishy and washy
All y'all my kids in a car seat
I take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi
Lyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands, I think I need to find you a hobby
God got a plan, hope that God hold your hand, I think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!
Tell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit and I'm coming back to get even
I went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region, I let off this mac for no reason
You are now witnessing greatness, I'm practically preaching and this is the passion of Jesus
And all you basic motherfuckas are lacking achievement, and I've just been laughing and geekin'
Back to business, I got mad intentions, I ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions
But it's competition, I'm a savage winning
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician
I don't see you niggas, I've been lacking vision
You've been acting different, I've been acting distant
I'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention
You gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!
This is uncomfortable, you just keep putting your feet in a fire
I think my gun got a crush on you, boy, you 'bout to meet your secret admirer
How you do shit you don't wanna do? I do that shit just to keep me inspired
I used to hit it and leave when I wanted to, now I hit it and be sleepin' inside her, woo
Roll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em, put that motherfucking smoke up on 'em with that holy water
Joyner Lucas, I'm a holy mona leader motor runnin'
Man, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it
Prayed about it to the Lord about it in the morning, but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out
I ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down
Don't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]

[Verse 3: Rocky Badd]
Ayy, ayy
Look who I'm around man
A couple people switched, that's why you don't see 'em round man
Four four down man, know that that's a man down
I make bitches stand down then make them put they heads down
Only time you sendin' shots is when you sneak dissin'
Only time I'm on the block is when the bitches send chicken
I ain't trippin' on that nigga, he don't call unless it's business
I ain't trippin' on these bitches, once they eat they in they feelings
I ain't trippin' on no rapper that can't fight but in my business
Get to trippin' on that rapper, if she start I gotta finish
And if you fuck your niggas you can't call them boys your killers
'Cause they playin' with your feelings, mines ain't playin' with these niggas, haha
And I got shit they want but the shit they cannot buy
Bitches brazy on they Live but they barely go outside
I seen pussy in they eyes, I said fuck it, let' em slide
Told 'em I won't text these bitches, I just ho 'em, but I lied
I don't know why bitches tryin' while they funds lookin' tied
I can't trip because they lyin', let 'em take it up with God
These bitches plan winning, we gon' see how hard they grind
'Cause I push these bitches back every time I spit a line, haha

Barely spoken since graduation
To be honest I'm just afraid that
They wrote me off and they think I'm a failure

Afraid to be me
I feel it in my heartbeat, every bone
Together with you I'll always be home
My head is like a ghost town, screaming loud at me

We're so wonderful
Wonderful
Wonderful together
With you I'm beautiful
Glorious again
When we're together

218,23320,Alive,Wasback,"[Verse 1]
From riding through the city and thinking the city lit now
To controlling conversations every time we have a sit down
Over thinkers, go getters and fine women I’m with now
Fresh tailored suits the only time I’m feeling pinned down
Yea, I’m finally being who I thought I was
All it took was doing all the work I thought I was
And I don’t got a past I’m in denial of
Speak on it in reminiscent manners, that’s the cycle of
Getting people to understand and feel the same
From one pair of shoes, couple shirts to some diamond rings
And ya past ain’t nothing to make you feel ashamed
I’d rather die with pride than to die with diamond rings
Shit, well I guess Vondo gon’ die with both
I’m with some high niggas, but we got higher hopes
I’m focused on the price and focused on the growth
Remember what I said or the scent of my cologne

[Chorus]
Am I wrong for setting personal shit aside
To complete the shit I set for me before I die
Uh, moving like a deal and I ain’t even signed
If it’s a dime then it’s mine, I put 10 aside
You better speak a true game cause I could tell a lie
Next decade I’m in top 3s remaining 5s
I put my soul in it, they won’t take it out alive
I’m busy making a killing they won’t make it out alive (For real)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I miss them sessions back at UJ’s
Back when laying one verse would take me nearly two days
Been so focused I ain’t see my momma in a few days
Times likes that make wish that I was back in school days
Me and pops ain’t speaking but they tell me that we are the same
Momma hate him but she love the man that her son became
Raised by the players, so I’m never victim to the game
Poppa was a rolling stone, a steady rock what I became
Yea, I really wish I wasn’t shy at first
Miah always spit in Nanna car, he was the rapper first
Kayla showed that we could always love no matter how we hurt
I just wish we never separated and we ain’t disperse
A childhood went and made a man
Bri went and sold the ring I put up on her hand
Love comes with a price and now I understand
The life I live’s the life I promised and the life that I had planned

[Chorus]
Am I wrong for setting personal shit aside
To complete the shit I set for me before I die
Uh, moving like a deal and I ain’t even signed
If it’s a dime then it’s mine, I put 10 aside
You better speak a true game cause I could tell a lie
Next decade I’m in top 3s remaining 5s
I put my soul in it, they won’t take it out alive
I’m busy making a killing they won’t make it out alive (for real)

Fake rappers man they never speak truly
Lyin' in my circle like an MGM movie
Other spitters stupid if they dare coming closer
I'm in the frame of mind to hang squares like a poster
Burn down every studio I record at
My shows are so sick, I'm my own support act
Then I get so lonely that I undo my belt
And Airdrop pictures of my penis to myself
Kill a motherfucker when I grab that mic
When I'm in a battle I'mma snap and strike
My manner on the DnB lit
Manner man are rapping in shit, yeah
Steppin' against me's mental
'Cause I will draw quick lead: mechanical pencil
Shoot a rapper, that's highly likely
Tick me off I just do it: Nike
Uh, yeah, I'm in my prime
Beautiful women devour my rhymes
Ladies love my nerd bars
Get flaps wet: bird bath
Your girl said: ''Touch my double Ds''
Balls in her mouth: bubble tea
I shag tens you know I'm sharp
You cum in two's: Noah's Ark
Hit 'em with a little bit of big bad flow
Beat a man at rapping and it's tic-tac-toe
When I'm on the rhythm it's prime time
When I'm in the studio I rhyme
Sweet and heavy: caramel
I'm stacking lines: parallel
Get a big revolver: carousel
And you make me sick: Taco Bell
The rave is getting hype, hoorah
So raise your cups: like a bra
My flow's lit: kinda clear
Your flow's shit: that's diarrhoea
I rode the beat: scorched this
Stable flow: horse piss
I'm really good, nice one mate
Well done like tough steak

While they hang my jersey in the hall of fame
Yeah I'm gonna be legendary

[VERSE 1 - Doms Gauge]
When it's all said and done
Label me a legend
I'm turning this obsession with music to a profession
Ever since an adolescent
I've steadily been progressin'
Now you all know I got flow like Progressive
I'm young and I'm restless
Without a soap opera
I've been taking shots at the sky no vodka
Like a home doctor I get checks to the crib
That's a joke, I'm still broke man I'm just tryna live
So I count my blessings
And know that I'm destined
Can't waste one second
So I'm back with a vengeance
And I hope you know if I said it I really meant it
Run the game 'till I sprain my achilles tendon
Bet I run these tracks
No horse races
Can't keep up probably trip on your laces
I won't dumb it down or make it more basic
I'ma paint my picture how I want to portray it
Yeah I'm gonna be Legendary

[Chorus]
Legendary
Yeah I'm gonna be legendary

While they hang my jersey in the hall of fame

[VERSE 2 - Doms Gauge]
When it's all said and done
I'ma leave a legacy behind
This music is what you will be remembering me by
Yeah I'm timeless
But they still sleeping on me
Like them kids drawing pupils on their eyelids
No class, guess I gotta wake em up
You can give it everything you have but it ain't enough
Quit it with the bullshit
Jordan in his prime I'm the MVP
Tryna be a legend in the game by 23
Legendary
Oh you mad that you secondary
Aw shit, on my boss shit need a secretary
All that hating isn't necessary
Poor taste, I got more flavor than some Ben & Jerry's
I'm sick of waiting, boy I been creating
Getting more vivid with the pictures that I'm illustrating
While your shit is fading away and disintegrating
I'll be making legendary art like Da Vinci paintings

[Chorus]
Legendary
Yeah I'm gonna be legendary

Movida was the club on the Saturday
Ya actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite songs, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes, girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home?

I wanna ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low

Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

Oh, like mannequins all draped in designers
Have we forgotten where we come from?
With bottled hopes and dreams and desires
Must have forgotten that

We got rules to break
We got risks to take
We got things to say
No one ever said
It would be okay
But we'll find a way
When there's love
And we got love

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, yeah, it's okay 'cause we got love

[Bridge]
When all is said and done
Our old flame's been and gone
Take some time to look how far we've come
Remember that we got love (Ha-ah-ah-ooh)
Yeah, it's okay 'cause we got love (We got love, yeah)
Yeah, it's okay 'cause we got love (Oh-oh)

Today I don't know who I’m trying to be
Last night I was easy, free and fun
Today I got that heavy back in me

[Verse 2]
The air is slow and fat, you can cut the heat
Smell a city's worth of bodies filling up the streets
So I just draw the curtains and make my retreat
Put the fan on high, my headphones in and scroll myself to sleep

I think they call this modern anxiety
This modern life is getting the best of me

Last night I was all wrapped up in you
Today I don't know where I’m supposed to be
Last night I got served a different view
Today it's a bit difficult to breathe

I remember when, in the summer winds
We would speed down the 405, playing The Who
With the red lights and adrenaline
We had young blood in our veins and dirt on our shoes

[Pre-Chorus]
But you sold that car the year you finished school
And I stopped wearing that faded pair of shoes
We got so wrapped up in the clouds, we fell through
Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh!

We just want to stay this young for
Every day the bills keep coming
All the bullshit we're all stuck in
Take me back to, when we'd just drive
Think it's time that we said ""Fuck it""
Red light, let's run it

I'm sitting in line, on the 405
When the same song that we'd sing is playing outside (Is playing outside)
I got the windows up but I can hear enough
For it to bring me back to the way we loved
Feeling so big, feeling sober, feeling alive

Back of the car, you start to jump on me
Like heaven, you are, just finally know me
And I, I fell in love again
And I, ain't looking for a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard for me to love you like I do
When I'm always on the road
Baby, you should know
It's hard for me to love you just to prove
I ain't jealous, let me go
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?

Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza

Feels like I'm floating too far out of reach
Floating away but there's nothing for me to see
I had a dream once but with the chance I let it go
I let myself fall for the ones that said to run
Wondering where else I could be
They tell me don’t go, but honestly
It's up to me, I'll tell myself where I wanna be

[Chorus]
And for the longest time, I’d be lying if I said I was fine
And I guess it’s almost time, I realize
That no ones gonna see you when you’re believing
Up in the clouds, I was so sure I could see it
These ages are tough and I know you could feel it
When everything’s crashing down
Crashing down

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
My day gets longer I feel like
My light gets duller I feel like
I could’ve made the choice to fix it but I let it all go
Maybe I wasn’t ready but I let it all go
It’s quick how the scene changes
A day ago we were laughing
And I look around now, where are they now
I’m back on my own again

[Chorus]
And for the longest time, I’d be lying if I said I was fine
And I guess it’s almost time, I realize
That no ones gonna see you when you’re believing
Up in the clouds, I was so sure I could see it
These ages are tough and I know you could feel it
When everything’s crashing down
Crashing down

So what if I felt all along
I wouldn’t have believed we’re all gone
We promised that day we’d never leave
But that’s what you did, did to me
So what if I felt all along

We promised that day we’d never leave
But that’s what you did, did to me

But it's still better to stumble together than falling alone
Don't fall alone

So call if you need
To hell with what we agreed
I'm sitting here by the phone
Waiting to say hello I still love you

Over and over this is some hard knock ground we've covered
But it's still better to stumble together than falling alone
Don't fall alone

If I knew just where you were
Believe me I would call you first
But you've run away and
Can't hear what I'm praying

So I'll sit here in the dark all night
And hope that girl, you'll see the light
And know that it's better to stumble together than falling alone
Don't fall alone

I can never, never, never find peace in this life

Why can't love ever touch my heart like fear does?

I’ve been feeling down lower than the ground
Tryna feel numb give me all the drugs
The pain still radiates from within
But now I have a problem drug addiction
Cause nothing changes no
Nothing changes no
(Verse 1)
Wishing I could change I just wanna die
Cause nothing stays the same no it’s all lies
I’m wishing it could stop raining from my eyes
Cause every time I think of you I just cry
Living in a world of fear I’m all alone
Trapped inside my mind but it feels like home
Cause that’s the vision I’ve been fed lately
All I wanna do is stay in bed come and save me
And now the pain is getting worse cause all my friends left me
Locked me in the dark room now they laughing through the window
You give up one pain another one comes to you though
Never will you be at true peace don't take for granted
Everything you have cause you don’t have to have it
Tragic
That's the type of life he told me I've been living
Good advice he gives me always staying driven, listen
Never lose sight of the road fuck distractions
And although right now my homes a trash can
If I stay focused one day I'll make it a mansion but
(Chorus 2)
I’ve been feeling down lower than the ground
Tryna feel numb give me all the drugs
The pain still radiates from within
But now I have a problem drug addiction
But you can change it oh
You can change it oh
Yea
(Verse 2)
I know you feeling pain
Like this marks become a stain
You thinking to yourself does the pain go or stay
You put a cover-up and you always stow away
All the things you really feel that’s not the right way
To stop the cut from bleeding you have to show your true feelings
Make the best of bad moments and you’ll see a big improvement
I struggled with it myself I'll break down the good solution
Those who lie and steal cut them off because they toxic
Don’t try to keep them in your life by cheating good logic
I been through this a lot lately, yea I know it hurts
Don't argue if it's your fault maybe it wasn't supposed to work
One key thing I've learned is not every door can be opened
And if your getting hurt maybe the right thing is to close it
I know that it is dark and I know that it is painful
Open up your heart and the biggest brightest rainbow will appear
Can you wait though? Cause
(Chorus 3)
I know you feeling down lower than the ground
But from here it's only up so good luck
Yea it might be rough fighting addiction
But all of your strength comes from within
So you can change it oh
You can change it oh

Pathological liar
Went to my girlfriend's house and set her dog on fire
Blamed it on her little brother, got him sent to juvi
Fucked her in the bathroom while her dad was watchin' movies
Reach in to my backpack for a fully loaded UZI
Started shootin' up the room he was in
That Chapelle show episode, you know, Paule Mooney was in
Told her everything would be alright
Just don't scream as I dismount
Left the crib, started searchin' for a discount
Exorcist, I need to get some help with this
Once as sweet as Welch's is, think he went insane though
Must have been the drugs in him, he love to sniff the yayo
Insane, could accompany a angel
But maybe one day I can be somebody's angel
Catalog with greatest hits
Sacred does what sacred is
And people raise their brows when you weird as Al Yankovich
I just wanna make out with groupies and play with tits
Snort H and shit, just forget what day it is
I'm eatin' Seder with Clinton and Ralf Nader
Tradin' Acres and bettin' millions against the Lakers
Spittin' out what used to be a children's favorite flavor
Sentenced to hell but I'm out on good behavior
Oh shit, got a new neighbor

[Break: Humming ""The Star-Spangled Banner""]

[Verse 2]
Still alive in a room full of melted candles
Lost my job, now I'm in New York sellin' sandals
Saw Christopher Stokes and SW Randall
Introduced my youngest cousin to him, told him he was DTF
They probably had some freaky sex, really, I'm not worried
Already plan to kill myself when the clock hits 7:30
Readin' Hamlet out loud in a room by myself
Givin' different characters different voices, I think it helps
Storyline and flow of the plot
Got a gun in my dresser, it's holdin' a shot

"
343,23500,Alone,Marnik,"[Verse 1: Truck North]
Trapped, no shield, no sword
The unbeaten path got my soul so sore
Allured by the lust, something money can't cure
The Devil want me as is, but God he want more
Eyes closed, eyes open, great another day, here we go
Like a nigga woke up late in The Truman Show
Living life without a care, mean pokerface
But I'm forced to play solitaire 'til I get up out of here
Move like a wanted man with a bounty on his head
Work alone, sleep alone, eat alone, daily bread
Counting 'til my fingers red, how you gon' judge a man?
Walking in the shoes of a man with a broken leg
Flame on the trail headed for the powder keg
Last place in the race I ain't never led
Like I ain't never bled, time to get up out of bed
Serving in the army of one, it's on again

[Hook: Dice Raw]
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone

[Verse 2: Greg Porn]
I'm in a chess match, I'm in a death trap
I'm tryna find out where the eggs in the nest at
I'm one blood when the sky turns jet black
No love in the world can correct that
I'm in a slow lane, I'm on my Cobain
I'm in the new spot tryna run a old game
I got a new chick, put out my old flame
No peace, no sleep, no love for a young beast
You can put me in a cage
You can put me in the jungle where the lion get blazed
There ain't no hell like the hell I raise
I'd die in the bed I made 'fore I lay with a love I loathe
I'm a snake in the garden of bones
I'm a loner in a world of clones
I'm the piece that don't belong, see I roam
Where the Reaper roam 'till they put my name on a stone

[Hook: Dice Raw]
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
The longest walk I'll probably ever be on
The road to perdition, guess I'm finna get my plea on
I pray these wings strong enough to carry me on
I promise every second felt as if it took an eon
Walking like the lost boys of Sierra Leone
The trail of tears what they got me like a Cherokee on
Between the ears something I require therapy on
For working to the bone like my name Robert Guillaume
I go above and beyond, the duty called, truly y'all
Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call
Ask me if I'm just another mouli or a movie star
Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard
Walk alone, talk alone, get my Charlie Parker on
Make my mark alone, shed light upon the dark alone
Get my sparkle on, it's a mission I'm embarking on
A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home

[Hook: Dice Raw]
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone

I've told you this once before:
Can't control me
If you try to take me down
You're gonna break
I feel your every nothing
That you're doin' for me
I'm thinking you oughta
Make your own way

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Stand alone, stand alone...

[Verse 2]
You're always hiding behind
Your so-called goddess
So, what? You don't think
That we can see your face?
Resurrected back before
The final falling
I'll never rest until
I can make my own way

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not afraid of fading...

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone

[Bridge]
And now it's my time (Now it's my time)
It's my time to dream (It's my time to dream)
Dream of the skies (Dream of the skies)
Make me believe that this place
Isn't plagued by the poison in me
And help me decide if my fire will burn out
Before you can breathe
Breathe into me

[Chorus]
I stand alone inside
I stand alone
I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside

354,23594,Illusion,Ragunde,"Nota Bene:
Jeg har det som en pose lort der snakker skidt
Pessimist men spiller smart, sådan rasende ordekvilibrist
Presser mig selv op i et hjørne på et sortseende egotrip
Piller mit eget ned før jeg piller ved dit
Og når det er gjort er jeg klar på at flip
Men fortsætter selvmorderisk til spejlbilledet ik glor så trist
Skidtet snurrer hylekoret råber dramaqueen
Se de broer du har bygget ja de brænder fint
Nyder nedturen og smagen af virkelighed
Vil så gerne være glad men 'til jeg blir det blir jeg ved
Med den der selvfede selvmedlidenhed
Har for længst anerkendt det sådan det lettest at leve livet
Holder esserne tæt til kroppen
Testen skal nok komme så indtil den fester jeg med flokken
Messed up LMS'er forveksler tiden med klokken
Lever livet baglæns og sætter mig på skriveblokken
Knotten ogginok jeg blir nok aldrig voksen
Jeg knokler på cuts og buster fejlfrit i boksen
Så what the fuck det hele går jo nok
Og ærlig talt har livet aldrig været bedre for det pjok
Så hvad er der med mit brok er det forfængelighed
Er NB forelsket i egen elendighed
Nej jeg går bare hele vejen for at lede
Efter min fordrejede egocentriske menneskelighed

Omkvæd:
Jeg tager min tid
Til at anerkende min depressive sides eksistens
Jeg lader den bide
Og æder giften til jeg bliver resistens

Vi lever så godt
Vi har det så rart
I en verden af dollargrin hvor det er gratis at græde

Illusionisten:
Jeg ser mig selv i spejlet nikker til den fremmede
Et skræmmende billede må sænk blikket med det samme
For sent til at fortrænge eller undslippe skammen
For brikkerne sir det hele når jeg lægger dem sammen
Jeg kravler op at et reb der brænder op nedefra
Med en abe på ryggen med mission at mislede mig
Har skeletter i skabet samt en blodig kedeldragt
Og de vedvarende mareridt er efterhånden begyndt at kede mig
Er ik kridthuset nok nærmere i kulkælderen
Godt beruset på gulvet med mærker fra hugtænder
Har mistet smilet så jeg ruller op igen
Og går tilbage til den fremmede kvinde i den fremmede dobbeltseng
Lykken lokker med sine forførende stoffer
Det skal åbenbart gå ned af bakke for det kører for mig
Tøserne jeg stalker har ik følelser for mig
Jeg blot en følelsesblotter som cuttere og forsøgsrotter
Flygter fra fortidens spøgelser og monstre
Og snaver med døden uden at vide hvad kyssene de koster
En kryster en hustler jeg er den fødte taber
Men har hovedet på skriveblokken lige til øksen falder
Jeg lever på lånt tid og skylder for guldårerne
Samt det guldhjerte jeg stjal fra mit hjertes udkårne
Amor ramte plet jeg ku ik dæk skudsårene
Så nu føler mig kun i live og kniven snitter pulsårerne

Omkvæd

Chewbacca:
Efter jobbet løsner jeg bæltet og burer mig inde
Og tager en omgang skyggeboksning med mine knuder derinde
Der er mange løse ender og følelser vi gemmer
Tomheden kan snige sig ind på dig som om den forsøger at sige
Kom og dø lidt med mig
Det er en fornemmelse for sne som frøken Smillas
Men hvis du kan mærk den på varme dage må du røbe det for det smitter
Kan føle det nogen gange selvom min kvinde er tæt på mig
Noget inde i mig griner indædt som om det forventer ekstra nummer
Ekstra hunger -rigeligt føde men intet for sjæl og sind
Gi mig balance nok så jeg kan føle mig hel igen
Jeg er typen der siger for meget og røber min skrøbelige sider
Indtil jeg selv indser det og mærker en klump ca. hvor drøblen sidder
Så gi mig mundkurv på når jeg prædiker det blå
Kun du kan løft mig op af det når jeg træder i små selvhadende sko
Men lad det nu gå – krybene kradser
Men pyt jeg trasker videre for atter at få ro
For nu passer jeg på med skærpet fokus og klarsyn
Så når tingene ramler sammen om ørene på mig
Og filmkulisserne græder og kulørerne drukner
- står jeg klar med min lille sørgelige kuffert
Klar med min love i dag klar til aldrig at se os tilbage
Uanset hvad fanden det er på bekostning af
Men du kan ik flygt fra tomhedens gab
Så bare bliv ved med at tømme din sjæl din crusty abe

[Estrofa 1]
Cosmonauta inerte con su nave al frente
Y solo un gato de tripulación
Se prepara un baño con la tierra abajo
Intuyendo que eres tu la misión si

[Pre-estribillo]
Cae el agua lentamente y sin más el dirá

[Estribillo]
Voy buscando un fallo en ti y no
Aunque busque un fallo en ti no aparece
Lo más raro que hay en ti soy yo, soy yo

[Estrofa 2]
Cae al suelo a veces pero apenas duele ya
La gravedad solo es una ilusión aquí
Neptuniana a veces, tan extraña siempre
Que pareces ciencia ficción

Aunque altere los factores da igual, da igual

Voy buscando un fallo en ti y no
Aunque busque un fallo en ti no aparece
Lo más raro que hay en ti soy yo, soy yo

Sección de cuerda algún trombón
Empieza a oír la orquesta que solo está en mi manera de pensar
Es la versión del director
Sin cortes que eliminen la escena ardiente que he ideado al despertar

Podría ser una visión como el astronauta que vio a Elvis

I can't stop

[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die, I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Black cards, black cars, black on black, Black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for

[Post-Chorus: JAY-Z, Kanye West & both]
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Yeah, who gon' stop me?

Niggas talking, they bitch-made, ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's Pig Latin, itch-bay, who gon' stop me, huh?
Last night ain't go so well, got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert, yes, tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say nothin'
Heard she fucked the doorman, well, that's cool, I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces

Who gon' stop me, huh?
Beat the odds, beat the feds
It wouldn't be wise to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, six to six
Give me one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white wearin' no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy, they don't have no proof
I'm three steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gamblin'
Lucky lefty, I expect a seven
I went through hell, I'm expectin' heaven
I'm owed, 'cause I'm dough, and I stuck to the G-code
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't goin' nowhere
Okay, here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to havin' bunny ears, like broke, like nope

Shit gotta come in some way, fuck
When you growing up worthless, uh
Middle finger to my old life, uh
Special shoutout to my oldhead, uh
If it wasn't for your advice, uh
A nigga would have been so dead, uh
I'm living life 'til these niggas kill me
Turn this up if you niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, tryna get filthy

Graduated to the MoMA
And I did all of this without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna

Could've been a chemist, 'cause I cook smart
Only thing can stop me is me, hey
And I'ma stop when the hook start, hold up

Pioneer, started on my corner like the Cold Crush
Had smokers linin' up the block like a gold rush
The sayin' ""live fast and die young"" is what they told us (me ah gon' murder dem)

363,23555,(Rock) Superstar,Cypress Hill,"[Interlude: Chino Moreno]
Alot of a… sharks out there… try'na take a bite of somethin'. What's hot. Lot of chameleons out there… try'na change up. Anytime somethin' new comes along… everybody wants a bite. Don't happen overnight

[Intro: B-Real]
So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

[Verse 1: B-Real]
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you don't know
About the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers
And losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
Shit's deep, 48 tracks
Studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will till he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way
Still trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsing
No fans, no fame, no respect, no change, no women
And everybody shits on your name

[Chorus: B-Real]
So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
Be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

[Interlude: Everlast]
People see rockstars, younawhaI'msayin? But you still… try'na… get out more like, like everybody else. You know? It's a fun job, but it's still a job, you know? Save your money man, save your money too. Hit single don't last very long, younawhaI'msayin? I mean…you're lucky in this game too. There's gon' be another cat comin' out. Lookin' like me, soundin' like me, next year I know this. They'll be a flipside, do whatchu did. Somebody'll try to spin off like some series

[Verse 2: Sen Dog]
You ever have big dreams of makin' big cream?
Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream
You wanna look trendy in the Bentley
Be a snob and never act friendly
You wanna have big fame, let me explain
What happens to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be okay
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
That's while fools end up dining on the bullet
Think everything's fine in the big time
See me in my Lex' with the chrome raised high
So you wanna roll far and live large?
It ain't all that goes with bein' a rock star

[Chorus: B-Real]
So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

[Verse 3: B-Real]
My own son don't know me
I'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm with my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or video didn't show me
No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
They're too worried about them honies at the Palladium
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
Till the next rock superstar with no shame
Give him a year, he'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin' ignored, I warned him
Assured him, this ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal
""Assassins, assassins""

[Chorus: B-Real]
So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

Don't lose yourself in the light, woah

Take a chance, forget the old
Tried to fit to a different mold
Was it fate or did we collide
From parallel in another life

And I don't want to be so sad that we are who we are
'Cause we had no control

Will we ever make headlines?
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame?
When we've only ourselves to blame?

So I won't sleep
No more
No, I won't sleep
No more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
No more
Like I could always
No DMT won't stop me
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream
No more
(Dream no more)

[Verse 2]
So get this doubt out of my head
It's only real if you let it
And I've been letting go of my ghosts
I'll never let them catch me no more
But these words are all I have
So I'll just keep dreaming out loud
And if I just keep talking
Maybe I'll figure all this out

[Pre-Chorus]
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines?
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame?
And we've only ourselves to blame?

I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around

I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk
Is when our clothes are coming off
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah

You are my glass half empty
Sipping my ocean dry
Emotionally spin me
'Till none of our planets could align
But I could stand you one more night

Lay all your laundry on the bed

400,23690,A LIGHT THAT NEVER COMES,Linkin Park,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead
It comes that day, it's off with his head

A night gets darkest, right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then, when you're gone

'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

The night gets darkest, right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I've been waiting for it, so long

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh, oh, oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
And I told them, nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun

Maybe somehow freeze the sunrise
Make every second ours
Got me feelin' so high
Floating up to cloud 9

Oh-oh-oh, spell

I want to be with you

And you ain't like that I moved to LA but you kept them feelings bottled
Baby girl you know my motto
Once you get yourself right and chase your dreams that's the moment that the love gon' follow
But that never meant that I didn't wanna try
Used to get a text from you every month now my phone turning dry
Still called your phone 150 times
Would've been 151 but I stopped myself started asking why?
Why I'm worried bout somebody who ain't worried bout me
I tried to give you your space and respect your boundaries
Tryna find reasons I should leave you and I went and found 3
You're a liar, selfish and you ain't stick by me
But I don't need a bitch, I'm not the needy type
I never stressed or never cared about a bitch so I'ma be alright
So please don't hit my phone saying you need a flight
I can't find one good reason to keep you in my life (ooh)

441,23738,Darkness,Giorno,"Non riempivo il tuo vuoto
Ero lì ma ero assente/
Ho visto come poco
Può diventare niente
Per chi sfoga in un pogo
Il suo passato nel presente
Questo è l'unico modo
Per dire quello che sente/
Indosso un colore freddo
Che era tenue, tieni a mente
Prima di questo gelo
C'era calore latente/
Di te cotto da sempre
Ma al dente
Ora portami lontano
Dal giudizio della gente/
Tu restami accanto, è un giorno come un altro
Ho capito che il resto non conta poi tanto
Mi chiedi dove prendo questa merda di cui canto
Ho fatto un brutto sogno però non mi alzo di
Scatto/
E il fuoco lo alimento, divampa in un testo
Tra un cambio di vita ed un cambio di accento
Però parla di te quindi come non detto
Fanculo ciò che provo e le cazzate che mi metto/
Lo scrivo di getto, c'è inchiostro nel letto
E la macchia non si lava è con me ferma qua
Dentro
Non sento più nulla ed ho un segno sul petto
Mi guardo allo specchio però non mi ci rifletto
E il mio cuore pompa sangue, rientra che è palta
Di ansia a di rabbia, hai una maschera in faccia
Che inizia dove ti finisce la frangia, ma baciarti il
Collo per farla cadere non basta/
Chiuso nel mio cervello sono un animale in
Gabbia
Coi piedi sotto terra perché il pavimento è sabbia
Di la verità, chi è sincero non sbaglia
Però mi fotte sempre la parola che mi scappa/
Mettevo sopra i fogli quello che volevo dirti
Adesso hai per capirmi due minuti e quindici
Barre manuali con indici è da cinici
Noi in rapporti stabili con cambiamenti ciclici/
Adesso piove su di me
Bagna le mie metriche
Adesso piove su di me
Bagna le mie metriche
Luce splende su di me
Com'è che non vedi che
Luce splende su di me
Mi copro che non vedo niente
Testa nelle nuvole
Nere sono succube
Chiara La lanterna
Carnefice di lucciole
Testa nelle nuvole
Chiare stanno su di me
È buia ma si alterna
La mia solitudine

445,23736,When We Were Still Young,Klaas,"First time, i tried to put my heart on the line
Ironic how i was left out hanging to dry
Pure intentions only had me thinking of demise
My demise, devise a plan on committing suicide
Back then i used to think that god was on my side

I was overreacting, the heart is fragile at times
This time, i'd like to think a nigga's becoming wise
Road to riches is narrow they claim that it's open wide

What it cost... to be the boss? me flexing
And claiming sauce
Sleep could never make up for all the
Drеams that i bought
The few niggas i argue with arе really my bros
Niggas say their friends just because they never fought

Wait... few things that i gotta address it's hard
Women say they love me, i'm starting to think i'm soft
Been like this since 2015 i know that i'm wrong
Few women gonna get touched when they hear this song

Crack a joke and y'all think i'm opening up my heart
Never been a player i know i look like a fraud
Honesty and humor make up for a great loss, but
Again... we never met, i got tired of playing lost
Never been the person who brushes some people off
I'm stressing, honestly i'm just venting, i'll keep it short

I'm struck by a few but not enough to fall in love
Dodged a bullet told myself that i'm never getting involved

Apologies if you ever feel like i led you on
I'd understand if you wish you never met me at all
Won't swear i'm different i got a bigger purpose on this
Earth than showing a few women i'm good and proving them wrong

We pessimistic, life goes on
Good times we seem to miss 'em

All i ever think about is family and getting richer
But prior to me making this song
It's really sad, but i find it funny how i'm attached to
Everything that's little
Shell, hard as hell. nowadays i'm feeling brittle
Mid life crisis but i'm 20 this shit's a riddle
I'm cold, i'm tired, running in circles, stuck in the middle...
Of nowhere
Man i'd rather not go there
Know you might get offended
I cut ties with some people still wish that it never ended
I'd rather be alone than show love... and still be pretending
Family stressing asking when is this shit gonn' be ending
What's the message i'm sending?

Ohh, man it's awkward
Things lose meaning, grow apart, we're barely talking
Used to see my neighbour now and then, now
We meet often

Bonds break only for the better... who am i tossing?
Maybe for the worse, above all... i see some coffins
Peers are really stressing and dying, i see the losses

Used to be a therapist for most, but i grew toxic

Pressures of being a young man and being an artist
Or asshole, think i'm stuck in a manhole... shit is garbage
Deep in my feelings i spark a blunt and then get to coughing
Flaws in my image, some day i'll get to flossing
If flowers die colourful, i'll smile 'til i hit the coffin
""pretty expires, beauty remains"" is another topic

Jeah!
Hope i never fall
Or lose passion
That's all
THAT'S ALL

Si la ves pasar un sueño cógelo del cuello
Una vez en la vida y hay solo un tren

[Verso 1: Elphomega]
Tu no la puedes tocar, paseo arriba con sus minishorts
Bien ceñidos, gana distancia a pasos encendidos
Un trozo de oro moviéndose en un sentido
En un flash se pierde, ya estás vacio, te quedas sin premio
Desaparece en el sonido del mar
Otro sueño que se aleja sin más, sin dar, montao en bala
Una balada californiana pal alma
Si eres de los que le piden volar al alba cuando es malva
Yo pongo el micro bajo esta barba
Y convoco a fieles como Graceland a lomo de esta bassline
Irradio rayos Tesla en canciones de perdida y sal
El destello de un cuarzo al pasar que deslumbra llamas
La llave a tus cadenas cuelgan de esas caderas
Siguen esas maneras, que pueden marear a cualquiera al mirar
Palabra, porque atraen más que el suave aroma de un blunt

[Estribillo: Elphomega]
Ahí va con su rodar sobre sus largas piernas, wha, no la pierdas, tras su silueta
Van to las miradas, inalcanzable, rollergirl
Ahí va con su rodar sobre sus largas piernas, wha, no la pierdas, tras su silueta
Van to las miradas rollergirl

[Verso 2: Elphomega]
Tiene detrás a espantapájaros y hombres de lata como Dorothy en Oz
Quieren llamar su atención
Pisar su sombra, bajo sus cabellos de sol hay gloria
Un deseo que se retiene en la memoria veloz
Entre palmera, Volkswagen y locos del surf asoma
Y como espuman, entre la bruma del calor se esfuma
Kryptonics manca en el rotal del trauma
Ella no es tuya, al menos de esta forma sin pausa
Es otro expreso que va que zumba
Es otro anhelo en carrera con felpe calzetas blancas de luz profunda
Estoy en el boom bap
Arqueólogo en ideas fecunda, va con segundas
Solo, sin pactar en juntas, una esperanza oculta
Hay que guardarla bien, cuando se pierden tantas
Cuando se pierden tantas

[Estribillo: Elphomega]
Ahí va con su rodar sobre sus largas piernas, wha, no la pierdas, tras su silueta
Van to las miradas, inalcanzable, rollergirl
Ahí va con su rodar sobre sus largas piernas, wha, no la pierdas, tras su silueta
Van to las miradas rollergirl

But if I get too close you're withdrawn
I'm confused, what's the matter
No I'm not gonna keep holding on
You don't know what you got till its gone
It's this now, oh forever

[Pre-Chorus]
And your parents say they like me a lot
I cook dinner with your momma [?]
I like this life we're living
But somethings missing
I need more

[Chorus]
I, I don't wanna say love first
I'm afraid I might get hurt
Oh, if I tell you I'm falling
Where love is safe or will I be sorry?
How come you won't say love first?
I need you to say those words
I'm feeling when you touch my body
Open your mouth and say that you want me

[Bridge]
Baby, are you hearing what I'm saying
Or do I gotta use an ultimatum?
I know you wanna say love
But you're too scared to fuck up
Oh no, I almost said it
Wait a second

[Chorus]
I, I don't wanna say love first
I'm afraid I might get hurt
Oh, if I tell you I'm falling
Where love is safe or will I be sorry?
How come you won't say love first?
I need you to say those words
I'm feeling when you touch my body
Open your mouth and say that you want me

Rhythm and drums and the booming track
The base of love in the world to see
How children live in harmony

These things are not from heaven sent
But... I will demand
I sought everywhere and all around
Even on the floor and do not count

Come to the stairs to somewhere in the sky
Show me a star and don't ask me why
Show me the way to a place of love
Show me all the way to the base of love
The base of love. The base of love
The base of love. The base of love

Ooh na na na na na na na na
Get on the dance floor people you feel free
Do that kiss and I and G
Wave them hands up in the air

And feel the love from everywhere
It's not I think but very nice
Hope you felt this more than twice
From the sky and all above
Come on see the base of love

Can't you feel my love, love; do you like the sound?
We are made of dreams, heaven knows we are
Angels sang a song where we killed the superstar

People talk, just let them talk, we're better than that
Would you meet me in a high of Saturday night?
People hate, just let them hate, we're better than that

And if it all falls down, we'll be way up high
When we're bringing back paradise, yeah

I don't even care, I think I'm going numb
Sick of all this running, sick of being down
They got so much to say, got so much to bring
But way I see their lips moving I don't hear a thing

Will be million miles away on Saturday night?

And he always got a way of staying in command
Oh, yeah, and he likes a babe
Trying something new and she not afraid
Dressing up all cute and she looking great
And she know how I do almost every day
Step one: have a little fun
Yeah, we're here to live, not here to run
Step two: find someone cute
'Cause we all deserve somebody new
And step three: make a memory
Down a couple beers and drink heavily
Step four: no regrets
Just enjoy whatever happens next

Yeah
Let's go

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
King Push
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number, I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage, Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la Renta
Your hijo pequeño, my nachos bel grande
Stay sippin' that André, spent three stacks, that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim, they say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say: breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire, trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time, you Hyundais
Y'all couch niggas, we stand on 'em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-Boys still ball the same, just gotta little bit of glam on it
Yah!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
Yo, I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic, I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says, ""What's up?""

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a looney (Uh)
Wish upon a star (So what's up?)
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
'Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that Category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste, nigga
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
'Cause if music and money is the motive, then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin', I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Go, go, go, go-go (Uh), go, go, go, uh
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: RetcH]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', this pill got me open
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke, but tell Butter roll a blunt
'Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own drugs and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try 'em
He'll call me RetcH, but your bitch call me Brian
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm trappin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin' (What?)
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trannies 'cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds and bitches all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine on chill and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in L.A. with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit, Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all on the bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill nigga shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
Four gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Coach like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' this shit, so for the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to rain
Get love in the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of Hell's Kitchen praying he don't stick to the stove
God got me, illumi-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
Buy 150, let me tell y'all now, I want Nikki
Lift her up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play Problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (What)
Keep fresh just in Margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (Don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (Naw!)
Compton niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
Know once it's almost over tryin' to jerk the wheel
You nervous, like them cutters he'd inject the speed
And you think you mothafucka faking me, my nigga? (What)
Yeah I bet a nigga crawl to the crown
I'm a boss, hire hoes while I bottle out
I see them niggas shaking hands and biting styles
Got her to stay city in 'cause I fired her spouse
'Cause I'm a mad man
Just fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the Sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (Diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more .4 5's and 9's and I ain't talking bout no Js
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter, Chachi-palooza
Riding shotty in the Chevy bitch old as a cougar
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy use the porthole please
Get it good girl, use your knees, I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (For real)
Back on my Compton shit, demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (Huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (What)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(Check!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's two or three and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button (Beep)
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223 (Do, do, do ,do)
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key (Uh-huh)
Bitch we great, bitch we great (Great), fuckin' set (Set)
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get, get, we gotta get, get, we gonna take it first
We jump, said bitch we jump, we gotta make it (Yeah)
Couple racks up on them Wikki stiks
Yo bitch, she smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink 'til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga, all I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga, mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal, NY, them eagles
Fly through, get high too, fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group, come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin, boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun poundin', keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me, me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up, that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up, Hennessy, Louis V
Me and you, me and her, we as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one, freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since eight and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like ""Nigga don't move""
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk butter like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado]
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, ""What's good?""
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, ""What's good?""
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room, legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon? All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack, just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening, now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls, redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up, wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor, burning monks to feel the timbre
Part of the action, retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them, watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Zombie Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, three grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want, I'm a zombie, bitch, I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo', Prada never gonna pile up if you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meechy Darko]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga, let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know, niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lecter
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible, I've been on my mind for days
'Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill King
Niggas stay shot, shit stay locked, I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like ""Fuck the rest""
When I need bread, I'm like ""Fuck the rest""
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game, let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, ""no way""
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
A Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real West Side nigga, 4.2 bitch
They might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
Your bitch put me high up on a nigga to-do list
You can do that, fuck nigga do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on gay shit
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's Prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Erik Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz? I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the MAC, truck bulletproofed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of Pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz? My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once, no voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 01 01, hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 01 01, hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Bimmer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Ninas
Instead, I was that nigga puffin' reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
'Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga gripper of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the worst you'll see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome, your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back, cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb and I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man, I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang, I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame, I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride, hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die, pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest, right now chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say ""fuck fate"", if I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to while I'm fine dining on YouTube, bruh
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with a Onyx on, Nefertiti on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing, these rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter, one two, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something, I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable, make sure it ain't sitting on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body, fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up, I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
'Til all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry, in backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are, I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you, then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr. 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger! Y'all got me drunk as hell, uh
Now I been red since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your bitch in the 'Lac, grippin' his wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, and you can roll it, roll it
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see I'm servin' foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody else to eat but her
She be like fuck them bitches, stack the digits
Compliment this Fendi fit, condiment or sentimental
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprint on my doors, they all on the seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe ring, featured by E
Bitches know it's time out
This bitch be fucking me so good, I be like, ""Time out!""
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
And how she stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like, ""Time out!""
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant 'gar, she tall like 'Zilla, I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo of an anaconda
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked, no pajamas
Lil' homie ranned off with lots of lumber
For that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a bean together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growin' wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my thing together
I turn her up and then we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Mykko Montana, my father say I got stamina
I'm cooking the Hannah Montana-na, I bury these hoes like sandals them
I kill every one of my features, I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yellow pages, just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian Mercedes
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing ""daddy's home""
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it and right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh, my nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day one hundred, cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit, you just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out faster than cancer sticks
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar, Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face, hoes like ""he so angry"", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you, real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit, it's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: CUZ Lightyear]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Looked like Joan, we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes,I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit, pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader, still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa? Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster, World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga, that's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
As far as everyone goes, they can suck and kneel on it
We have another song, gotta fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka, happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social, no, a nigga fan
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh, got those motherfucking custom Roshes, feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit, my Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson, I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic, paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt, three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the Philly
My daughter's neck is chilly, my son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth, ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep, that's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cummin' in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I'm ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, I'm spending
You lames and you fall, I'm like 2 Chainz when I ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
Despite sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
It's horrendous what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all 'til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em, I don't write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched and your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressin'
Scorin' high off the fresh pressses, brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good, I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper and she gave me the sloppy goooood
So you should tip her if you execute, young leisure suit
Larry with no extra loot, my ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', me like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemies
Yo what's up, see me on motherfucker tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum (drum)
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
No damn, no shit, not zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
No damn no shit zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz]
A muthafucka need that work? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need that thing, that thing, then I got it right here
Yeah, motherfucker, I got it right here, I got it right here
A muthafucka need that work? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need that thing, that thing, then I got it right here
Yeah muthafucka, I-- muthafucka I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
I said most of these niggas gon' hate, me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon swing, we all gon catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap, Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase, but I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time, you ain't tryin' to get no funds
Two-9 shit 'til I die, I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese LAFLARE]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh, big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending, been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
But to our niggas, we gettin' it with that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a cake to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris, and free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off Rocky, rottweiler just to watch it
Maybachs for the profit, get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers, press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing, no tags, nigga, fuck the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne, and a 3 page spread
I was sleepin' on the flow, just a couple months later
Now I'm purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, gold for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
Target my ankh, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be ending me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A Black Clan king, respect the illustrator
Don't you dare ever try the Elohim, fuck flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up kid, put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9
We're the new 2 Live Crew, give up, bitch
Send 'em all to Hell, kill this shit
Spit it like braille, gotta feel this shit
Gotta check up, haters still sick
Yellin' kill 'em all and I'm on ball like I'm Billups, bitch

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work
Catch no Zs, chilled on purp
And ya bitch came second but my bills on first
East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn, the fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm all but the limousine
Swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene, yeah, that's a Spit 16
Hearts inside of my tip jar, like a bleedin' heart beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin' then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like Vans, I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans, go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross for all of that 15 minute fame
But I'ma get in your ears and the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip and just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork, I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit with a pistol, dro is full of his disorders, I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My broad on da eastside ho nigga
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it, flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it, running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get ""Faith"" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID, game need me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some game
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
Throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', ""Oh well""
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blasted, naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Commander and chief, my sons is Son of Sam with the beef
We get loot, always ran from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know? So much wax in this blunt I'm smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
You think I'm fuckin' mad, I'm too so
I'm out of it, bitch, oh, nah, fuck that
Bring them fuckin' trumpets back
Light a dub sack for my niggas who slung crack
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
Fucker I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch
"
495,23846,Haters,Deorro,"Boy, I can make it rain
Jiggle, hit and bail
And then more knows I gotta gotta
Get My Fucking Haters Off

497,23804,Get on Up,Luis Rodriguez,"Summary

Yo, what it is? This week haters gonna hate with Othello by William Shakespeare. One day soulja boy Iago kickin it with some fool named Roderigo when Roddy all like “Say Iago, why didn’t you tell me my girl Desdemona gone and married Othello? You know I’ve been tryin to hit that.” Iago say “Man f*** Othello. He gave a bump to dat scrub Cassio when it should be me climbin the ranks. Plus, I’m ‘spectin Othello been freakin on my woman. So fool best watch hisself cuz I’m comin fo him.” Revenge, sucka!

When word come to Dessy’s pappi, he get all up in Othello’s bidness and say “B**** did yo black-ass cast a spell on my daughter?” Othello like “Naw, blood. Ever since I told her bout all the s*** I’ve seen, she been ALL up on this.” Desdemona come in and sets daddy straight, and joins Othello and his homies to wreck that Turkish army that be rollin up on Cyprus. Up in Cyprus, Iago tricks Othello’s number 2 man Cassio into throwin back a lil too much drank. When Othello see C-dawg actin a fool, he gives him the boot. But Iago ain’t done messin. He tell Cassio “Say bruh, you should hit up Desdemona and axe if she can get Othello to smoothe things over.” But on the real, Iago playin dirty.

He tell Othello he best watch his b**** cuz she might be gettin down with Cassio. Othello ain’t buyin it at first, but when Iago plants one of Desdemona’s hankerchiefs in Cassio’s crib, brutha start wonderin. And Othello get all turnt up when he sees Cassio goin on about some woman he playin, cuz Iago make Othello think C-money talkin dirty bout Desdemona. After dat, Othello say “Man I’m gonna ICE that B****. Iago, if you my man, you’ll merc Cassio.” Not wanting to get his hands dirty, Iago convinces Roderigo to kill Cassio.

Even though s*** goes sideways, Iago still comes out on top. Roderigo can’t snitch since Iago put his ass six feet deep, and Cassio got a gnarly cut. Later, Othello rolls up on his woman, and straight chokes a b**** to death. When Iago’s biddy Emilia comes in, she like “WHAT THE F***, OTHELLO?” Othello tell her what’s up, and Emilia immediately calls Iago out, sayin he been lying his ass off. Iago like “b**** shut up!” And ENDS her. Man, what is this? The NFL? Knowin he got played, Othello stabs Iago and then ices himself before the po-po can put him away fo good.

Analysis

Ain’t no doubt dat fool Iago does some dirty s*** up in this play. But as bad as he is, you can’t deny that brutha do his own thang -- and with style.

Quote from play: “In following him I follow myself. / Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty, / But seeming so for my peculiar end. / For when my outward action doth demonstrate / The native act and figure of my heart / In compliment extern ‘tis not long after / But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve / For daws to peck at. I am not what I am” (Act 1, scene 1, lines 59-65).

Now if you bust open yo copy of Exodus and slide you b****-ass to 3:14, you’ll see dat fool God saying something similar: “I am what I am.” Like the big G-man, Iago pullin all the strings up in this heezy. But also, it’s like Iago dun flipped dem holy words words on they ass. Cuz Iago take good things, flips em around, and makes em evil. In fact, that’s how he stir up dat beef between Dezzy and Othello.

Quote from play: “And by how much she strives to do [Cassio] good / She shall undo her credit with the Moor. / So will I turn her virtue into pitch, / And out of her own goodness make the net / That shall enmesh them all” (Act 2, scene 3, lines 324-336).

Now y’all playas know Willy S never play it straight, and he’s always blurrin dat line between good and bad. When Roderigo start goin off bout virtue, Iago all like:

Quote from the play: “Virtue? A fig! ‘Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners” (Act 1, scene 3, lines 316-17).

Now what Iago really sayin is all hustlas are gardens, and the only one saying what you gotta plant is yo-self. Not God or anybody else. You make yourself what you want to be. Matter of fact, ol Willy got Iago tear down that holy jive all throughout this play. Fo example, when Iago tryin to convince Othello that his woman gettin freak nasty with Cassio, Othello like “Hell naw B. I got faith my Biddy love me.” But after showin him the handkerchief and lurin him to the convo between Cassio and Desdemona, Iago convince Othello “Man f*** faith. SEEING is believing, homeboy.” Too bad Othello don’t know what love is something you can’t see. But that’s okay playa cuz you can still show me love by hitting dat subscribe button. Catch y’all lata. Peace!

539,23895,Hipsta,Timmy Trumpet,"VERSE 1:
Rock up at a cafe that’s all the rage
Stare at the waiter, till we get a menu
I like what’s on the page
Not a bad vibe. Not a bad venue

Tell me bout your bovine. What do they eat?
What’s the river they drink from?
And tell me bout your coffee beans
Are they Arabican, Columbian, or Mandheling Lintong?

Have you got anything gluten free?
I’m no celiac, but it disagrees with me
Mmmm, and I don’t like toxins either -
Should I cleanse my liver with a ginger tea?

I think we’ll order, the tap water
The wifi password and hang for a bit
Hey brah what’s the track that’s playing?
This ain't no hipster shit

VERSE 2:
I’m so busy, life’s a chore
Every Saturday I work in a retail store
Keeping busy on a casual shift
Casually chilling, not giving a shit

Hanging at the counter, trawling Tinder
Trying to find a random, I can finger
Have a green smoothie, cause I’m vegan
Mmmm, tastes like dragon semen

Here comes the boss, to check the status
Gotta look busy. Move the hangers
Having to make career compromises
Like; “hey brah, need a hand with sizes?”

Getting ready. Night in the city
Order a bag and some disco biccies
Shooting up bath salts - That was ace!
Does anyone feel like eating their own face?!

Step out the uber, party time
Polish off my red wine
Stroll up, to the front of the line
The door-guy knows me, I’m here all the time

Doesn’t let us in. We’re not on the list
Gotta line up with the povo kids
Honestly who do I have to fist
For some cunt to put my name on this list?

Dom I wish we never came! I hate this club, this night’s so lame!
Sorry, what? I can not understand a single word you’re saying!
I think my pingers’ kicking in! This DJ’s fucking killing it!
Hey DJ what’s this track you’re playing? This ain't no hipster shit

OUTRO:

Is this the first time you’ve seen him live?

No brah. Earlier this year I saw him play this like super secret underground set at a no-name pop-up venue in the city

Cool. Yeah did I ever tell you about that time a few years ago I was hanging out with Gollum and we saw him spinning records in the back of a taco truck in downtown LA

No, but that sounds rad man…. I remember back in 2003 me and these random council worker lollypop guys dumped a bunch of pingers and saw him play, at this underground rave in a storm water drain

Oh yeah? Well this one time in like 1994 when I was in my first year of high school, I walked into 7/11 and opened up the ice cream freezer and there he was just dropping some mad beats for all the Bubble-O Bills, and the Cornetto’s were all pissed off because I left the freezer open too long and they started to melt

Cool man, I remember when I was just born back in like 1982 my mum took me to the doctors for a check up, and the doctor played me this ultrasound where you could hear him fist pumping inside his mother’s womb, so yeah. Pretty underground

Zoned out with a blank stare

It's my time, 'bout time, my turn, I can't lie
Waiting for that one spark
My one hope to catch fire
I'm fine, I'm high
Light rain through that sunshine
Tryin' to man this old boat
I'm the captain now and it's crunch time
I don't care if I'm gettin' paid
Need the week but I get the day
Wide awake when I need sleep
I'm knee deep but I set the way
Focused on that one mistake, let it free don't let it break
Fuck it all, I'm turning in
My celly's off, the great escape

Blacked out
Everything faded on your love
I’m already wasted so close
That I can taste it now, now
So let’s break right out of these gilded cages
We’re going to make it now
Don’t ever turn around
Don’t ever turn around

[Chorus]
Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
There ain’t no reason to stay
We’ll be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

[Verse 2]
White lights, flirt in the darkness
This road leads where your heart is
These signs, something we can’t ignore
We can’t back down
We’ll never let them change us
We’re going to make it now
What are we waiting for...
What are we waiting for...

Nobody else needs to know

""Go for mine, and run down the line""

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Rollie (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, ""Holy moley!""
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I know, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lone, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

[Verse 3: Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the vest, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical BUCK BUCK, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Verse 4: Ill Al Skratch]
Ayo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy with stakes

[Verse 5: Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fate is fatal when my heat made a sound
Now, how did I relate what's gonna fall
When my niggas made the fucking final call

[Chorus: Ill Al Skratch]
It ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You best believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, ""Please give me room, yo step aside""
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Verse 7: Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the guard on my side
And the guard S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
""Yo, throw the wax on"" ""How many emcees must get dissed""

[Verse 8: Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pave, ending 'em meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Verse 9: Wish Bone]
Living the psycho path so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Verse 10: Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once a
Gain enough to pick a defender
They try to contend us, see, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother, while smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Verse 11: Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, with, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um
With a me tech'll slip up one on the popos, Bone, Bone
Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up
Get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up

We don't got time to waste time
So I'm gonna do it while I can

That make life worth living, life worth living

You told me some time ago
You don't know what I've been thinking of
And you say that I should let you go
I tell you that it's you that I am dreaming of
Cause I feel your heart beat if I breath
Every single look you define me
I will never shut down my beating
I will show the world what I've got
All I wanna do is surround you
Make you understand that without you
Every time you touch me, I'm dying
Every single night, oh, every single day, oh
Every night I feel us colliding
Trying to let go, but I'm blinded
Tell me what I do is enough
I am into you, oh, I'm so into you!
All I wanna do is surround you
Make you understand that without you
Every time you touch me, I'm dying

When you say that we might had enough
Raindrops feels like needle on my head

To walk with you in one heart still longing
I will show you why we belong here
I will never give you up!

635,23998,"Me, Myself & I",G-Eazy,"[Behind The Scenes]

Scene 1: Car/Stairs
(00:00 - 00:27)
Gerald has just finished his worldwide tour and has finally got home to take some rest days. Finally getting some alone time with his lover but when they go back to their own house, he is met with a not much of a surprise after she promise's it will just be the two of them.DialogueEffect on the audience




Scene 2: Surprise
(00:27 - 01:00)
Surprise look some people turned out to his birthday. This a important scene for the video to keep taking place as you see Gerald split off from his normal self. You can see Bebe Rexha coming in with the hook flowing over Gerald's visual uncomfortableness in his own party.

When the director approached him on this movie, Gerald took a liking to this one surprisingly enough that this was actually a true story, that he didn't want to go out on his birthday. You can see partial of the events documented in 'The Rise (Episode 2)', G-Eazy's web series before releasing his album When It's Dark Out.DialogueEffect on the audience




Scene 3: The Walk
01:00 - 01:30
From camera's from the paparazzi with everything he does needing to be documented to, saying he is getting knocked on the shoulder for being a white rapper. This scene is a metaphor for his journey in his career, whether it's going through different stages, walking through the party seeing the different sides of it. With the lighting switching as he is moving through to try get to the outside for some fresh air from the pressure of the game.




Scene 4: Backdrop/Rexha
(01:30 - 01:50)
Bebe originally wrote the hook of the song on piano and gave it into G as a demo, he took it a board and worked with her on the song and chopped it up and she was so good they didn't have to change it at all. Bebe in the video adds a eerie yet happier place of being content to be by herself at times in her all black outfit.



Scene 5: The Party
(01:50 - 02:06)
The inside of the party versus the outside of the party mainly focusing on the lighting of the screen symbolising the contrast in him. Showing the contrast of the allure of the party with multiple women to him with just one when he isn't the villainous side.




Scene 6: Balcony Scene
(02:26 - 02:25)
To get some time with his french girl from the start, to maybe take some molly with their alcohol. As a second Young Gerald sits on the edge of the angled balcony over looking the city and reflecting upon the party in the face of himself with his girl.




Scene 7: Happy Birthday
(02:46 - 03:00)
Gerald gets a big cake for his 26th birthday while they all sing happy birthday to him. Looking uncomfortable as ever but still thankful of where he is.




Scene 8: Bathroom Monologue
(03:00 - 03:38)
After being sung happy birthday we see Gerald recluse in the bathroom to get away from the party the lines. Arguably the best part of this music video has multiple Gerald's fight each other with their different personality with separate issues.Dialogue


Scene 9: Bottom floor girl
(03:40 - 03:53)
Gerald looks at this girl from outside before hopping in his car. With a stern face of disappointment he puts his phone away most likely texting his girlfriend of the time, knowing that he is going to go down on this girl he is just creating problems with his girl.




Scene 10: Car
(03:53 - 04:12)
Trying to stay awake under all the drugs, blocking out all the voices and trying not to fully loose it he drives off into the night.




Scene 11: Everything is a Blur Now
(04:12 - 04:30)
Going through the subtle Beats by Dre sponsorship and mixing up the partying mixed with the fast cutting creates for some interesting and intense shots.


Scene 12: Speeding Through the City
(04:46 - 05:04)
Whether it's riding through the city down 60 foreign whip he has found speeding is a way to escape his mind as it gives a thrill. At this exact frame in the ""When It's Dark Out Trailer"" you can see him and his crew speed odometer resting at a high 102mph.



Scene 13: Montage of the Tours
(05:04 - 05:22)
From the ""These Things Happen"" album release Gerald went on a two legged tour all over the world. These clips that flash through the eyes of the video are complications of some of the highlights from the youtube series.




Scene 14: Police Chase
(05:22 - 05:34)
After accelerating faster giving a similar vibe to his ""You Got Me"" music video where you can hear distinct police sirens in the back ground.




Scene 15: The Crash
(05:34 - 05:40)
This crash suits in well with the idea of ""leaving a beautiful carrcass"" behind so after a night of speeding and being chased by police till we have a infamous James Dean crash.



Scene 16: Outro
(05:40 - 05:49)
His humble beginning comes back to him. He realized what he wanted to do from the start, but as he rose to fame, he found that it has many consequences.Dialogue

640,23988,More Cowbell,D.O.D,"No, not today
Can't agree; why do we endure all this suffering?
When we're to blame
Comes to me so easily; life is the discovering

Gone out to sea; I swim alone
No life guard to save my soul
The waves high, the water cold
And where it ends I'll never know

There's too much fantasy; back to reality
It's such a waste of time just waiting for an answer
There is no escape from our mortality
See what you want to see; entropy's my only master

Now is the day
Everything you can see; time's a singularity
Go all the way
Don't believe what you see; there will be no stopping me

Gone out to sea; I swim alone
No life guard to save my soul
The waves high, the water cold
And where it ends I'll never know

There's too much fantasy; back to reality
It's such a waste of time just waiting for an answer
There is no escape from our mortality
See what you want to see; entropy's my only master

Entropy's my only master

There's too much fantasy; back to reality
It's such a waste of time just waiting for an answer
There is no escape from our mortality
See what you want to see; entropy's my only master

But I find when I'm alone, it gets so hard to breathe
And I, I, and I

Shouldn't apologize for just existing
Shouldn't apologize for just being me
Trying to hide behind all my distractions
Okay 'til the quiet comes

642,23980,Our Nation,Dada Life,"In the beginning there was sound
And sound had a groove
And from this groove came the groove of all grooves
And one day it was boldly declared
""Let there be Dada!""
And Dada Life was born
We are all, you see, the creators
And this is our land
And in our land there is only happy face music
And you see, happy face music is a universal language spoken and understood by all
You see, happy face music is a feeling that no one can understand really, unless you're living the dada life
Dada is the uncontrollable desire to rage with happiness
And as we told you before, this is our land, and this is our music
Now some of you may wonder
""Who is Dada and what does it this Dada does?""
Dada is the one who can bring nations together under one roof
In one place: Our place, our home
We are all citizens
It doesn't matter who you are
It don't make a difference in our land
And this is Dada land
Dada land, Dada land, Dada land, Dada land
Dada land, Dada land, Dada land, Dada land
Dada land, Dada land, Dada land, Dada land
Dada land, Dada land, Dada land, Dada land
Dada land, Dada land, Dada land, Dada land
