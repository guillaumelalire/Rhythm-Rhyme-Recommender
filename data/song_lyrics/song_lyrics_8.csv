0,24038,Starlight,Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"[Verse 1]
Hold a moment in time
And look to the skies
When we are frozen in light
Not a second goes by
Is it a waking dream holding me?
You never really know till you know
In the blink of an eye, hearts will unite

[Chorus]
We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die right here in your arms
We are one caught here
Under the starlight, starlight
'Cause tonight we found heaven in the dark

[Verse 2]
A silhouette in my mind
It's just you and I
And as the starlight shines
Our bodies outline
It's so natural, unbreakable
Won't ever let you go, let you go
Your hand in my hand
Here till the end

[Chorus]
We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die right here in your arms
We are one caught here
Under the starlight, starlight
'Cause tonight we found heaven in the dark

[Bridge]
As a new day rises
Lost in our embrace
We are one

[Chorus]
We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die right here in your arms
We are one caught here
Under the starlight, starlight
'Cause tonight we found heaven in the dark

2,24008,Be Together,Michael Aasen,"You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You see my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
I remember we were driving driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling
I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs
You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
You leave tonight or live and die this way

I don't wanna shed another tear
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna start another war

Sick of the bullshit and all of the lies
I just gotta forget you somehow

Sick of the bullshit and all of the lies

When I was with you time started to fly
Now you're gone and I don't know why, but bye
And now that we're strangers with those memories
The things we had drifted overseas
Now I'm moving on out of your life

Every secret that we shared, I will never forget

All I have is my misery
A couple bucks and some cigarettes
A perfect billboard model just kissed my cheek
That one morning the city slept
I've got a dirty mind but my shoes are clean
I don't look away 'cause I choose to see
The chain around your neck isn't jewellery
You ain't fooling me, 'cause I…
Never had no shades to cry behind
Never found the place I tried to find
If I told you so then I'd be lyin'
I was lost and made a change of course
But I'm still afraid to change of course
Someone told me when it rains it pours

[Hook]
I've been thinking of sunshine (sunshine)
Through the pain and strife
I've been thinking of sunshine
Through the coldest days of life

[Verse 2]
All I have is my history
Strolled the streets when a stranger passed
He spoke and when I got to hear his story
I realized my life is not so bad
I used to have a job till they fired me
I thought I was the person I strived to be
Now everything is gone but that's fine with me
'Cause my mind is free, and I…
Never had no shades to cry behind
Never found the place I tried to find
If I told you so then I'd be lyin'
I was lost and made a change of course
But I'm still afraid to change of course
Someone told me when it rains it pours

Through the pain and strife
I've been thinking of sunshine
Through the coldest days of life

[Verse 3]
I never took nothing from no one except bad advise
Some of my homies never overcame the setback of life
Like life has taught me two things
Life has taught me two things
Tie your own shoestrings
Sometimes we go through things
I've done things, I do things I'm not always proud of
But I smile trough the struggle just as if I won the lotto
I know reality is hard, sometimes it's easy to dream
It's only when you close your eyes that you can see what I've seen
See what I mean?

I've been thinking of sunshine (sunshine)
Through the pain and strife
I've been thinking of sunshine
Through the coldest days of life

I am drawn between polarities but gravity won't take my control
I am running out into the wild without a destination or goal

Why wait for a happy ending
When all you need is the happy hours
All you need is the happy hours

I'm humming on a melody that's firming loud inside of a song
Dont set a limit, set a goal and learn to walk before you can crawl
I'm running out into the wild without a destination or goal
All I need is clarity but you don't seem to get me at all

Why wait for a happy ending

On the subway home
I lost you in a fever

22,24017,Pong Dance,Vigiland,"[Verse 1]
Been away for college, was the baddest geek around
He's been doing everything but make his parents proud
He tried his best to study hard but still, he got too drunk
Won lots of beer pong tournaments but still, he had to flunk

[Bridge]
His ex-girlfriend got a girlfriend
His barbie tried a female Ken
But when the white ball hits the red cup
He's the baddest fucker in the frat club

[Chorus]
Then he does the pong dance
The the the the pong dance
He does the pong dance
The the the the pong dance

[Verse 2]
He'd never touched a cigarette, but tried to smoke a joint
He coughed and soon he felt regret, just screaming ""What's the point?!""
And every time he saw this girl his face would turn to red
Even though he told the guys he got her into bed

[Bridge]
But when you see him at the table
He turns out to be rather stable
And when the white ball hits the red cup
He's the baddest fucker in the frat club

[Outro]
Then he does the pong dance
Then he does the pong dance

Give me reasons to doubt

Throw your sticks and your stones
Go break all of my bones

Shoot me down you fire away, away

Push me down to the ground

Say what you want to say

But I’m here to stay
No you can’t get to me

Shoot me down you fire away, away

24,24039,You Are My Summer,La+ch,"[Verse 1]
Makes me think of grapefruit juice
Trampolines and ice cream soup
Spitting watermelon seeds
Grass stains on my favourite jeans
Jumping rope and riding bikes
Playing hide and seek at night
Farmer's tans and swimming pools
But most of all I think of you, you, you

[Chorus]
You are my summer!
You are my summer!
You are my summer!

[Post-Chorus]
We run our sticks along the chain link fence like
Dum, du-dum, du-dum, dum, du-dum, dum, du-dum

[Verse 2]
Sipping from my Slurpee straw
I love things your germs are on
Swimming in our underwear
Bubblegum stuck in my hair
Stick our toes into the sand
Catching toads inside our hands
Sleeping bags under the moon
But most of all I think of you, you, you
You are my summer!

[Outro]
We run our sticks along the chain link fence like
Dum, du-dum, du-dum, dum, du-dum, dum, du-dum

We run our sticks along the chain link fence like

We run our sticks along the chain link fence like

Gimme that sunshine in the dark
And it's the remedy
Gimme that love that fills the heart
This is what you do to me

I, I have been walking with shadows
But they make the sun go low
Then you showed me how to leave the past behind
Now I'm not afraid to let it go

27,24034,Renaissance,Steve James,"[Verse 1]
You left me in the worst way
Heart torn, leaving blood stains
All over the tablecloth
And I could never scrub them out
But I won't let you haunt me
All the scars on my body
They won't keep me far from love
And you won't see me fall apart

[Pre-Chorus]
​Cause I turned so cold
And I thought I’d never make it
I could feel my pulses fading

[Chorus]
Shed a tear for the love we've lost
Gotta look for a brand new start
You got me dreaming of a renaissance (renaissance)
A renaissance
A renaissance

[Verse 2]
You left me in the worst way
On the floor, screaming your name
But I'm sick of always saying no
The way everything unfolds
The time we had
Was golden but I look back
Wishing that I could have known
It'd be easier to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
​Cause I turned so cold
And I thought I’d never make it
I could feel my pulses fading

[Chorus]
Shed a tear for the love we've lost
Gotta look for a brand new start
You got me dreaming of a renaissance
A renaissance
A renaissance

All the scars on my body
All the scars on my body
All the scars on my body

Shed a tear for the love we've lost

31,24020,Until You Were Gone,The Chainsmokers,"[Verse 1: Emily Warren]
Thought that I'd be better off if I were on my own
I tried to put my finger on the moment we went wrong
But the taste turned bitter, so I pulled the trigger
Not so easy to move on, I guess I should have known

[Chorus: Emily Warren]
Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over
Ever since I left you, I've been tryna get you back
And it keeps gettin' worse
I'm burning on the inside and the truth is that I
Didn't know how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone

[Verse 2: Emily Warren]
I was always told that only time would heal the pain
Yet even though it's been so long it still hurts just the same
Yet now I'm finding, that the break was binding
I take back everything I said, oh, won't you just come home

[Chorus: Emily Warren]
Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over
Ever since I left you, I've been tryna get you back
And it keeps gettin' worse
I'm burning on the inside and the truth is that I
Didn't know how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone

32,24032,Be As You Are,Mike Posner,"[Verse 1]
Virginia Woolf and poetry
No one seemed to notice me
Being young was getting so old
Cheap beer and cigarettes
Life was like a movie set
And I seemed to be given no role

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 18
I cried to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

[Chorus]
""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
Life is not always a comfortable ride
Everybody's got scars that they hide
And everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah
Just be as you are""

[Verse 2]
They played me on the radio
And everything was changing, so
I thought I was all the way grown
But I can still remember in that cold November
When I realized I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 22
I cried to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

[Chorus 2]
""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are (Just be as you are)""
Be as you are (Whoa)
Be as, be as you are (Be as you are)
Be as you are
(Be as you are) Be as, be as you are

[Bridge]
If I'm speaking truthfully
I'm not who I used to be
And I know some people might laugh
'Cause my music doesn't sound the same
And my head's no longer shaved
I'm worried if I'm on the right path

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 26
I spoke to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

[Chorus 2]
""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are (Be as you are)""

Squad goin' up
Nobody flippin' packs now
I just did three in a row
Them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think
How we had the club going up

Workin' Monday night
On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least three thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think

Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't

Uh-oh, dancing past the point of no return
Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned

Ställer mig i hallen tills jag fattar vad som hänt
Får jag ens ha kvar dig som min vän?

Sitter här på sängen tills du be mig att gå hem
Letar efter nå't att säga som kan ändra allt

55,24054,The Great Escape,Noréll,"[Verse 1]
When you're getting your own way
When you care but calculate
When you hunt that fleeting
Hope it's hallow
When you're only chasing you
Nothing's clear but here's a clue
If I get out your way
You'd follow

[Chorus]
You're just the way you are
Inside, I'm on fire
You're know the great escape
Still I'm drawn into your night
When you can't do anything
But know what secret wait
To keep a hold on us
We must believe in

[Verse 2]
This angst will grow upon you
Like thunder deep within
When you fight you break bones
And beacons
And the sun will set again
Like nothing's ever changed
When I'm out of your way
I hunt you
The world is caving in
You set a fuss about the sins
We're buried in the ground
Now, leave it
Another ramble on
Out on this road so long
Silence, all alone
The world we could've known

[Chorus]
You're just the way you are
Inside, I'm on fire
You're know the great escape
Still I'm drawn into your night
When you can't do anything
But know what secret wait

Nothing here to keep us safe
The players play their, play their games
Nothing here to keep us safe
The players play their, play their games
Nothing here to keep us safe
The players play their, play their games
But if you look into the truth
I swear we'll tame my violent feud
Nothing here to keep us safe
The players play their, play their games
But if you're open the truth
I swear we'll tame my violent feud

You're just the way you are
Inside, I'm on fire
You're know the great escape
Still I'm crawling into your night
When you can't do anything

56,24072,Torn,Chad Cooper,"[Verse 1]
I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well you couldn't be that man I adored

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You don't seem to know, don't seem to care
What your heart is for
No, I don't know him anymore
There's nothin' where we used to lie
Conversation has run dry
That's what's going on

[Chorus]
Nothing's fine, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
Wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

[Verse 2]
So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins and now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't care, I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things

[Chorus]
That I can't touch, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

[Bridge]
There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
And that's what is goin' on

[Chorus]
No, nothin's right, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

I don´t know if I was screaming or I got to hide
All my demons are closer
Lying blind but my eyes are open wide
From the darkness, to the light, to the place I die
Wake me up when it´s over

I am off the edge and now I am somewhere in oblivion
And my walls are breaking through
Out of my head and now I am somewhere in oblivion
All because of you

Came to me, find the shadows to reset my mind
Right me up now I feel like I´m doing time

Only she knows how I feel, like everything is real
I´m sitting next to her
We never stop believing, believing and dreaming

Wrapped up in each other

61,24057,What We Got,Pontus,"[Verse 1: DreamzOne]
16 bars I spit, and it's all about this weed
Getting blunts, getting 20's, maybe even an O-Z
Waking up in the morning, loading up another bowl
People say it's bad for me, but I say it's good for the soul
Smoking on the reefa like my name was Wiz Khalifa
My girl be Mary Jane, how nice of you to meet her
Take another hit, then I pass it to the left
Never fuck up the rotation, might end up getting checked
Who's got ends? Is always my question
Grab the swisher, grab a lighter, light it up and start inhaling
Muthafuckas always coasting off the green that we be roasting
Hocus Pocus, laying low, yeah, that's pretty hopeless
When you're with us, know 1 thing, we're always fucking high
Since the day I hit it once, I felt like it's my life
Don't ever say it's bad if you've never fucking tried
And it's roll up big blunts 'til the day I die

[Hook (x2): DreamzOne]
Roll up big blunts, it's always what we got
Take hits, load bowls, 'til our eyes drop
Pinetrees, grean leaves, yeah it don't stop
Take a hit and pass it on until it's all gone

[Verse 2: Lil Fiendz]
Eyes low, real chill feeling, having nice dreams
Smoking on some sticky that would feel like you made the time freeze
Whether pipe or blunt, I don't give a fuck
I'mma light it up, no Mersh up over here, strictly Fire bruh
Getting high as fuck, watch me as I break the tree down
Like a lumberjack, the clicking of a lighter, I love that sound
Haha, if you ain't got a dollar, you ain't gonna hit it, bitch
Shit, you're tripping homeboy, pass the chips and dip
Never fucking with no drug you snort or use a needle
I'm with my people hotboxing, don't even let smoke out a keyhole
It's funny how me and Mary Jane would break up
But I'm just so used to her love that in the end we'd always make up
Ha, and yes, I'm so high, never getting vertigo
Ain't nothing better than to smoke some weed and murk some flows
Never smoking solo, it ain't no fun without my crew
It's me, Laced Oner & DreamzOne, ayo tell them how we do
Yeah

Eh

[Verse 1]
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

I always hear, always hear them talkin'
Talkin' 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Sayin' that I hurt you, but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could've really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinkin' 'bout you
It's a shame (Shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu

Clothesline, sunsets
Sky blue, barn red
Wind chimes, front porch
Good dogs, wood floors

And miles and miles of John Deere green
Freedom far as I can see
A road to run and room to breathe
That's who I am and I'll always be

Caught up in the country
The only way I wanna be
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends

With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Caught up in the country

Not a soul up ahead
And nothing behind
There's a desert in my blood
And a storm in your eyes
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all

And I forget the pain

And my key on your chain
Am I the king of nothing at all?

You and I we're walking
Through the emptiness
Oh, my heart is a mess
Is it the only defense
Against the wilderness

Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

Not a soul in the road
Not a star in the sky

If you don't have trust
Ain't nothing left of us
This is the exodus
They're just testing us
They can't flex with us
They can't mess with us
They can't mess with us

Oh, through the wilderness
How come even together
There can be loneliness?
Oh, our heart's a mess
But it's our only defense
To brave the wilderness

Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine

One foot in front of the other
In the so-called land of the free
One foot in front of the other

92,24143,Find You,Nick Jonas,"[Verse 1]
I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you
I chase the words that keep falling out your mouth
You got a logic I'll never figure out
If I could hold you then I'd never put you down
But I never really know just where to find you

[Chorus]
Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I-
Try, try, try, but I, but I-
Try, try, try, but I-
But I never really know just where to find you

[Verse 2]
You think you know how to get under my skin
It's good for now but it's never permanent
Knock on the door but there's no one listening
And I never really know just where to find you
You look for love but you never really try
You say it's not but it's always on your mind
Keep chasing gold but you lose a silver line
But I never really know just where to find you

[Chorus]
Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I-
Try, try, try, but I, but I-
Try, try, try, but I-
But I never really know just where to find you

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm chasing a feeling
Maybe I don't even need it
Maybe you're looking for me tonight, tonight
I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you

[Chorus]
Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I-
Try, try, try, but I, but I-
Try, try, try, but I-
But I never really know just where to find you

Let me tell you how it happened
I wasn't looking for someone that night
No, I was never a believer
That you could fall in love at the first sight

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne, Lennon Stella, Both]
But all of a sudden
(We loved and got lost in the moment)
All of a sudden
(She's gone in the flash of a light)
I never was looking, hmm
I'll be looking for the rest of my life

[Chorus: Liam Payne & Lennon Stella]
We took a Polaroid
You signed your name upon it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again
We took a Polaroid
Captured the look in your eyes
It's only a matter of time
Before it starts fading

[Verse 2: Lennon Stella]
Oh, no
Mmm
Was it my imagination?
I could've swore I saw someone like you
A thousand people at the station
And in a second, you slipped out of view

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne, Lennon Stella, Both]
Then all of a sudden
(I loved and got lost in the moment)
All of a sudden
(She's gone in the blink of an eye)
I never was looking, hmm
I'll be looking for the rest of my life

[Chorus: Liam Payne & Lennon Stella]
We took a Polaroid
You signed your name upon it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again
We took a Polaroid
Captured the look in your eyes
It's only a matter of time
Before it starts fading

[Bridge: Liam Payne & Lennon Stella]
We were dancing without moving
All my friends were leaving me behind
I didn't wanna catch a feeling
But there was something in that flashing light

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne, Lennon Stella, Both]
Then all of a sudden
(I loved and got lost in the moment)
All of a sudden
(She's gone in the blink of an eye)
I never was looking, hmm
I'll be looking for the rest of my life

[Chorus: Liam Payne & Lennon Stella]
We took a Polaroid (we did)
You signed your name upon it (you did)
I put it in my wallet (I did)
Hoping I'd see your face again
We took a Polaroid (we did)
Captured the look in your eyes (you did)
It's only a matter of time (I did)

We took a Polaroid
You signed your name upon it
I put it in my wallet

After we were high and the love dope died it was you

That it feels like we chose this blindly

Last night
I might have messed it up again

Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there, and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go
I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go

Let's leave things the way they were
You'll stay with me like a lullaby

We both know that deep down you feel the same
Hard to say it's over

105,24133,Without You,Avicii,"[Verse 1]
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

106,24119,Growing Pains,Alessia Cara,"[Intro]
You're on your own, kid
You are

[Verse 1]
Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet? Hmm
A short leash and a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad, ""Now, don't you overreact""
So I just hold my breath
Don't know why I can't see the sun when young should be fun (Fun)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

[Verse 2]
Try to mend what's left of my content incomprehension
As I take on the stress of the mess that I've made
Don't know if I even care for ""grown"" if it's just alone, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

[Outro]
Starting to look like Ms. Know-It-All can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind
I cry more than I want to admit
But I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face
No Band-Aids for the growing pains (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
No, no, no Band-Aids for the growing pains

I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read and repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me a...
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna call and you not answer
Never see your face light up my phone
Never see you singing ""Tiny Dancer""
Everytime my head hurts, everytime I'm low

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
'Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Everything about you uncomplicated
Here with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me praying

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

Don't leave me a...

Don't you ever leave me

Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

108,24139,Lonely Together,Avicii,"[Verse 1]
It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

[Verse 2]
Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (Oh)
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined (Oh)
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time (Oh)

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know

Hanging with your brother
Wishin' that I was your bottle

Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and

Never be the same now, now

Thought that I could chase you with the cold evenin'

And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)

You could break my heart in two

Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)

We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it

But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

And high and dry, the desert wind

Mmm, that nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

130,24160,Perfect,Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""

[Verse 2]
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

[Pre-Chorus]
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

[Bridge]
No, no, no
Mm, no, no

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

132,24151,Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,"[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

I wanna rock with somebody (Woo, yeah)
I wanna take shots with somebody (Shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (Come on, come on)

The seat, trays upright
On time
Catch a late night red eye
Last chance to board
Boy, it's been a ride
But our destinations
They don't align

I don't need you to follow
It took a minute for me to realize
You're not in my tomorrow

You stay grounded, I'm a keep climbin'
35,000 high
Final destination unknown
But no way to deny

Watch me take to the sky

I'm long gone
So wish me safe travels
Gonna just let it
All unravel

Gathered my things
And got on this plane
Time to soar away from you

You know it's for the best

Although I want to cores
Our love it keeps me satisï¬ed
It keeps me holding on
You know our love it is so strong
Nobody can call it wrong

I'm feeling your smile, your love
The way you hold my hand
Expressing our inner hearts
While walking in the sand
It feels like I am flying high
I want to touch the sky
When I'm with you, our love shines through
I'll never say goodbye

Our love it keeps me satisfied
It keeps me holding on
You know our love it is so strong
Nobody can call it wrong

Forget about the times feeling blue
The time is now for me and you
We can buy a boat and sail away
A brand new life a brand new day

[Chorus]
So what are we gonna do with all this love?
And in 12 years time, will we smile when we think about us? Oh
Our timing is a mess, but that don't mean that it means less
And if we have to say goodbye ’cause it’s for the best
So what are we gonna do with all this love? Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
With all this love
With all this love
Oh, with all this love
With all this love
So what are we gonna do with all this love?
With all this love
So what are we gonna do with all this love?
With all this love
Oh-ooh, with all this love

156,24154,September Song,JP Cooper,"[Verse 1]
Our love was strong as a lion
Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron
You and I
Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk till the morning
You and I

[Pre-Chorus]
We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating, had it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station
Passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers
You and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Still, I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating, got it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
I hear that September song, that I'm singing along
Thinking about you and me, oh, what a melody

[Bridge]
And as the years go by
You will still be my, be my (September song)
You are my (September song)

[Chorus]
You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song
I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us

Seemed so far from who he had been
All my fears out of hand
All the flowers that I couldn't bring

How can I make it on my own?
Without the one that could carry me home?

As dawn began to break
And our hearts just lost the race
A storm drift in from and outside
When his eyes set for a goodbye

Birds got quiet, hid in trees
Even tough men got haunted by tears
World got hammered, turned to stone
With Autumn wind blows
Came thundering down

And our hearts just lost the race

Went our own ways
But darling, hold me
Let’s forget the space
Between our bodies
Between our shades

It’s kind of scary
Getting lost in you
Cause when I lose my power
I lose myself, too
And I can’t afford this
But I still need you

When you come close
I push you away
I don’t want to harm you
But you can’t stay
Still I need you here
Here with me

I just know that I don't
Know what i want
Though I try my best and
Maybe i’m the only one
Who fights for something
Where we belong

All I see is closed doors
In front of me
I don't give a shit though
I just wanna be
Near to your body
Near to me

Forgot the crash, the burn, and only saw you

Wish I knew that I didn’t stand a chance

Right when I fell, I lost everything
In my heart, in my head, in my soul
I couldn’t tell, it was only a dream
Didn’t mean anything at all, all, all
Promises in the dark made to my heart
But you knew it was nothing right from the start
It was a lie, it was a fairy tale, the shortest one
It was a hit and ru, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh, uh, uh, hit and run
Hit and ru, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh, uh, uh, hit and run

Even though I know I’m better off without you now
So I’ll learn to let you go oo woah oo woah

Niggas always talk breezy till the steel come out
And slugs rip through their gums and their grill come out
Motherfuck you and fuck your mans
If I don't clap you in the dome

Puff purple instead of chocolate
Stay from around chumps and cowards cause they gossip
And I'm a stay on the corner like stop signs
With a pack of them creamy colored rocks and the Glock nine
When you speaking of the hardest nigga
Bring hood's name up
D Block bitch, we about to have the game chained up

And your towel can't dry you when the dumdums shower you
Your mad because your garbage and your lyrics is boring
And your whip was made that same year you was born in

And me? I'm just getting off in court
I could make sure your coffin bought
Why would you mention a burner?
There is a difference between rapping and attempting to murder
Talking the shit you living and talking the shit you heard of
You said fuck Larceny?
What is you crazy, bitch?
Before you walk the streets, here's a few safety tips
Watch who you speaking bout and watch who you speaking to
The cats you speaking bout could show you what the heat could do
A respirator is what you'll be breathing through
And you got beef with who that you need toast
The closest you came to beef was meat loaf
When we pose with bats and pea coats
Y'all niggas better be close

[Verse 3: Cam]
To fuck with Cam, y'all bitches better hope and dream
Every gun that I own got a scope and beam
When I approach the scene shake the dice, rook the team
Best bitch on the east coast since Queen
Latifah, buy reefer, fly diva
Ride deeper, four pound bump louder than five speaker
Spit fire, hot lava flow
Don't get it twisted, I'm not one of them Prada ho's
Catch me in Escada clothes, with a lot of dough
That's not mine, it's his
I need a lot more to live
You got to get the king before the kid
How you think a bitch like me afford to live motherfucker?

[Styles]
That's a bad bitch, Shiz you a bad ass nigga, It's the younger generation, killing y'all, Lock, get busy on these niggas

[Verse 4: Lock]
Hey look, I'm trying to sell mad gravy
So I get birds from my crew and make Erykah Badu my ""Bag Lady""
You that crazy? Squeeze, I know you ain't spitting shells
Your hand shake so much it shows up on the Richter scale
I made the huskiest niggas look like they had sickle cell
I don't just sell bricks, dog I got a bitch for sale
So let me find the nigga that hating Lock
No coffin, he get buried in the refrigerator box
God damn, I'm a hot man
I'm telling you straight up, I got my weight up, Jacob
Call my wrists Roxanne
Cause if I wore it in a dark room
You and your man would hate it, I'mma look animated like a cartoon
Bottom line, I'm telling you that you ain't fucking with me
Hard, nobody guards, you want a shot, come and get me
I'm not a sucker, nor is any nigga running with me
And why are y'all balling with wheels if they under fifty
Nigga

[Verse 5: Rockstar]
Lock and blocks the motto
Got more slow than Dr. Zhivago
Same mind state that makes a poem rock in Chicago
But I don't get my gangster from movies
I'm a rockstar, 5 star teles, running with gangsters and groupies
Come through and leave a voice sick
Cause my F-type steers with a joystick
I'm the heart in my era
Listen, I lead an artistic life
Paint pictures with my actions, ain't no margin for error
My innate features, leave niggas dismayed, speechless
And please don't mistake weakness for kindness
I fuck with old timers
So don't make me forget that you real and catch Alzheimers
Motherfucking hoes never I spoil them
Remember, I'm known to break a bitch for reckless eyeballing
The top dog, nigga, I'm the bare truth
You want to get math?
Nigga I'm the square root
The Rockstar

[Verse 6: Cassidy]
I got mean stash
You seen Cass get his thug on
Strip my bitch, we kiss and get our hug on
She what I put drugs on and get my grub on
And dog, when you park your car, put your club on
The next cat I put the snub on
Ima clap the gat till it get too hot, and that's with gloves on
Y'all love drawing, you should go to an art school
I get my club on with the glow in the dark jewels
Trees in my shoes, polo in the dark blues
And I spark tools that the po and the narcs use
Fuckers, y'all stupid or something
What's the point in pulling out your joint if you ain't shootin at nothing
Dude, fronting will get you banged in the face
If you have braces then you know how the banger will taste
I'm near anything pertaining to cake
And Just copped the blue lighting with the rectangular face
Easy

[Styles]
Easy niggas, matter of fact fuck that go hard
Cass' show these niggas how you built
Grab your guns and bust off, my nigga

[Verse 7: Cassidy]
Yeah it's Cassidy bitch, get the name clear
I'm what you lame steer got the game scared
Buy 'caine by the square, sell it by the o
I run through snow like a reindeer
The cool kid, got the coke heads nose red like Rudolf
I grind on the strip so hard I got blue balls
I'd rather knock a q off then get blew off
That's how I stay on my toes like my shoes off
You dudes are soft, really bitches like Ra Paul
When's it's war I move out like U-hauls
I'm a true boss
I send eight balls to the corner
My strip like a pool hall
And I ball like I been in the sport
My trigger finger itching like it got genital warts
Don't play around with him boy (why's that)
Cause Cass is a pain in the ass like hemorrhoids
Faggot!

Yeah
You know this

[Verse 1]
Went to school to learn, I had to leave
Knew exactly what I had to be
They try to break me and take my dream
But they can’t shake me now, I’m out and I’m free
Told me I could never have success
Told me I would never make progress
Next to the rest they would treat me as less
Forget your tests, I’m way more blessed
My way was right from the start, straight from the heart
Who you are is a part of the future
People try to control you, hold you
The score in the goal’s where they can’t own you
Who’d have known I’d have been who I am
Life with the struggles and troubles made me who I am
God had a plan, I ran when you walked
Now you’re stuck in the sand and now look where I am

[Chorus]
Never going down
Never thought I could do this
Better hear me now
Yeah, come and hear me now
I don’t got to shout
Nah, I kill ‘em when I prove this
Better hear me now
Yeah, y’all better hear me now

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, ay
Na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Little girl, don’t cry, dry the tears from your eyes
Spread your wings, one day you’ll fly
Little girl, have faith, be patient and wait
Don’t you know these things take time?
They don’t understand what a genius demands
What they got on their hands, worthwhile
They don’t see who you are, nothin’ that is so hot
Do it, stop, sit back and smile
Practice it perfect, don’t let ‘em say it ain’t worth it
Get your rewards, you deserve it
Haters will curse it, nervous the fact you determined
You earned it, now they feel worthless
Damn, have no regrets
Laugh at the threats ‘cause you know they gon’ lose their bets
Go, take due respect, glad that I left
Life ain’t a game, it’s a test

[Chorus]
Never going down
Never thought I could do this
Better hear me now
Yeah, come and hear me now
I don’t got to shout
Nah, I kill ‘em when I prove this
Better hear me now
Yeah, y’all better hear me now

Na, na, ay
Na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 3]
Where will I be in 10 years’ time?
Music, movies, my own clothes line
Last in the class, but writin’ my rhymes
While you sat at the back of the welfare line
Where am I at? What I have right now?
Sitcom signed with my album out
You still livin’ in your parents’ house
Tryin’ to lose the addiction you found
They tried to say I was unrealistic
Misdirected, no perspective
I tried to tell them, they ain’t interested
My way, your way, tried it, test it
Who did the best thing? How few is the math?
You all at school ‘cause I choose my path
I’ma laugh, you sad with the life that you have
But I can’t look back, I’m havin’ a blast

[Chorus]
Never going down
Never thought I could do this
Better hear me now
Yeah, come and hear me now
I don’t got to shout
Nah, I kill ‘em when I prove this
Better hear me now

I've been fighting this world on my own
Healing my unbroken bones
I've been sitting on my own throne
But it's been in an empty home
You've got the same type of energy
We could make memories, just you and me
On the same level together
No matter the weather and all things between

Do you wanna be my ride or die?
Be sitting on my passenger's side
I'll be, buy me your time, partners in crime
Give me crazy love, there's one of a kind

Kiss me on the way to the top of the hill
Take me like a bunch of pills
Better throttle up we got time to kill
Always giving me the chills
Hostile my heart, you can take it apart
Do what you want, it's yours
Give it a shot if you want it or not
You got the key to the door

You opened my heart and I closed it

Guess I'm holdin' out for another day
How long, how long
Tell me how long, how long?

Subiste una montaña, estás satisfecha?
Mientras te paras en la cima
Ya quieres hacer esto

Tal vez realmente no necesito sentirmе satisfecho
Tal vez es un rеgalo que paso todo este tiempo

El calor del verano en las canciones que escribes
Tal vez es un regalo que no pude reconocer

Thought that I'd be better off if I were on my own
I tried to put my finger on the moment we went wrong
But the taste turned bitter, so I pulled the trigger
Not so easy to move on, I guess I should have known

[Chorus: Emily Warren]
Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over
Ever since I left you, I've been tryna get you back
And it keeps gettin' worse
I'm burning on the inside and the truth is that I
Didn't know how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone

[Verse 2: Emily Warren]
I was always told that only time would heal the pain
Yet even though it's been so long it still hurts just the same
Yet now I'm finding, that the break was binding
I take back everything I said, oh, won't you just come home

Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer

Looking insane
Better not mess with her mood

She's a hot mess
So I like to make her mad
She's lights me up, but I can take the heat

And I'm only here to let her burn free

Don't get her started
When she's a pistol
Give her somе time on her own
Don't hang around her
Whеn she's a missile
Give her some room to explore
And it's not that she is some kind of pain
It's just that she's too crazy to tame

A lady should be classy in the streets
She's gotta know the book of love from front to back

But none of this is real, it's all a lie
And for those who can't speak, we can testify!

Said, it's your own body, you can do what you want!
Said, it's your own body, you can do what you want!
Said, it's your own body, you can do what you want!

Baby, baby gotta be watching what she eats
And the ladies should work out, but not too much
She's gotta wear a summer dress in the icy wintеr streets
And smile as she freezes to thе touch

People holler from their cars and on their phones
She'd better smile more or she will die alone
But none of this is real, it's all a lie

Leva ao mar

O abraço apertado
Em quem tá do lado
O olhar de saudade
Pro céu da cidade
Três uvas na boca
Os pulos na onda
Três, dois e um

Dear diary, he's always on my mind
Every time I'm with him feels like committing a crime
I think he's the right person but this isn't the right time
And now I'm living life like I'm in 1989

Dear diary, I'm having indigestion
And yeah I know bulimia's so 1987
They say that going big will always make the best impression
But now I think I'm boarder lining unhealthy obsession

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't stop and ask me why
I'll just say why not
I've only got one life
And I'm living till my heart stops
Running out of time leave behind second thoughts
Don't care if we're caught
Our love is God

[Chorus]
Step on the gas
I already cut out the brеaks
Who cares if it lasts
Drive off a cliff and drive fast
All covеred in glass
But now we're having a blast

Kiss me one last time
We're fanning the flames
There's no turning back
We'll make them all know our names
I'll light up a match
Sit back and watch it all catch
When psycho met psychotic

[Verse 2]
Dear diary, I think I need some distance
Don't know if he's my friend, my enemy, or what's the difference
They told me growing up that I would know love in an instant
But now I think I'm questioning all fairytales existence

Dear diary, all my friends are dead
What's worse is I'm the one who cut their bodies from their heads
I forced them to drink poison and I shot them full of lead
I don't know why I did it I just did what he said

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why'd I do it?
Why not
Got one life
Pretty sure I'm gonna die soon anyway
Time is ticking
No second thoughts
So what we're caught
Our love is God

[Chorus]
Step on the gas
I already cut out the breaks
Who cares if it lasts
Drive off a cliff and drive fast
All covered in glass
But now we're having a blast

Kiss me one last time
We're fanning the flames
There's no turning back
We'll make them all know our names
I'll light up a match
Sit back and watch it all catch
When psycho met psychotic

[Bridge]
No fear
Let's go
Deep into the unknown
You're so
Pretty
Now let's kill all of society

Don't try
To undo
Or I'll just have to kill you
Lights flashing
Red and blue
Now tell me that you love me too

[Chorus]
Step on the gas
I already cut out the breaks
Who cares if it lasts
Drive off a cliff and drive fast
All covered in glass
But now we're having a blast

Kiss me one last time
We're fanning the flames
There's no turning back
We'll make them all know our names
I'll light up a match
Sit back and watch it all catch
When psycho met psychotic

Don't need an angel in the snow
Cuz you're my angel girl

Thinking 'bout the mistakes I made, I get in my mode and go harder
If I stay on my pace and stay in this lane, I'll be hotter than lava
I don't know how I did what I did, I'm just thanking the Heavenly Father
I really come from the bottom, could've got shot up, I used to ride on the MARTA
Now it's a Bentley Bentayga, Instagram models, my lil' bitch shaped like a bottle

Got a couple hearses for a couple verses
This another verse that I done caught a body
Don't do this on purpose, but you can't rehearse it

222,24319,Blow Me,P!nk,"[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 2]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Da, da da da da, da da da da
Blow me one last kiss
Da, da da da da, da da da da
Blow me one last kiss

I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the ""why's"" will all be crystal clear

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Talking 'bout it's not my style
Thought I'd see what's up, while I'm lighting up

There's a place I go to
Where no one knows me
It's not lonely
It's a necessary thing
It's a place I made up
Find out what I'm made of
The nights I've stayed up
Counting stars and fighting sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it wash over me
Ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reveals life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

[Chorus]
Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day
It gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell each other secrets
And remember how to love

(There's a place I go to)
(Find out what I'm made of)

[Verse 2]
There's a place I'm going
No one knows me
If I breathe real slowly
Let it out and let it in
It can be terrifying
To be slowly dying
Also clarifying
The end where we begin

[Pre-Chorus]
So let it wash over me
I'm ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reveals life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

[Chorus]
Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day
It gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell each other secrets
And remember how to love

While I'm wasted with someone else?""

Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down

Ooh-ooh, underneath the disco light, it's alright
Don't let this be our final song

Stand still, fallin' away from me

Fire's out, what do you want to be?

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road, I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night

But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst, down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

236,24397,Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,"[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh

And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart

Your pretty face and electric soul

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

Hustle Gang over everythin'
Yeah, uh-huh
(Driftin' away)
Ayy, hol' up

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My paranoia gettin' worse and my anxiety high
Mind got me stayin' in the eye of the fire
Sometimes, I don't know if I'ma drown or fly
Heart so big, I be down to die
For all the ones I love, too bad they don't think I really love 'em
They don't understand that there just so many of 'em
Hustle's got so many of 'em, everybody pullin' at me
Can't leave the house without everybody lookin' at me
Hm, had a dream last night
That my wife was at my wake with my son
He said, ""Look at daddy""
Somethin' got me thinkin' this might be the end
But if it is, you gon' wish for a G when I'm gone

[Chorus: Mr. Probz, Chris Brown]
Driftin' away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly driftin', driftin' away
And it feels like I'm drownin'
Pullin' against the stream, oullin' against the wave
Driftin' away
Wave after wave, wave after wave (Oh-oh)
I'm slowly driftin', driftin' away (Driftin' away)
And it feels like I'm drownin' (Driftin' away)
Pullin' against the stream, oh-oh-oh

My face above the water
And my feet can't touch the ground, touch the ground and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Every time you are not around

I'm slowly driftin' away, driftin' away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly driftin', driftin' away

Pullin' against the stream (Pullin' against the), pullin' against the

[Verse 3: Mr. Probz, Mr. Probz & Chris Brown]
I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach to find a way, I'm stuck here in between
I'm lookin' for the right words to say

I'm slowly driftin', driftin' away (Oh),

Yeah
Yawh
Clairmont The Second
Yeah, yawh, yawh, yawh

[Verse 1]

I'm an idiot for not going to sleep
Then complaining about being tired the next day
Got co-op on the regs and band and the ball team
Yo can I borrow a dollar I ain't eat all day
Sometimes my boys got me but I always pay them back
Barely roll with bills here take a quarter stack
Got some nickels and dimes too, my girl she a dime too
Well, she's not mine yet, but she will be mine soon
And yup she like all my music, to me that making no sense
I'm here thinking it wack, because my new stuff ain't drop yet
It kinda sucks I think I'm not her type man, she sleeping on me knowing I'm the right man
It may suck but it's alright man, Clairmont The Second is the best hype man
I'm my own hype man I get my own crowd amped, I go so hard on stage I give myself cramps
Styles been cramped but I take it as they can't be me but dudes try to get as close as they can
Guys ain't as fresh as me, their style so canned
How much money I will get from Socan
Forget rap tunes I bump SOS Band
You know that when I'm rapping you ll need an SOS banner
I got a couple fans, I got a couple fans
I'm in a wheelchair around tricks, them I can't stand
I don't need the groupies to tell me that I'm the man
Girls be thinking that they bad, oh my goodness don't do that
All them dudes that try to judge don't do music don't do rap
Laugh at that, counteract, put my soul on a track
Rap and track the skills I lacked, now I'm worried bout my stacks
Uh huh

[Chorus]

Looking expensive by accident
If your girl feeling me that's an accident
Pardon my steez I can't help it
With all of the groupies around, and lames all around, I'm feeling so selfish

Looking expensive by accident
If your girl feeling me that's an accident (x2)

[Verse 2]

They tryna get me to dance or rap for black history month
But they never really heard me, are they tryna make fun?
Or they got faith in me that I'm that one
Must be ill with the spit, 'cause he's ill at the drums
My girl gotta be as bad as Olivia Munn
Hungry like back to back days with no lunch
Gimme that grape soda, I don't mess with fruit punch
My wallet crunched and I'm mad 'cause I'm made to stunt
These dudes my age just put on a front
Please homie stay in the back, you don't belong in the front
I'm Mr. make your girl like me better than she like you
I don't do it purpose it happens when I walk through
Cocky much, confident, yet humble is, how I live
Ultra magnificent fly young gentleman
Everybody's who I'm better than my elegance is quite a testament on a Sunday morning tell em again

(Chorus)

[Outro]

Oh My Goodness (x3)

Uh huh

Why are you keeping me at a distance?
All that I'm asking for is forgiveness
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?
I keep on staring up at the ceiling
Waiting for you to give me some kind of reason
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?

And I know you don't owe me your love
And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
Ain't no way I'm giving up on you

Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
Show me your heart, shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
You know I can't live without you, I'm on my knees
Where are you now? Shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
So, so, so

[Verse 2: Trevor Dahl]
Why when I call, you never answer?
I'll try to talk, you keep on dancing
I can feel you on my skin, but am I only dancing with the wind?

And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all

Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you

I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus]
I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

It feels like more than distance between us?

You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better

So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Been California wishing on these stars

And I'll fall right back to you

So she ran away in her sleep

[Chorus]
And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

[Pre-Chorus]
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

[Chorus]
And dream of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la, la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She said, ""Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, I know the sun must set to rise""

[Chorus]
This could be para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
This could be para-, para-paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time in this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time

275,24362,Somebody That I Used To Know,Gotye,"[Verse 1: Gotye]
Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)
And I don't even need your love (Ooh)
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)
I guess that I don't need that, though (Ooh)
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know

E se quiser me ver, passa lá em casa

[Verso 1: MZ | Tico Santa Cruz]
Tudo que eu quero é um lugar melhor
Esquecer o mundo só pra ficar com você
Fugir da rotina, deixa ver o sol
Viver a vida como deve ser
O tempo passa, mas eu sei que a gente aprende
Depois de tantos erros, hoje eu penso diferente
Bola pra frente, amor, hoje eu me sinto tão bem
Hoje eu me sinto tão bem
Então abre um sorriso, é o que eu preciso, vai, vai
Nós dois num paraíso e deixa tudo pra trás
O mundo é da gente amor
Eu tô contigo, então vem

[Pré-Refrão 1: MZ]
Pode pagar pra ver que eu vou
Pode falar pra ser que eu sou
O que você precisa e o resto tanto faz
Pode parar que eu sei que eu sou
Quem vai colar contigo, amor
Se tamo junto, eu tô na paz

Sabe da vibe que essa gata emana
Num corpo perfeito de Copacabana
Cabelo no vento, teu cheiro me chama
Vivendo dez anos num fim de semana
Me encontra mais tarde que a gente combina
Vambora, menina, segura minha mão
Adoro teu jeito, só você me ensina
Que não tem rotina essa relação
Que nossa casinha é nossa mansão
E nosso futuro já tá planejado
O maior presente é bola pra frente
Esquece do mundo e dos erros passados
Já tava escrito que nós dava um livro
Contigo eu sigo assim lado a lado
E o que tiver de ser vai ser
O amor é claro

[Pré-Refrão 2: Tico Santa Cruz]
O que tiver de ser, será
E o amor que prevalecerá por nós
Vamos juntos celebrar a força
Quero ouvir a sua voz
Sua presença me faz bem
Me sinto forte pra lutar
Contigo eu vou de olho fechado, mulher
E o que tiver de ser será

Será o que tiver de ser, nada vai mudar
Sei lá, mas se quiser me ver

Tô achando que eu já esqueci coração vai e vem e nem vai sentir saudade
Tô cavando um buraco sem fundo, mais uma noite sem ver ela
Coração apanha que nem vagabundo

Pior que a sua turma é a mesma que eu ando
Cê sabe com é tem sempre um amigo em comum comentando
Já percebi que ela ta diferente falou que a te rola de novo
Mas só se for amizade entre a gente, coração não entende

Só nossa amizade não vai compensar pra mim
Ser só seu amigo forçado vai ser muito ruim
Só nossa amizade não vai compensar pra mim
Sonhar com alguém sem ser sonhado é tiro de festim

Vou te ensinar como se bota pra fuder

Tinha naipe de estilista meio Janelle Monae
Dispensou quatro na pista em dez minuto de rolê
Vem com o bonde das amigas que te bota pra correr
Curte funk das antigas, uh uh tererê
Me deixou apaixonado, coisa que era impossível
Passos de Aline Riscado, quando dança indiscutível
Lábio grande, adocicado, swingado indescritível
Já pulo ser namorado e já posso ir pro outro nível

[Pré-Refrão]
Veio em mim, chamou de meu rei
O que você pedir é lei
Também disse assim
Aproveita, docinho
Que amanhã eu não sei
Logo eu, durão convencido
Coração meio endurecido
Ficou mole, esmorecido
E a partir de agora não sou eu mais quem decido

[Refrão]
Eu não sei dizer ""bye, bye""
Do meu coração não sai
Penso o tempo inteiro
Olha que eu não era assim
Eu vivo correndo atrás
Só que não tem nós dois mais
Só ficou o cheiro
Mó pedaço de mau caminho

[Verso 2]
O cheiro dela ficou na casa inteira
Era suave, leve, capim-cidreira
Eu vacilão, me entreguei de primeira
'Cê destroçou meu coração, traiçoeira
Firmão, 'cê pega o beco, segue o baile, eu tô seguindo
Vou te pôr no meu passado, não é pra lá que eu tô indo
De amor já tô curado, deu errado, eu tô sentindo
Finjo que não tô lembrado que a gente tava saindo

Neto de pescador desbravando os mares
Nunca fui exemplo para o filho da vizinha
Exemplo foi minha mãe, criou minhas irmãs sozinha
Trate bem todas mulheres, respeite sua rainha
Não aprenda só na perda a valorizar o que tinha
Minha vó, velha guerreira, um coração gigante
Tive o amor pra vida inteira, digo que foi o bastante
Pra formar, me informar pra vida
Quantos que perdi nessa rotina bandida

[Refrão]
Ôh mãe, ôh mãe!
Me espere em casa que o seu filho tá de volta
Ôh mãe, ôh mãe!
Perdoe meus pecados nos momentos de revolta
Odeio o dinheiro mas, odeio mais ainda a falta que ele nos faz
Trabalhando em dobro pra te dar uma vida em paz

[Verso 2]
Minha mãe tá na barraca
Meu pai tá no volante
Enquanto a minha irmã buscando a bolsa de estudante
Minha família, meu maior exemplo
Que o senhor nos dê saúde para aproveitar o tempo
A rua foi minha escola, o rap meu ensinamento
O suor do meu trabalho hoje trouxe alimento
Minha irmã pequena se dedica no esporte
Aprendeu comigo que só sobrevive os fortes
Carrego um fardo de milhões
Corro atrás do atraso conforme as estações
Nessa selva de pedra vou matando leões
E a Babilônia segue fabricando suas ilusões
Me envolvi em fita errada mas hoje sou livramento
Pros irmão da rua em meio do sofrimento
2 de Julho 92, regional São José, nascia um guerreiro no ventre de uma mulher

[Refrão]
Ôh mãe, ôh mãe!
Me espere em casa que o seu filho tá de volta
Ôh mãe, ôh mãe!
Perdoe meus pecados nos momentos de revolta
Odeio o dinheiro mas, odeio mais ainda a falta que ele nos faz
Trabalhando em dobro pra te dar uma vida em paz
Ôh mãe, ôh mãe!
Me espere em casa que o seu filho tá de volta
Ôh mãe, ôh mãe!
Perdoe meus pecados nos momentos de revolta
Odeio o dinheiro mas, odeio mais ainda a falta que ele nos faz
Trabalhando em dobro pra te dar uma vida em paz

Comenta sempre
Que eu presto pouco
E você já enrolou muita gente

Não tenta de novo

Vai ser perigoso eu e você
Se o beijo der certo

Mas você chegou
O beijo rolou
A noite passou
E a gente acordou

Olhando pro teto
O nosso reflexo
Sem roupa
O peixe morre pela própria boca!

Como é que faz
Quando nenhum dos dois
É flor que se cheira
Quando a malandra
Se apaixona no tranqueira
Quando foi sério
O que era pra ser brincadeira

Yeah, yeah
Nosso lance tem um quê de novela
História bela que não teria graça sem batalha
A gente é o casal principal que tem que ficar junto
O problema é que todo o resto da trama atrapalha
Na minha mente sua imagem
Nem vem com tecnologia (Não), não se mata saudade por mensagem
E a falta um do outro causa estrago
Difícil se encontrar, parece aquele filme A Casa do Lago
Hey! Me diz onde 'cê tá que eu vou até aí (Eu vou)
De carro, de metrô, até a pé, aí (Pode crê)
Fugir dessa neblina, ver o sol sair
Só sei que na rotina não pode cair (Não)
Um espaço na agenda eu consigo e você?
O meu compromisso mesmo é contigo
Visualizo, você fica bem de qualquer jeito
Mas fica ainda melhor é comigo (Digo)

Ainda tô na rua porque tenho uma missão (Aham)
Cansei de ouvir sua voz por Android ou iPhone
Nossa ligação sempre foi além do telefone (Ahn)
Te ouvir chamando baixinho o meu nome
Enquanto meu olhar flutua em seu corpo igual drone
Teu mistério às vezes me consome
Chega forte como chuva de verão depois some
Clássica menina veneno
Te procuro à noite já que dizem que o mundo é pequeno (Né não?)
E posso te sentir pensando em mim também
Isso é química rara, pouca gente tem (Hey!)
Desculpa pelo sumiço
Só não me deixa sem sinal igual celular sem serviço

And the sirens ring in the distance
Like a lullaby song singing us to sleep
For us to keep

[Chorus (Extended): Elliphant]
Oh, when will I see you now?
Stranger, could you walk me home?
Even if I drift somehow
No cry, I'm never gonna sleep alone
Never gonna sleep alone now, I don’t sleep alone, no
Never gonna sleep alone, I don’t sleep alone, no
Never gonna sleep alone, I don't sleep alone, no, no
I'm never gonna sleep alone

[Breakdown 2: Elliphant]
I'm never gonna sleep alone
Never gonna sleep alone, I don’t sleep alone, no
Never gonna sleep alone, I don’t sleep alone, no
Never gonna sleep alone, I don't sleep alone, no
Never gonna sleep alone, never gonna sleep alone

[Outro: Elliphant]
Oh, when will I see you now?
Stranger, could you walk me home?

Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

Some superhero, some fairytale bliss

Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

Pra não te ver mais, pra não sofrer mais

E do seu beijo quero ter desgosto
Vou me desfazendo de você pouco a pouco

324,24454,Muito Cedo,Turma do Pagode,"Cê gosta de praia muleca tua onda
É de mini-saia na pista de dança
Mas na areia vira sereia de canga
Enquanto o mar canta

Cê gosta de praia e do cheiro das ondas
Pois só elas trazem de volta a lembrança
Que já é por fora uma moça que encanta
Por dentro criança

Eu quero praia e sol, um lugar pra namorar
Até com chuva é bom, a gente pode conversar
Eu quero praia e só, uma rede pra deitar
Tocar meu violão, juro que cê vai ficar

Quero mais, muito mais, bem mais
Make me feel good, you make me feel right
Quero mais, muito mais, bem mais
Make me feel good, you make me feel right

Corre descalça pro mar feito menina
Teu beijo pode dopar, então me alucina
Logo eu me perco
Dentro do teu olhar
Não tem mais jeito
Só penso nela
Queria poder te mostrar
Já tá nos planos ter nosso lugar
Uma casinha modesta à beira mar
E a beira mar, poder te amar

Eu quero praia e sol, um lugar pra namorar
Até com chuva é bom, a gente pode conversar
Eu quero praia e só, uma rede pra deitar
Tocar meu violão, juro que cê vai ficar

Quero mais, muito mais, bem mais

Underundê, undê, undêrere
Underundê, undê, undêrere
Underundê, undê, undêrere

Quero uma vida só eu e você
Sem mistério não quero mais ninguém
Me liga e conta o que quer fazer
Acordo cedo, posso ir pra aí te ver

Eu quero praia e sol, um lugar pra namorar
Até com chuva é bom, a gente pode conversar
Eu quero praia e só, uma rede pra deitar
Tocar meu violão, juro que cê vai ficar

Quero mais, muito mais, bem mais
Make me feel good, you make me feel right
Quero mais, muito mais, bem mais
Make me feel good, you make me feel right

Pra meus sentimentos
São recaídas, sei que vai passar
É só questão de tempo

São 5 horas da manhã e eu perturbando o dono do bar
Pedindo uma cerveja e cigarros pra me acalmar

Não é assim tão fácil
Esquecer alguém que você tanto amou
Dá pra ver no meu rosto o meu sofrimento
Meu semblante mudou

E no sinal parado, a cabeça voando
No som do meu carro, a música tocando
Eu vou pensando nela, eu vou pensando nela

E no sinal parado, a cabeça voando
Atrás do meu carro, os outros buzinando
Eu vou pensando nela, eu vou pensando nela

Com medo de voltar pra casa

No passageiro umas garrafas
E a saudade
Tô enrolando na rua
Bebendo uma por uma
Madrugada com o vidro fechado
Chorando com tudo que toca no rádio
Parei no sinaleiro
Pra esperar o sinal vermelho

Três batidas no meu vidro
Quando vi era um bandido
Falou perdeu
Eu disse
Eu perdi mesmo
Mas foi o grande amor da minha vida

Deve-se ter cuidado ao passar no trapézio
Memo que pese o desespero dos novos tempos
Se um like serve ao ódio, bro, nesse episódio
Breve o bom senso diz, ""Respire um momento""
É sobre aprender, tipo giz e lousa
O espírito repousa, reza e volta cem por cento
Cale tudo que o mundo fale e pense
Enquanto vida vale, seja luz desse dia cinzento
E ela disse, ""Deus te acompanhe, pretin', bom dia""
Me deu um beijo e virou poesia
""Deus te acompanhe, pretin'""
E um lampejo de amor explodiu em alegria
""Deus te acompanhe, pretin'
Volta pra nós como um camisa 10 após o gol""
Meu peito rufla, o olho brilha, isso é ter uma família
Minha alma disse, ""Demorou""

Topar qualquer luta
Pelas pequenas alegrias da vida adulta

Correr a maratona, chegar primeiro
E gritar, ""É por você, amor""

O gol da virada quase que nós rebaixa
Emendar um feriado nesses litorais
Encontrar uma Tupperware que a tampa ainda encaixa (Ô, glória!)
Mais cedo brotou alecrim em segredo
Tava com jeito que ia dar capim
Ela reclama do azedo, recolhe os brinquedo
Triunfo hoje pra mim é o azul no boletim
Uma boa promoção de fraldas nessas drogaria
O faz me rir na hora extra vinda do serviço
Presentes feitos com guache e crepom lembra meu dia
Penso que os sonhos de Deus devem ser tipo isso

Aí encontrei com os moleque. Aí o Jhow me contou essa história: ele falou que tava na laje da casa dele fumando um cigarro. É um sobradão que tem quatro andar, tá ligado? Aí, quando ele olha lá embaixo na rua, tem um maluco tentando forçar a porta do carro dele. Forçando assim pra tentar abrir pra roubar o rádio. Sabe quando o maluco tá tentando pra roubar? Pois é! Aí o Jhow lá de cima olhou: ""Mano, e agora?"" Olhou pro lado e tinha um pedra gigante, um pedregulho assim, tá ligado? Ele falou assim: ""Mano, é isso memo! Vou mirar e acertar logo no pote!"" Moleque, ó o que aconteceu: o Jhow mirou no cara, acertou no teto do carro, Leandro. Ele quebrou o carro todo, viado. O maluco foi tentar salvar o carro e quebrou a porra toda. E não contente, a força do impacto abriu a porta que o cara não tava conseguindo abrir e o maluco não me levou o rádio do cara embora?! Ah, cê é louco, eu vou contar essa fita no stand up, tá brincando?!

Meu palpite é que tá livre
Bateu saudade ou tá quebrando as regras
Faz tempo que não puxava conversa
Ainda mais numa hora dessas
Pra mim, só o que interessa

[Refrão]
Se eu fui o primeiro que você lembrou
Sinal que ainda é fã do jeito que eu faço amor
Ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô
Se chamar de novo, eu vou
Se quiser reprise, eu dou
Se eu fui o primeiro que você lembrou
Sinal que ainda é fã do jeito que eu faço amor
Ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô
Se chamar de novo, eu vou
Se quiser reprise, eu dou
Ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô
Ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô

[Saída]
Se chamar de novo, eu vou
(Ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô, ô)
Se quiser reprise, eu dou

342,24473,Mandona,Oriente,"[Verso 1: Chino]
E era tarde, ela na rua sozinha
Se perguntando por que ainda não era só minha
E o seu sorriso tinha uma covinha
Que aparece quando ela ri bem aqui
Ela chegou, tava jogado no sofá
Reclamando que eu não atendo o celular
Mulher é foda, adora mandar
E ela achando que é minha dona, assim não dá
Mas quando ela tira a roupa, esnobe rebola no colo do pai
A cabeça não pensa direito e a gente não sabe o que faz
A gente na cama se entende, sei muito bem que tu gosta
Ela é esnobe, mas corre atrás, faz cara feia, me doma, mandona
Faz cara feia, me doma, menina mandona
Menina

[Refrão: Hariel]
Quando ela me chama
Com a vozinha rouca de uma noite mal dormida
Nessa hora ela me ganha
Hipnotizada, ela veio só de calcinha trazer meu café na cama
O mundo todo lá fora, nós numa prosa gostosa, a gente ri e dança
O mundo todo lá fora, toca o som que ela mais gosta, a gente goza e transa, samba
Toda envergonhada, pique criança levada querendo atenção
Eu mato no peito e te dou condição
Eu sei que vale a pena e vai
Quando ela me chama
Com a vozinha rouca de uma noite mal dormida
Nessa hora ela me ganha
Hipnotizada, ela veio só de calcinha trazer meu café na cama
O mundo todo lá fora, nós numa prosa gostosa, a gente ri e dança
O mundo todo lá fora, toca o som que ela mais gosta, a gente goza e transa, samba
Transa, samba, transa, samba
Uma mistura louca

[Verso 2: Hariel]
Uma mistura louca que eu provei e gostei
Difícil conversar, que até me acostumei
Com você do meu lado me ensinando o que eu já sei
Ou eu te contando histórias da constituição sem lei
Fica mais um pouco até o sol sair
E só vai embora quando ele voltar
Quando a lua vir, nós tenta insistir
Quando o sol chegar, tentamo enganar
Então fecha a cortina e vem cá
Faço tu acreditar que realmente manda
Desliga esse celular e para de enrolar
Vem aqui pra cama

[Verso 3: Chino]
Ela vem só de calcinha tipo uma visão de filme
Parecia que eu era o Drake e ela a mina do meu clipe
Jogando a bunda pra cima, menina mandona
Uma princesa na pista e uma **** na cama
Passamo a tarde toda aqui no quarto
Já é de madrugada, mas pra nós ainda é cedo
Deixa ela mandar ou pedir que eu faço, porque ela sempre manda
E às vezes eu obedeço

[Refrão: Hariel]

348,24474,Praia do Rosa,Oriente,"[Letra de “Praia do Rosa (Acústico)”]

[Verso 1: Nissin]
Na Praia do Rosa
Jogada na canga, ela é maravilhosa
E sabe que é gostosa
Ha, esquece o mundo lá fora
E o som do mar vira trilha sonora
Ganhamos momentos e perdemos a hora
Ahn, é o poder do agora
É, ela vem toda cheirosa
E o som do mar vira trilha sonora
De tanto que perdi o chão, eu aprendi a voar
Mesmo sem saber ao certo onde ia chegar
A luz me guia e ilumina mais um dia
Ela me faz tão bem, ela me faz tão bem
Um pouco de calmaria pro meu corre
Na cidade grande, onde mata ou morre
Esses olho gordo querem tudo que eu tenho
Nunca me adiantaram, então não atrasa, não fode

[Refrão: Cynthia Luz]
Eu vi o caminho do sol
Eu sigo o caminho da luz
Eu sei que a gente tentou
Esse mar que me aproximou
De vez, de lei, você e eu, e eu

[Verso 2: Cynthia Luz]
Entrega de alma
Se chega pedindo perdão, perdoa antes que o dia acaba
Pôr do sol é seu olhar, encanta o mar
E me aquece e a lua só cresce
É questão de decidir e persistir
Que a prece foi ouvida e tem a quem desacredita
Aqui a passagem de ida e vinda
Ilumina e faz amor sorrindo
Esconde esse segredo tão lindo
Eu já ia partir, tava escrito
Eu estive presente de longe
Não há nada nesse mundo que me encante mais
Não há, êiê

[Verso 3: Delacruz]
Me beijou e me chamou de super-herói
Então, ela me levou na Ponte Rio-Niterói
Só pra confirmar, me perguntou, ""Você não disse que voava?""
Só pra me testar, ela me abraçou e pulou na água
Ela não viu que era metáfora
Assim como essa, eu sei o que eu vi
No fim dessa história, que é muito boa
Eu salvei você, fiquei com um finin'
Você não perde o seu tempo à toa
Já me mostrou, eu já entendi
Oriente, se você é a luz
Que o Delacruz roubou de mim

[Refrão: Cynthia Luz]
Eu vi o caminho do sol
Eu sigo o caminho da luz
Eu sei que a gente tentou
Esse mar que me aproximou
De vez, de lei, você e eu, e eu

[Verso 4: Chino]
Nem a chuva relaxa, o mundo agora chora
Vamo pro lado de fora, vem, se molha
Ela me olha e parece que tenho alguma resposta
Mas não tem nem pergunta, a gente meio que se gosta
Ontem queria que ela ficasse, mas foi embora
Ela sabe o quanto vale, por isso que ela joga
Eu tô aqui esperando, na esperança que ela volta
Três dias de amor na Praia do Rosa
Estrela do Oriente aqui nos mares do Sul
Só eu e você e a imensidão azul
Eu sei que ela acha que me deixa bobo
Eu finjo que tô bobo só pra te agradar
Mas o jogador não te ama, ele ama o jogo
Meu trem tá partindo, eu nasci pra cantar
Sexo de despedida, ela fica emotiva
Na briga, me esquenta, tão linda, tão braba
A vida não para pra gente se amar
Lança desculpa na cama
Não somos casal, mas a gente se ama
Vamos viver nossos sonhos, a gente ainda vai se encontrar

[Refrão: Cynthia Luz]
Eu vi o caminho do sol
Eu sigo o caminho da luz
Eu sei que a gente tentou
Esse mar que me aproximou
De vez, de lei, você e eu, e eu

Ladies and Gentlemen
This show comes with a health warning
It may blow your mind

[Verse 1]
So many questions in my head, sometimes I think that music is dead
Just too commercial for this industry? Or are You people just too easy to please?
I don’t give a shit ‘cos it’s a waste of time!
Honestly, I don't know where to find
A place where they’re not trying to control my mind!

[Chorus]
It's made to sell
Doesn't matter if sounds like hell!
As long as money goes in their pockets
Everybody’s happy with the profits

[Verse 2]
Wait a moment, what am I saying?
I’m tryin’ to make money, but I never get paid
So - they come with bullshit that I need to take
They come with bullshit that I have to play
But - they only care if you are pretty enough to;
Raise your game, change your name, the aim is fame
All the same, it’s a shame, go down in flames
Make money for them, then they’ll kick you out!
Trust me

[Chorus]
It's made to sell
Doesn't matter if sounds like hell!
As long as money goes in their pockets
Everybody’s happy with the profits

[Outro]
I don’t know why we have to listen
Artists are just puppets on a string
Controlled what to do, what to sing
How can this rebel be king?

[Chorus]
It's made to sell
Doesn't matter if sounds like hell!
As long as money goes in their pockets
Everybody’s happy with the profits

너 보단 내가 더 커
넌 160 난 1
마마무 마마무 마마무
우리 끼리끼리끼리
딱 1cm 차이

[Verse 1: Hwasa]
뭔 헛소리 일단 휘인인 먼 나라 얘기
Ok? 베프지만 키 앞에선
장사 없지 small 휘인 어줍자니 일센치
가지고 언니들 이러기?
우리 쿨하게 좀 가자 나만 힐 신기

[Refrain: Moonbyul & Hwasa]
너와 나의 차이 1cm (언닌 두상이 좀 커)
그냥 받아들여 난쟁이 (그냥 받아들여)
달라질 건 없어 인생 (뭐라카노)
Do you know what I'm saying?

[Verse 2: Moonbyul]
아이고 우리 언니가
어디 번데기 앞에서
주름을 잡을까요?
이봐요 올라오려면 멀었네
여기 높은 곳까지
거기 아랫 공기는 어때?
많이 탁하지?
난 거기 못 가 입장불가
고만고만해 그만그만해
이럴 시간 있음
다른 거나 고민해

A-Yo 반올림해도
작아요 나보다 더
깔창을 깔아봐요 소용없나요
힐을 신어도 티가 나고
운동화를 신어도 티가 나
키 순서가 도레미파

[Refrain: Moonbyul & Solar]
너와 나의 차이 1cm (1.8)
누가 봐도 이건 same same (둘 다 두상이 좀 커)
여긴 우물 안의 전쟁
You know what I'm talking about?

[Verse 4: Hwasa, Moonbyul & Hwasa]
거기 문스타 아주 그냥 물 만나셨어
어허 인정해 여유 넘치는 게
장신인척 난리 우월한 척 난리
최홍만 인 척 난리 그래 봤자 도토리
맷돌손잡이가 빠졌어 맷돌손잡이가 빠졌어
지나가는 조태오가 웃어
(지금 내 기분이 그래 어이가 없네)

언제든 지칠 때 기대 언제든지
이렇게 널 안을 때 아픔은 의미를 잃어가
모두 다 사라져 that's right
Baby you so cool 몰라도 너무 모르고
거울 속에 비친 너 하나로
이 세상 모든 어둠 걷어줘

가득 차 있네 it's full of you

400,24559,GLOW,CORSAK,"[Verse 1: Robinson]
Prisoners of war
Me and you
And our baggage
Pieces that we lost
Like a cross
That we carry

[Pre-Chorus: Robinson]
But even though it's years ago, you’re still inside my mind
You should know that
Like a glow so beautiful, it takes me back in time
To what we had

[Chorus: Robinson]
So when I close my eyes
It's just like you're by my side
And I can hold you like
Like it was the first time
Even if I only get to see you in my mind
It’s not over
This is not a last goodbye
Because I love you like the first time
Even if I only get to see you in my mind
It's not over
This is not a last goodbye
Because I love you like the first time

[Verse 2: Robinson]
These revolving doors
We go through
Leave us damaged
We were so in love
Me and you
But we panicked

[Pre-Chorus: Robinson]
We talk on the telephone and you act like you're fine
It's just a mask
'Cause I can hear it in your voice, a part of you is still mine
So let's go back

[Chorus: Robinson]
So when you close your eyes
Pretend that I'm by your side
And I will hold you like
Like it was the first time
Even if you only get to see me in your mind
You should know that
This is not a last goodbye
Because I love you like the first time
Even if you only get to see me in your mind
You should know that
This is not a last goodbye
Because I love you like the first time

Jak brałem pierwsze baggi, szkity grały mi marsza
I jak brałeś też wtedy, to na bank w militariach
Typ za ladą bez jedynek dywagował o Panterze
Z damą w t-sie z napisem ""komercja zjada scenę""
Pierdoliłem metal, zawsze wolałem punk-rock
I polski rap - to był wtedy ten sam hardcore
Miałem Pasażera skandal, glany, gieta
I każdą z tych rzeczy zawsze chcieli mi zajebać
Mogli wąchać mi pałę jak klej w białych zrywkach
Jedyne co im dałem, to bless przy ich klepsydrach
Dekada z okładem mija mnie dziś luźno, ziomciu
I to życie zamiast biec, ciągnie się jak turbo w słońcu
Nie wierz w plotki, życie jest długie w chuj
Dlatego zamiast fondue, stawiasz wódę na stół
Bierzesz lufę do ust, czas się przystosować
I albo wygra Charles w tobie albo Kurt Cobain

[Zwrotka 2]
A propos Bukowski bardzo poczytny w liceum
Co jest kurwa żałosne jak potyczki pionierów
Po piętnastu latach dają zwrotki, że idź w pizdu
Na szesnastu lata lepiej użytkownik ślizgu
Po dekadzie ponad czuję się jak tetryk z majkiem
Nie czuję syntezatora, czuję kurwa cięty sampel
Nie zrozum mnie źle, lubię brzmienia maszyn
Ale łatwo tu o wieś - weź przekaż naszym
Czas zapierdala? Może ziomie po koksie
Zapierdalala w Las Palmas, nie Europie Wschodniej
Życie jest długie, piętnasty rok w knajpach
Każe ubiegać w ZUS-ie się o status kombatanta
Życie jak ludzie, jest w większości na odstrzał
Zbiór pustych kukieł żebrzących o poklask
I jedyny kurwa patent na to życie, prócz bomby
To znaleźć swoją pasję i być w tym dobrym

[Zwrotka 3]
Skill po pierwsze, gdzie mój klin, ej, co nie chce
Wycieram wity w jeans, daj mi bit na wejście
(Laik, kill'em) No idę jak Hannibal Le-le-lecter
Bydło w tisach Magika dzwonić po animal savers
Tępa kurwoo, ja to nowa era jak caps
Te to bez kitu (La-Laik Busta Rhymes)
Te to treści w chuj, jak rześki giet to gram
Dla miejskich crew zniosę getto glam
Nie dla 95 crews mam do młodych ludzi uraz, nara
W tej bluzie wyglądasz jakbyś miał się zgubić w górach zara
Wini wie jak ruszyć, żeby Sob mógł niszczyć
W ogóle VVN stopro props za instynkt
Mam taką twarz, że kiepski ze mnie ziom do fot na najbie
Nawet, gdy patrzę w obiektyw, boisz się o lustrzankę
Taki ze mnie złodziej jak z Eldo agresor
Nawet jeśli to zrobię, to na pewno kalecząc

Także taksuj do woli, ale zwacha na wnioski
Czasem IQ zawodzi, jak się starasz nas rozgryźć
Daję tajfun na strony, zapierdalaj na orczyk

L.o.l. jak rap gra, że net przerżnął biz
R.a.p. na kompaktach jest dziś retro jak Fisz
PKU na klatkach jest już past jak simple
Mamy n2 w dunkach kontra hajp na Firmę
Dolny Śląsk, czytaj dobry joint
Jak masz lolki, nie pytam: ej a torby skąd?
I jak pytasz ej Laik, jak Glidera rozkminiać
To jak chciałbym, żebyś dał mi cella do tego dilla
I jak nie wiesz o co chodzi, to weź się kurwa dowiedz
Jak nie, milcz jak na Milczeniu Owiec
Ta dekadę ponad napierdala u mnie Skandal
To jedyny Polak, który zdołał wejść w papilaria mi

Byłem tu jak pierwszy Haem robił Ein Killa Hertz
I pierwszy raz widziałem ile to kilo eee?
Nasz kraj, masz ciśnienie na progres

Wlewam olej w półkule i je stawiam nad ogniem

Bardziej jaram się supportem - jaka pierwsza liga?

Never know I was crossing those lines
You said it was fine, but I say it way too much
Never know what you got 'til it's gone

Hanging in the dorm room, no class

Why does it always end like that?

When it's all too much, then you take me home
Wearing no make-up, think I'm beautiful
And when I'm all messed up, you let me be me

There's always gonna be somebody smarter
Someone prettier who works a little harder
Someone that who ain't afraid to take it farther
And every time I feel like I ain't really worth it
Then you say I'm perfect
I know there's always gonna be somebody better
Someone easier who's got it all together
And every time I feel like I ain't really worth it
Then you say I'm perfect

I know there's always gonna be somebody better
Someone easier who's got it all together
And every time I feel like I ain't really worth it
Then you say I'm perfect

428,24587,The One That Got Away,Whistle Back,"[Intro]
One, two, buckle my show
Mmm, yeah
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I stood by the exit door of the hotel café
He was playin' with his band
I've always been a sucker
Had a weakness for a boy with a guitar and a drink in his hand
His words were like heaven in my hurricane
My knees buckled under
I thought everyone was watching me
Watching you save my life with the song

[Pre-Chorus]
You were mine
In the back of my mind
Oh, just for one night
Just for a while

[Chorus]
There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you then slips away

[Verse 2]
Said two weeks later I was sitting in his apartment
He was making cappuccino
I said, ""What kind of man makes cappuccino?""
We laughed, we laughed, we laughed
We laughed 'til tears ran down my face
Oh, but my man, you're someone else's man
And that ain't the man that I wanna want
But you keep drawin' me in with those big brown lyin' eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
But you'll always be mine
In the back of my mind
Oh, we had a night
Just a little while

[Chorus]
There's always one that gets away, mm
The one that sneaks up on you then slips away

[Bridge]
In a closed off corner of my heart, yeah, yes
I'll always see your face
The one that got away (The one that got away)
The one that got away (The one that got away)
Oh, the one that got away (The one that got away)
Oh, the one that got away (The one that got away)
Oh, the one that got away
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 3]
I'm not a victim of clichés
I don't believe in soul mates
Happy endings, only one
Oh, and I met you and all that changed
I had a taste and you're still sitting on the tip of my tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
But you were mine
Somewhere in time
I'll look for you first
In my next life

[Chorus]
There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you then slips away (Slips away)

In a closed off corner of my heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

[Verse 1]
Cold hands, red eyes
Packed two bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

[Chorus]
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you when your heart is tired

[Verse 2]
When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don’t talk
And if they could, they’d say
Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

[Chorus]
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you when your heart is tired

I know those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Try so hard to get away
Think about you every day
Try so hard to live without
But no, no más
Sun shine is shining far away
Birds eyes just looking out
And they can see that you’re, you’re mine

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause when we’re together, your love is controlling my brain
Like plunging inside of that fire I cannot contain

[Chorus]
Our love is like a heatwave
It’s burning through the evening rain
Sets sail out on an ocean wave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave

[Verse 2]
I never will walk away
Unless you’re right by my side
Burn gas in the Chevrolet
She’s so hot
And our connection’s like Wi-Fi
Just love how you ricochet
Won’t stop ’til you’re satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause when we’re together, your love is controlling my brain
Like plunging inside of that fire I cannot contain

Strong current won’t stop you
Just makes me want you more
Couldn’t leave if I want to
I wash up at your door
I know at times, we break the rules
Temperatures rise when I’m with you

It’s burning through the evening rain
Sets sail out on an ocean wave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
Heatwave heatwave heatwave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave

431,24606,Malibu,Miley Cyrus,"[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

[Bridge]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu (Baby)
Next to you (Oh, oh)

Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start, a dream come true in Malibu

I'm supposed to call you
But I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though
I'm just on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

[Chorus]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

[Verse 2]
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

[Pre-Chorus]
All the fucked up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely

Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how do we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how do we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it ""Love""
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong

I would still be holdin' you like this

'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spendin' all this money while you're sittin' 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you (Yeah)

I've been so alone, I've been going home
Hey, is it any colder? Does he keep you warm like i did?

You found someone, born and raised in London
Was the cars not big enough for you?

Two room apartment, I'm stuck here where you left me
I just can't start on something new

The fire's reaching internal inferno
This is not a drill, no we are standing still
We're so close at breaking, we're shaking
The flames are closing in, they're burning everything

It feels like inferno x5

Hey, it's freezing here in Stockholm, I've been so alone
Someone bring me home.
It's almost like a movie, the fall is in the stars
You can see them from afar

I found someone, thought he was my lovesong
But the words got twisted in my head
Two room apartment, was all i ever wanted
Just wanna start with you again

The fire's reaching internal inferno
This is not a drill, no we are standing still
We're so close at breaking, we're shaking
The flames are closing in, they're burning everything

It feels like inferno x5

Hey, how is life in Stockholm, I've been so alone

Hey, it's freezing here in Stockholm, I've been so alone
I'm lost without you

This is not a drill, no we are standing still
We're so close at breaking, we're shaking
The flames are closing in, they're burning everything

It feels like inferno x5

But now you're in the bed with someone else
You needed change, you needed space
But now you're texting me without regrets
And do you think that I'm insane?
Now you're in my room and all undressed
You're holding onto me like you're so obsessed
I could never love you like that, love you like that

You think of me when kissing him
And now you're drunk as hell to ease the pain
Still wear my clothes, still calling me
But I will never talk to you again
And do you think that I'm insane?
How many times do I have to explain
You're holding onto me like you're so obsessed
I could never love you like that
Yeah-h-h, you're holding onto me like you're so obsessed
I could never love you like that, love you like that

From now on we'd never be the same. yeaah

Hundred miles and I know you can't slow us slow us down

Baby I can see thе blue skies in your eyes
Add a couple of drinks now you moving in the skies
Working all day playing all night
Fucking we ain't living just to living just to die
One word hello turns to three words I love you
I take whatever you give me I trust you
Even if the sunlight fades n the whole world shakes
I'll be there, I'll be there

When you wake up wake up
I can see it in your eyes ohhh

You are the one thing that I’m afraid I can’t keep

I think that I’m crashing down…

I feel like we’re crashing down…


You’re way too tired to stay awake with me
You are the one thing that I’m afraid I can’t keep
And I remember how it used to be… When I would still appear in your dreams… Now you’re not even holding me… I guess this darkness is all you see

And I’ve been counting stars on the ceiling of my bedroom signaling for help from jupiter to saturn
Loosing sleep but it doesn’t really matter now… Im already crashing down…

She could be the one that kills you

We fight and we collide, crashing everyday
And if you feel afraid
We won't leave you

'Till now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

[Verse 1: P. Reign]
I sit back and reminisce, it hurts to think about it all
We was on top of the world, whoever though that we would fall?
Standing by the phone, alone, ignoring your call
I feel like Spider-Man, you got me flying off of the wall
I ain't wanna leave, but still I had to go
'Cause what good's a rainbow with out my pot of gold?
And now your bed's empty and your pillow's cold
You never realised the love until my love was gone

[Pre-Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you
Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

[Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
'Till now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you ('Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

The phone call
Can you stop the free fall?
Can you be the reason I can see beyond the lies
If I keep holding on?
I hear you (Hear you)
Can you stop the screaming? (Screaming)
Did you stop believing?
I could feel you letting go, I can't be alone tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you
Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

'Till now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you ('Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Woah, I hope that it won't end though
Alone...
And I'm hoping that you know that

'Till now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you ('Til I met you)

How do I get you alone?

When you gonna let me know
If you give a damn about me?
'Cause you got my hands tied
In my defense, I always fall for confidence
And your compliments look good on me

'Cause nobody knows it better
Than the girl in the corner
With the Scarlet Letter
And while you're watching
You may think that she doesn't matter
But no one knows you better

Taking me to years yet to come
You said that you just wanted some fun
But then my eyes got blurry so blurry

Take me home fulfil all my fantasies
You and me, can break out of reality
Feel that we, we can't fight where we belong

We know we can burn it down
Our memories are fading out
So say you'll never lose it now
You're the best that I ever found

We know we can burn it down

We're not left behind
Cause we chose to love all the time
Along the way we learned how to fight
We got this no worries, no worries

Take me home fulfil all my fantasies
You and me, can break out of reality
Feel that we, we can't fight where we belong
We know we can burn it down
Our memories are fading out
So say you'll never lose it now

And my heart is feeling vacant

As I know, I should let it go

"
505,24674,Matches,Cash Cash,"[Verse 1]
I remember how we used to be so beautiful
You broke my heart at 16
The first time I felt my world come crashing
Black magic, like your heart was made of matches
And I never got over it

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear your friends know when to post your photograph
It doesn’t really hurt, but it always takes me back to 16
In your basement and your parents, my feelings
And I never got over it

[Chorus]
How did you break my heart without even trying?
How are you on my mind? You're not even talking to me
You were made of matches, and you burned me to the ground
You were made of matches, and you burned me down

[Verse 2]
Everybody says that you're still living your life
One weekend to the next still tryna' get it right
The truth is I worry you never found something to escape who you used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my own way of coping with your mess
And I found my own reasons why you weren't the best for me
Why couldn't you be the best for me?

[Chorus]
How did you break my heart without even trying?
How are you on my mind? You're not even talking to me
You were made of matches, and you burned me to the ground
You were made of matches, and you burned me down

[Outro]
You were made of matches and you burned me down
I never got over it
I never got over it

That when I went to hell, I was taking you with me

And it gets too deep
And there's no way that now you could rescue me

When I close my eyes
I'm fighting in the dark
Trying not to break your heart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me

Before you drown
I know that you won't understand

Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

Praying to a ghost, hoping he gets it

The last two pills I took haven't kicked in

Fuck it I'm young, I can act like an idiot
How many sins I gotta make till I get the hint?

Just fixed the labels till we breaking them deals, they gotta face it
Now I'm buzzing in my country, Harriet Tubman in my twenties
I been housing ever since I seen my name on them bills
They tell ya, ""Woo child, I'm amazing""
Look how I turned them hurricanes into a rain dance
Now them refugees is jealous, a bunch of gossip because of me
But you gon' have to tell me when my plane land
I mean, of course it's me, many endorsing me
I penciled in them gentlemen who opened doors for me
So Mr. Mikey, press record and sing them chords for me

Trying to make sense of it all, through a veil of tears
Somehow you're holding on
Trying to seek His face, but a thousand prayers
Don't make Him seem closer at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Let your seed of faith
Trust His word's still true

[Chorus]
Right now your fears are bigger than your faith
Right now your tears fall like endless rain
Right now your shoulders carry heavy weight
And right now, He hasn't changed
He's still good, and He's still God

[Verse 2]
Lies try to keep you bound, see them as they are
Bring them into the light
Even a glimpse of truth can break unbelief
And strengthen you in the fight, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So lеt your eyes of faith
See your risen King

[Chorus]
Right now your fеars are bigger than your faith
Right now your tears fall like endless rain
Right now your shoulders carry heavy weight
And right now, He hasn't changed
He's still good, and He's still God

[Bridge]
Every trial you face
And every pain you feel
One day you will see
They weave the tapestry, of Christ's love
They weave the tapestry, of Christ's love

[Chorus]
Right now your fears are bigger than your faith
Right now your tears fall like endless rain
Right now your shoulders carry heavy weight
And right now, He hasn't changed
He's still good, and He's still God
He's still good, and He's still God
He's still good, and He's still God
He's still good, and He's still God

It was a time where nothing ever happened
Drank too much wine, spent dreary nights alone
Feeling uninspired from awhile his eyes, I was too downcast for love
I couldn't, I couldn’t move on

It was a thing like something from the movies
Not just a fling, a random escapade
Suddenly aware, I could only stare at the face in front of me
I didn't, I didn't know what to do

Anyone who looks can clearly see (It’s love!)
I loved you then, I always will
And how I adore that you love me (Di-dee-oh!)

It was a night of stars aglow with secrets
My heart it flied, the fire burned below
I cannot recall how you altered all the assumptions I have made
I didn't, I didn't want you to go!

Anyone who looks can clearly see (It's love!)
I loved you then, I always will

But when it’s late at night and I’m running through your brain
Wondering if I could have been your very best mistake
You don’t love me, you just love when other people say
“Oh my god, they’re cute together”

[Chorus]
I tried to give you the world but you wanted Mars too
No one who I could’ve been was good enough for you
You say “I love you"" but you don’t believe it
You say “I love you"" but it don’t mean shit
I tried to give you the world but you wanted Mars too
You wanted Mars

[Refrain]
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
You wanted Mars

Na na na na na
Na na na na na

You broke my heart so carelessly
Why would you do this to me?
Now I feel like I can't see

Swallow, you're swallowing me
Hollow, no space in between

Everyone, everyone, everyone close to me is gone
Day dreams of reality, losing my sanity
Anyone, anyone, can anyone help me fix what's wrong
I'm having trouble moving on

It's 4:10 in the morning, I can't stop myself from mourning
From the lack of sleep and how I couldn't eat
The silence of the room creeps over me
Dreams provide a place, for the bitter side of me

Swallow, you're swallowing me
Hollow, no space in between

Everyone, everyone, everyone close to me is gone
Day dreams of reality, losing my sanity
Anyone, anyone, can anyone help me fix what's wrong
I'm having trouble moving on

Everyone, everyone, everyone close to me is gone
Day dreams of reality, losing my sanity

Swallow, you're swallowing me

597,24821,Clear,Pusher,"[Verse 1: Mothica]
Words fall out of my mouth
They drift to the ground and they don't make a sound

I'll try to assemble them back to the place in my head
But I fear that I lack
The proper speak that I need
To narrate the scene
To tell you these things
The proper place for my thoughts
I know that I'm not
And you know that I'm not

[Chorus: Mothica]
So clear and transparent
Well I'll try but I can't promise it
So dark but delicate
Well I'm rough around the edges and
You can try to smooth me down
But I’m not, no, I’m not it
And you can try to smooth me down
But I’m not ready to forget
You can try to smooth me down
But I’m not, no, I’m not it
And you can try to smooth me down
But I’m not ready to forget
You can try to smooth me down
You can try to smooth me down
But I’m not ready to forget

[Verse 2: Mothica]
Take back all that I've said
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again
It’s not like me to pretend
But the best part of me is the worst I can give
But you make me so terrified
I tried to reply but I’m shaking inside
You gave me a tongue just to tie
I’ll swallow my pride if you swear not to lie

[Bridge: Mothica]
Hard to read and hard to speak to
But don’t take my word
Cause I’m honestly so bored of being misunderstood
I’m not

[Chorus: Mothica]
So clear and transparent
Well I'll try but I can't promise it
So dark but delicate
Well I'm rough around the edges and
You can try to smooth me down
But I’m not, no, I’m not it
And you can try to smooth me down
But I’m not ready to forget

598,24819,One Night,Matthew Koma,"You think you’re the new sexy
In a white Mercedes that bends me to the grave
You make casual messy
And all materials possess you like a slave
You’re custom made
Don’t take this swim for more than it is
It’s one night one night one night

Chew my love
Under your tongue
Like it’s your bubblegum
You’re blowing bubbles
‘Till the taste is gone
Are you coming over for the night
Just one night one night one night

Chew my love
Under your tongue
Like it’s your bubblegum
Just spit me out
When it becomes more than fun
Cause I’m coming over for the night
Just one night one night one night

Conversation is violent
Baby you’re too digital
8 bit dated physical
But keep me under your ceiling
Cause your concrete’s cheapening
Crumbling like Greece on me, oh no
Don’t take this swim for more than it is
It’s one night one night one night

Chew my love

Like it’s your bubblegum
You’re blowing bubbles
‘Till the taste is gone
Are you coming over for the night

Chew my love
Under your tongue
Like it’s your bubblegum
Just spit me out
When it becomes more than fun
Cause I’m coming over for the night
Just one night one night one night

Now I’ll pull you in close
It's the sweetest sour high
When you promise not to try
If I promise that ill lie
We could drink the punch for this One last time
Just one more last time

Chew my love
Under your tongue
Like it’s your bubblegum
You’re blowing bubbles
‘Till the taste is gone
Are you coming over for the night
Just one night one night one night

Chew my love
Under your tongue
Like it’s your bubblegum
Just spit me out
When it becomes more than fun
Cause I’m coming over for the night
Just one night one night one night
One night one night one night
One night

Just spit me out when it becomes more than fun

Always tripping over nothing
But nothing's on the floor
I swear the time it takes
To congregate and conversate
Just so things don't complicate
I just don't have the time of day

She just moving lips, moving lips
Talking 'bout stupid shit, stupid shit
And she don't know how to keep the man

And you really know already what I'm gonna drop
Hella money, mami wanna come up to the top
I walk a little closer then I do my Diddy bop
I love the way she moving and the way she make it pop
And I'm loving the way that you're making it bounce and you're moving it, doing it
See the way that you're breaking it down, the way you got them all losing it
Get it, lit, shake it, shake it
Bounce, turn up, level, level

I used to sip on the codeine
And use it to seal when i roll weed aye
I used to trap by my lonely
I used to trap with my homies aye
Doublewide days with the whoadies
We just kept poin we just kept smokin aye

I flex every day of the week
Yo bitch love the J's on my feet
And she love the taste of the weed
If i want her promise she stayin with me
I used to trap by my lonely
Too much attention from police
My name in the system they want me
Back in the cell but thats one place that i won't be
Now i just hustle these verses
If you want features then you must purchase
Bring the toe tag and cash to me in person
These beats were murdered put em in the furnace
I used to trap out that trailer
Hiding a stash of that paper
Totin the weapon no tazer
Poin the purple i love the flavor
Now ive got too much at risk
I worked my whole life for this
These ain't just words lil bitch
This just the way that i lived
I done rose up from the trench
I done po'd up with the drip
I done got caught with a zip
That year on papers was really a trip
I learned my lesson but i keep smokin know i be stressin aye
My squads been tested through the worst and some people left us aye
The people who stayed hoodlum reppin gone be with me when i get wealthy aye
I got these hands fuck a weapon i will roll up if you disrespecting aye

I dont fuck with opps hoodlum squad all i need
I dont trust a thot they tryna smoke all of my weed
I dont fuck with the cops they tryna stop my dream
I dont wanna talk rather show you who i be
Young white boy from them funk city 'jects
She dont fuck with me she just want my checks
But i dont fuck with her i just want the neck
She dont get shit but my kids on her chest
Hoodlum what i rep
South side im from the tex
Free s p mex
And im finally out of debt
All the birds in the city finally comin out they nest
Big homie paid respect and im feelin truly blessed
Hella Sprite 2 soundin like a greatest hits
I got off the papers and i ain't been sober since
I been makin moves you ain't been makin shit
Back in the day i would make my franklins flip
But now i gotta move a lil different
Still getting all of these people addicted aye
But no longer with prescriptions
Now its with the bars that i be spittin aye
Now that im gettin attention
Its seems the vibe of bitches has shifted aye
I stay in the clouds yeah im lifted
Promethazine prince is still sippin aye
They say violence ain't the answer
If you ask me weakness is cancer aye
I drive on yo block with the hammer
I hit them folks but im not a dancer aye
Won't fuck yo bitch i got standards
But they be missin when im off them xannies aye
Dont disrespect me wheres your manners
Dont make me risk time in the slammer aye

House music
Well, my definition of house music
Is what comes from the soul
(Is what comes from the soul, is what comes from the soul)
And you may call it house 'cause it's not a serious production
Or has to be planned
It's just how you feel
When you wanna say something you just say it

Like if you wanna say 'freedom, I do believe in freedom
Freedom', yeah, something like that

Join hands
House music

What is house music?
A unique form of music that gives complete freedom of expression
It's not with a continual form of something that you do continually
But it's just something that, it's real simple
And it just deals with, anybody can understand it

681,24941,Beg,Yousef,"I can't sleep at all
I'm making late night calls
Just to talk to you and hear your voice again
That flower shop on Main
Knows me by my first name
And how I want the card to read
And where I want the roses sent

I'm not saying I'm in love
I'd admit it if I was
I'm just saying I believe
You're beginning to get to me
The way I need you all the time
The way you hold this heart of mine
I think it's time that I concede
You're beginning to get to me

I've got your picture up
On the dash of my new truck
So I can have you with me every road I'm on
Babe, if what I feel
Is just a tip of what I will
I can only guess what I'll be like
When I'm completely gone

I'm not saying I'm in love
I'd admit it if I was
I'm just saying I believe
You're beginning to get to me
The way I need you all the time
The way you hold this heart of mine
I think it's time that I concede
You're beginning to get to me

I'm not saying I'm in love

She tried the last one on
It couldn't speak, fell off
And now she just wanders the halls
Thinking nothing‚ thinking nothing at all

Once there was a man
Who had a little too much time on his hands
He never stopped to think that he was getting older
When his night came to an end
He tried to grasp for his last friend and pretend
That he could wish himself health on a four-leaf clover

695,24952,Noise,Denis Horvat,"[Letra de ""Calaveras"" Ceda ft. Rapiphero]

[Verso: Rapiphero]
En mi cabeza a punto de romperse un dique
Yo en medio de la lucha del burgués y el bolchevique
La vida de frenones y piques, en el sendero de Caín
En mi psique van lo bondadoso y lo vil

Soy un país en plena guerra civil
Si hay un camino hacia la paz, no hay religión que me lo indique
Y en mi corazón hay un motín porque una parte te quiere y la otra no confía en ti

Me quedé con la segunda y desde ahí el sinsabor de no tener ni idea de cómo cantarle al desamor, (ya)
Y fue verdad lo que dijo Lavoe:
¿cuánto vale un cielo azul si a un día le faltase el sol?

¿cuánto vale una pasión si se convierte en obsesión?
Cuando la fe falla y la boca se calla, todo acabó
Hoy en una sola figura soy el bueno, soy el malo, soy el feo
Soy la verdad, soy la mentira, soy la duda
Hasta la sepultura llevaré mis ataduras
Quise ser un libro abierto, quise pedir ayuda
Pero sigo siendo un cerrado con portada de pasta dura

Y ahora, al momento en que me llegue la hora del foto-finish
No quiero morir como Iván Illich, acostado mirando el respaldar del sofá
Mirando cómo la vida se va sin oportunidad de ser feliz

Estoy seguro que quien todo lo merece no es quien ambiciona sino quien más agradece, cuando de cosas buenas parece, todo careces porque en la oscuridad es donde una semilla crece y…

[Coro]
Para vivir hay infinitas maneras
Unos entre libros y poemas
Otros entre balaceras
Unos buscando el amor
Otros buscando rameras
En el fondo todos somos calaveras

[Verso: Rapiphero]
Elige: Jean-Paul Sartre o Jean-Paul Gaultier
Ya tú verás, quieres bendiciones delos de más
Me dan igual tus Dolces & Gabbanas, quita
Vine a vivir la dolce vita; nada más yeah!
Reportando Daniel o Denis demenas
Flow no como Lil Wayne con Nicki Minaj
I know, I can como Nas, aunque el mundo tiene
Una ballena para cada Jonas

(El mundo al que te enfrentas,es el mismo mundo que te inventas)
(El mundo al que te enfrentas,es el mismo mundo que te inventas)

[Coro]
Para vivir hay infinitas maneras pero, en el fondo todos somos calaveras, sí
Para vivir hay infinitas maneras pero, en el fondo todos somos calaveras, sí
Para vivir hay infinitas maneras

696,24955,Downpipe,Mark Knight,"To the music of falling water
And I don't mean rain

Don't give me that pain
Don't corner me with that poetry thing

At the edge of the world
The red earth and ocean are below me
Locked in a distance of erosion
Put a rock on me to stop me blowin' away

And the sky comes down to the ground
Letting go with love
And a cell phone rings, rings, rings

Las Vegas in my head
Tattoo on my mind
Black brick black brick walls slide
Past your, past your tired eyes
I'm on a short fuse
I'm on a good day, but
I'm on a short fuse
I'm sure that you could guess see me
Woman with a small vise saying
Shall we have a coffee
Somewhere sometime somehow
When you come, come, come, come with me
Sounds like I, sounds like I
Found my mistake

I'm gonna make you shake
I'm gonna make your hand shake

I'm gonna make you shake
I'm gonna make your hand shake

702,24975,Good Time,Nexeri,"[Refrain]
I spent my life making bad luck in the good times
Looking back where I was taking the good things with the bad
For all I've lost, seen this far make me realize I have
I wanna live my days in vain but very far make me smile again
Seems like a natural thing to do, just remember

[Verse 1]
Steady on my mind
Bad luck, good times
For me it happens in the morning when I’m waiting for lights
I start thinking if he wrote my script different
Pictures with the brush lets spray in this missed our existence
Never gone as far to say I wished on a star
But I could say I wished for a car
Simple traits of us, people thinking too small
Now I realize the blink of an eye, the medicine sink in us all
Sink a swim till the season is fall, then it’s gone to November
But remember that December will call
Permanent, not as long as some might think
Last week I cleaned up some permanent ink
Oh, I’m on the verge of a break
There’s something new before the sky might fall and earth sinks
I sat down and played the cards I’m dealt
Some good, some bad, and still the message was felt
These are good times

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh it was 20/20 vision then, before the catch you and closed
The audience was listening
Oh that’s the purpose of reflecting
The purpose of a wordsmith's pen bleeding ink till my sketches permanent
I put the madness to the method
Round the same time Common dropped the Resurrection classic
I was still tripping off tabs of bad acid
Dreaming about my own rap disc in plastic
Selling demos back then became a lonely trail
Always got denied by the homie with the pony tail
Chalk that one up as that's part of the game, right
Looking back I'd do that shit the same
The same time my mom was leaving my pops
Was around the same time Neil Diamond sang Love on the Rocks
Make yourself a good day cause no one will do this besides yourself
Think about those words
Each time when you’re about to lose a good time

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You never know, you never know, you never know
Good times is how I’m living it up
With my glass half full is how I’m viewing the cup
It went from when it's over to holding on a four leaf clover
Trying to find lady luck, where she at
I'm stuck, seeing birds eye from 6'2""
So I keep getting high, trying to lift my view
It’s funny how gotta pay bills can build the fan base
I love the road but ain't losing my land and that's damn straight
I make a plan and at least one I set a day
I'm not quite ike but still draw from my anime
I keep it moving and I plan to stay til the camera pans away
These are good times, I walk the street with a bye
And everything I did in the name of that high
Whether I flopped or I sold a million
Got booed at every single solitary hand up towards the ceiling
These are good times

Judging from recent conversations among third-world intellectuals, there is now an obsessive return of the national situation itself, the name of the country that returns again and again like a gong, the collective attention to ""us"" and what we have to do and how we do it, to what we can't do and what we do better than this or that nationality, our unique characteristics, in short, to the level of the ""people."" This is not the way American intellectuals have been discussing ""America,"" and indeed one might feel that the whole matter is nothing but that old thing called ""nationalism,"" long since liquidated here and rightly so. Yet a certain nationalism is fundamental in the third world {and also in the most vital areas of the second world), thus making it legitimate to ask whether it is all that bad in the end.(1) Does in fact the message of some disabused and more experienced first-world wisdom (that of Europe even more than of the United States) consist in urging these nation states to outgrow it as fast as possible? The predictable reminders of Kampuchea and of Iraq and Iran do not really seem to me to settle anything or suggest by what these nationalisms might be replaced except perhaps some global American postmodernist culture.

Many arguments can be made for the importance and interest of non­ canonical forms of literature such as that of the third world (2), but one is peculiarly self-defeating because it borrows the weapons of the adversary: the strategy of trying to prove that these texts are as ""great"" as those of the canon itself. The object is then to show that, to take an example from another non-canonical form, Dashiell Hammett is really as great as Dostoyevsky, and therefore can be admitted. This is to attempt dutifully to wish away all traces of that ""pulp"" format which is constitutive of sub-genres, and it invites immediate failure insofar as any passionate reader of Dostoyevsky will know at once, after a few pages, that those kinds of satisfactions are not present. Nothing is to be gained by passing over in silence the radical difference of non-canonical texts. The third-world novel will not offer the satisfactions of Proust or Joyce; what is more damaging than that, perhaps, is its tendency to remind us of outmoded stages of our own first-world cultural development and to cause us to conclude that ""they are still writing novels like Dreiser or Sherwood Anderson.""

A case could be built on this kind of discouragement, with its deep existential commitment to a rhythm of modernist innovation if not fashion-changes; but it

66

would not be a moralizing-historicist one, rather, which challenges our imprisonment in the present of postmodernism and calls for a reinvention of the radical difference of our own cultural past and its now seemingly old-fashioned situations and novelties.

But I would rather argue all this a different way, at least for now (3), these reactions to third-world texts are at one and the same time perfectly natural, perfectly comprehensible, and terribly parochial. If the purpose of the canon is to restrict our aesthetic sympathies, to develop a range of rich and subtle perceptions which can be exercised only on the occasion of a small but choice body of texts, to discourage us from reading anything else or from reading those things in different ways, then it is humanly impoverishing. Indeed our want of sympathy for these often unmodern third-world texts is itself frequently but a disguise for some deeper fear of the affluent about the way people actually live in other parts of the world-a way of life that still has little in common with daily life in the American suburb. There is nothing particularly disgraceful in having lived a sheltered life, in never having had to confront the difficulties, the complications and the frustrations of urban living, but it is nothing to be particularly proud of either. Moreover, a limited experience of life normally does not make for a wide range of sympathies with very different kinds of people (I'm thinking of differences that range from gender and race all the way to those of social class and culture).

The way in which all this affects the reading process seems to be as follows: as western readers whose tastes (and much else) have been formed by our own modernisms, a popular or socially realistic third-world novel tends to come before us, not immediately, but as though already-read. We sense, between ourselves and this alien text, the presence of another reader, of the Other reader, for whom a narrative, which strikes us as conventional or naive, has a freshness of information and a social interest that we cannot share. The fear and the resistance I'm evoking has to do, then, with the sense of our own non-coincidence with that Other reader, so different from ourselves; our sense that to coincide in any adequate way with that Other ""ideal reader""--that is to say, to read this text adequately--we would have to give up a great deal that is individually precious to us and acknowledge an existence and a situation unfamiliar and therefore frightening--one that we do not know and prefer not to know.

Why, returning to the question of the canon, should we only read certain kinds of books? No one is suggesting we should not read those, but why should we not also read other ones? We are not, after all, being shipped to that ""desert island"" beloved of the devisers of great books lists. And as a matter of fact--and this is to me the conclusive nail in the argument--we all do ""read"" many different kinds of texts in this life of ours, since, whether we are willing to admit it or not, we spend much of our existence in the force field of a mass culture that is radically

67

different from our ""great books"" and live at least a double life in the various compartments of our unavoidably fragmented society. We need to be aware that we are even more fundamentally fragmented than that; rather than clinging to this particular mirage of the ""centered subject"" and the unified personal identity, we would do better to confront honestly the fact of fragmentation on a global scale; it is a confrontation with which we can here at least make a cultural beginning.

A final observation on my use of the term ""third world."" I take the point of criticisms of this expression, particularly those which stress the way in which it obliterates profound differences between a whole range of non-western countries and situations (indeed, one such fundamental opposition--between the traditions of the great eastern empires and those of the post-colonial African nation states­-is central in what follows). I don't, however, see any comparable expression that articulates, as this one does, the fundamental breaks between the capitalist first world, the socialist bloc of the second world, and a range of other countries which have suffered the experience of colonialism and imperialism. One can only deplore the ideological implications of oppositions such as that between ""developed"" and ""underdeveloped"" or ""developing"" countries; while the more recent conception of northern and southern tiers, which has a very different ideological content and import than the rhetoric of development, and is used by very different people, nonetheless implies an unquestioning acceptance of ""convergence theory""-- namely the idea that the Soviet Union and the United States are from this perspective largely the same thing. I am using the term ""third world"" in an essentially descriptive sense, and objections to it do not strike me as especially relevant to the argument I am making.

* * *

In these last years of the century, the old question of a properly world literature reasserts itself. This is due as much or more to the disintegration of our own conceptions of cultural study as to any very lucid awareness of the great outside world around us. We may therefore--as ""humanists""--acknowledge the pertinence of the critique of present-day humanities by our titular leader, William Bennett, without finding any great satisfaction in his embarrassing solution: yet another impoverished and ethnocentric Graeco-Judaic ""great books list of the civilization of the West,"" ""great texts, great minds, great ideas.""(4) One is tempted to turn back on Bennett himself the question he approvingly quotes from Maynard Mack: ""How long can a democratic nation afford to support a narcissistic minority so transfixed by its own image?"" Nevertheless, the present moment does offer a remarkable opportunity to rethink our humanities curriculum in a new way--to re-examine the shambles and ruins of all our older ""great books,"" ""humanities,"" ""freshman-introductory"" and ""core course"" type traditions.

68

Today the reinvention of cultural studies in the United States demands the reinvention, in a new situation, of what Goethe long ago theorized as ""world literature."" In our more immediate context, then, any conception of world literature necessarily demands some specific engagement with the question of third­world literature, and it is this not necessarily narrower subject about which I have something to say today.

It would be presumptuous to offer some general theory of what is often called third-world literature, given the enormous variety both of national cultures in the third world and of specific historical trajectories in each of those areas. All of this, then, is provisional and intended both to suggest specific perspectives for research and to convey a sense of the interest and value of these clearly neglected literatures for people formed by the values and stereotypes of a first-world culture. One important distinction would seem to impose itself at the outset, namely that none of these cultures can be conceived as anthropologically independent or autonomous, rather, they are all in various distinct ways locked in a life-and-death struggle with first-world cultural imperialism--a cultural struggle that is itself a reflection of the economic situation of such areas in their penetration by various stages of capital, or as it is sometimes euphemistically termed, of modernization. This, then, is some first sense in which a study of third-world culture necessarily entails a new view of ourselves, from the outside, insofar as we ourselves are (perhaps without fully knowing it) constitutive forces powerfully at work on the remains of older cultures in our general world capitalist system.

But if this is the case, the initial distinction that imposes itself has to do with the nature and development of older cultures at the moment of capitalist penetration, something it seems to me most enlightening to examine in terms of the marxian concept of modes of production.(5) Contemporary historians seem to be in the process of reaching a consensus on the specificity of feudalism as a form which, issuing from the break-up of the Roman Empire or the Japanese Shogunate, is able to develop directly into capitalism.(6) This is not the case with the other modes of production, which in some sense must be disaggregated or destroyed by violence, before capitalism is able to implant its specific forms and displace the older ones. In the gradual expansion of capitalism across the globe, then, our economic system confronts two very distinct modes of production that pose two very different types of social and cultural resistance to its influence. These are so-called primitive, or tribal society on the one hand, and the Asiatic mode of production, or the great bureaucratic imperial systems, on the other. African societies and cultures, as they became the object of systematic colonization in the 1880s, provide the most striking examples of the symbiosis of capital and tribal societies; while China and India offer the principal examples of another and quite different sort of engagement of capitalism with the great empires of the so-called

69

Asiatic mode. My examples below, then, will be primarily African and Chinese; however, the special case of Latin America must be noted in passing. Latin America offers yet a third kind of development--one involving an even earlier destruction of imperial systems now projected by collective memory back into the archaic or tribal. Thus the earlier nominal conquests of independence open them at once to a kind of indirect economic penetration and control--something Africa and Asia will come to experience only more recently with decolonization in the
1950s and 60s.

Having made these initial distinctions, let me now, by way of a sweeping hypothesis, try to say what all third-world cultural productions seem to have in common and what distinguishes them radically from analogous cultural forms in the first world. All third-world texts are necessarily, I want to argue, allegorical, and in a very specific way: they are to be read as what I will call national allegories, even when, or perhaps I should say, particularly when their forms develop out of predominantly western machineries of representation, such as the novel. Let me try to state this distinction in a grossly oversimplified way: one of the determinants of capitalist culture, that is, the culture of the western realist and modernist novel, is a radical split between the private and the public, between the poetic and the political, between what we have come to think of as the domain of sexuality and the unconscious and that of the public world of classes, of the economic, and of secular political power: in other words, Freud versus Marx. Our numerous theoretical attempts to overcome this great split only reconfirm its existence and its shaping power over our individual and collective lives. We have been trained in a deep cultural conviction that the lived experience of our private existences is somehow incommensurable with the abstractions of economic science and politi­ cal dynamics. Politics in our novels therefore is, according to Stendhal's canonical formulation, a ""pistol shot in the middle of a concert.""

I will argue that, although we may retain for convenience and for analysis such categories as the subjective and the public or political, the relations between them are wholly different in third-world culture. Third-world texts, even those which are seemingly private and invested with a properly libidinal dynamic­ necessarily project a political dimension in the form of national allegory: the story of the private individual destiny is always an allegory of the embattled situation of the public third-world culture and society. Need I add that it is precisely this very different ratio of the political to the personal which makes such texts alien to us at first approach, and consequently, resistant to our conventional western habits of reading?

I will offer, as something like the supreme example of this process of allegori­ zation, the first masterwork of China's greatest writer, Lu Xun, whose neglect in western cultural studies is a matter of shame which no excuses based on ignorance

70

can rectify. ""Diary of a Madman"" (1918) must at first be read by any western reader as the protocol of what our essentially psychological language terms a ""nervous breakdown."" It offers the notes and perceptions of a subject in intensify­ ing prey to a terrifying psychic delusion, the conviction that the people around him are concealing a dreadful secret, and that that secret can be none other than the increasingly obvious fact that they are cannibals. At the climax of the development of the delusion, which threatens his own physical safety and his very life itself as a potential victim, the narrator understands that his own brother is himself a cannibal and that the death of their little sister, a number of years earlier, far from being the result of childhood illness, as he had thought, was in reality a murder. As befits the protocol of a psychosis, these perceptions are objective ones, which can be rendered without any introspective machinery: the paranoid subject observes sinister glances around him in the real world, he overhears tell-tale conversations between his brother and an alleged physician (obviously in reality another cannibal) which carry all the conviction of the real, and can be objectively (or ""realistically"") represented. This is not the place to demonstrate in any detail the absolute pertinence, to Lu Xun's case history, of the pre-eminent western or first-world reading of such phenomena, namely Freud's interpretation of the paranoid delusions of Senatspräsident Schreber: an emptying of the world, a radical withdrawal of libido (what Schreber describes as ""world-catastrophe""), followed by the attempt to recathect by the obviously imperfect mechanisms of paranoia. ""The delusion-formation,"" Freud explains, ""which we take to be a pathological product, is in reality an attempt at recovery, a process of reconstruction.""(7)

What is reconstructed, however, is a grisly and terrifying objective real world beneath the appearances of our own world: an unveiling or deconcealment of the nightmarish reality of things, a stripping away of our conventional illusions or rationalizations about daily life and existence. It is a process comparable, as a literary effect, only to some of the processes of western modernism, and in particu­ lar of existentialism, in which narrative is employed as a powerful instrument for the experimental exploration of reality and illusion, an exploration which, how­ ever, unlike some of the older realisms, presupposes a certain prior ""personal knowledge."" The reader must, in other words, have had some analogous experience, whether in physical illness or psychic crisis, of a lived and balefully trans­ formed real world from which we cannot even mentally escape, for the full horror of Lu Xun's nightmare to be appreciated. Terms like ""depression"" deform such experience by psychologizing it and projecting it back into the pathological Other; while the analogous western literary approaches to this same experience--I'm thinking of the archetypal deathbed murmur of Kurtz, in Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" ""The horror! the horror!""--recontains precisely that horror by transforming it into a rigorously private and subjective ""mood,"" which can only be

71

designated by recourse to an aesthetic of expression--the unspeakable, unnameable inner feeling, whose external formulation can only designate it from without, like a symptom.

But this representational power of Lu Xun's text cannot be appreciated prop­erly without some sense of what I have called its allegorical resonance. For it should be clear that the cannibalism literally apprehended by the sufferer in the attitudes and bearing of his family and neighbors is at one and the same time being attributed by Lu Xun himself to Chinese society as a whole: and if this attribution is to be called ""figural,"" it is indeed a figure more powerful and ""literal"" than the ""literal"" level of the text. Lu Xun's proposition is that the people of this great maimed and retarded, disintegrating China of the late and post-imperial period, his fellow citizens, are ""literally"" cannibals: in their desperation, disguised and indeed intensified by the most traditional forms and procedures of Chinese culture, they must devour one another ruthlessly to stay alive. This occurs at all levels of that exceedingly hierarchical society, from lumpens and peasants all the way to the most privileged elite positions in the mandarin bureaucracy. It is, I want to stress, a social and historical nightmare, a vision of the horror of life specifically grasped through History itself, whose consequences go far beyond the more local western realistic or naturalistic representation of cut-throat capitalist or market competition, and it exhibits a specifically political resonance absent from its natural or mythological western equivalent in the nightmare of Darwinian natural selection.

Now I want to offer four additional remarks about this text, which will touch, respectively, on the libidinal dimension of the story, on the structure of its allegory, on the role of the third-world cultural producer himself, and on the perspective of futurity projected by the tale's double resolution. I will be concerned, in dealing with all four of these topics, to stress the radical structural difference between the dynamics of third-world culture and those of the first-world cultural tradition in which we have ourselves been formed.

I have suggested that in third-world texts such as this story by Lu Xun the relationship between the libidinal and the political components of individual and social experience is radically different from what obtains in the west and what shapes our own cultural forms. Let me try to characterize this difference, or if you like this radical reversal, by way of the following generalization: in the west, conventionally, political commitment is recontained and psychologized or subjectivized by way of the public-private split I have already evoked. Interpretations, for example, of political movements of the 60s in terms of Oedipal revolts are familiar to everyone and need no further comment. That such interpretations are episodes in a much longer tradition, whereby political commitment is re-psychologized and accounted for in terms of the subjective dynamics of ressentiment or the authorita-

72

rian personality, is perhaps less well understood, but can be demonstrated by a careful reading of anti-political texts from Nietzsche and Conrad all the way to the latest cold-war propaganda.

What is relevant to our present context is not, however, the demonstration of that proposition, but rather of its inversion in third-world culture, where I want to suggest that psychology, or more specifically, libidinal investment, is to be read in primarily political and social terms. (It is, I hope, unnecessary to add that what follows is speculative and very much subject to correction by specialists: it is offered as a methodological example rather than a ""theory"" of Chinese culture.) We're told, for one thing, that the great ancient imperial cosmologies identify by analogy what we in the west analytically separate: thus, the classical sex manuals are at one with the texts that reveal the dynamics of political forces, the charts of the heavens at one with the logic of medical lore, and so forth.(8) Here already then, in an ancient past, western antinomies--and most particularly that between the subjective and the public or political--are refused in advance. The libidinal center of Lu Xun's text is, however, not sexuality, but rather the oral stage, the whole bodily question of eating, of ingestion, devoration, incorporation, from which such fundamental categories as the pure and the impure spring. We must now recall, not merely the extraordinary symbolic complexity of Chinese cuisine, but also the central role this art and practice occupies in Chinese culture as a whole. When we find that centrality confirmed by the observation that the very rich Chinese vocabulary for sexual matters is extraordinarily intertwined with the language of eating; and when we observe the multiple uses to which the verb ""to eat"" is put in ordinary Chinese language (one ""eats"" a fear or a fright, for example), we may feel in a somewhat better position to sense the enormous sensitivity of this libidinal region, and of Lu Xun's mobilization of it for the dramatization of an essentially social nightmare-something which in a western writer would be consigned to the realm of the merely private obsession, the vertical dimension of the personal trauma.

A different alimentary transgression can be observed throughout Lu Xun's works, but nowhere quite so strikingly as in his terrible little story, ""Medicine."" The story portrays a dying child--the death of children is a constant in these works--whose parents have the good fortune to procure an ""infallible"" remedy. At this point we must recall both that traditional Chinese medicine is not ""taken,"" as in the west, but ""eaten,"" and that for Lu Xun traditional Chinese medicine was the supreme locus of the unspeakable and exploitative charlatanry of traditional Chinese culture in general. In his crucially important Preface to the first collection of his stories,(9) he recounts the suffering and death of his own father from tuberculosis, while declining family reserves rapidly disappeared into the purchase of expensive and rare, exotic and ludicrous medicaments. We will not sense the

73

symbolic significance of this indignation unless we remember that for all these reasons Lu Xun decided to study western medicine in Japan--the epitome of some new western science that promised collective regeneration--only later to decide that the production of culture--I am tempted to say, the elaboration of a political culture--was a more effective form of political medicine.(10) As a writer, then, Lu Xun remains a diagnostician and a physician. Hence this terrible story, in which the cure for the male child, the father's only hope for survival in future generations, turns out to be one of those large doughy-white Chinese steamed rolls, soaked in the blood of a criminal who has just been executed. The child dies anyway, of course, but it is important to note that the hapless victim of a more properly state violence (the supposed criminal) was a political militant, whose grave is mysteriously covered in flowers by absent sympathizers of whom one knows nothing. In the analysis of a story like this, we must rethink our conventional conception of the symbolic levels of a narrative (where sexuality and politics might be in homology to each other, for instance) as a set of loops or circuits which intersect and overdetermine each other-the enormity of therapeutic cannibalism finally intersecting in a pauper's cemetery, with the more overt violence of family betrayal and political repression.

This new mapping process brings me to the cautionary remark I wanted to make about allegory itself-a form long discredited in the west and the specific target of the Romantic revolution of Wordsworth and Coleridge, yet a linguistic structure which also seems to be experiencing a remarkable reawakening of interest in contemporary literary theory. If allegory has once again become somehow congenial for us today, as over against the massive and monumental unifications of an older modernist symbolism or even realism itself, it is because the allegorical spirit is profoundly discontinuous, a matter of breaks and heterogeneities, of the multiple polysemia of the dream rather than the homogeneous representation of the symbol. Our traditional conception of allegory-based, for instance, on stereotypes of Bunyan, is that of an elaborate set of figures and personifications to be read against some one-to-one table of equivalences: this is, so to speak, a one-dimensional view of this signifying process, which might only be set in motion and complexified were we willing to entertain the more alarming notion that such equivalences are themselves in constant change and transformation at each perpetual present of the text.

Here too Lu Xun has some lessons for us. This writer of short stories and sketches, which never evolved into the novel form as such, produced at least one approach to the longer form, in a much lengthier series of anecdotes about a hapless coolie named Ah Q, who comes to serve, as we might have suspected, as the allegory of a certain set of Chinese attitudes and modes of behavior. It is interesting to note that the enlargement of the form determines a shift in tone or

74

generic discourse: now everything that had been stricken with the stillness and emptiness of death and suffering without hope-""the room was not only too silent, it was far too big as well, and the things in it were far too empty""(11) becomes material for a more properly Chaplinesque comedy. Ah Q's resiliency springs from an unusual-but we are to understand culturally very normal and familiar-technique for overcoming humiliation. When set upon by his persecutors, Ah Q, serene in his superiority over them, reflects: ""'It is as if I were beaten by my own son. What is the world coming to nowadays ...' Thereupon he too would walk away, satisfied at having won.""(12) Admit that you are not even human, they insist, that you are nothing but an animal! On the contrary, he tells them, I'm worse than an animal, I'm an insect! There, does that satisfy you?"" In less than ten seconds, however, Ah Q would walk away also satisfied that he had won, thinking that he was after all 'number one in self-belittlement,' and that after removing the 'self-belittlement' what remained was still the glory of remaining 'number one.""'(13). When one recalls the remarkable self-esteem of the Manchu dynasty in its final throes, and the serene contempt for foreign devils who had nothing but modern science, gunboats, armies, technology and power to their credit, one achieves a more precise sense of the historical and social topicality of Lu Xun's satire.

Ah Q is thus, allegorically, China itself. What I want to observe, however, what complicates the whole issue, is that his persecutors--the idlers and bullies who find their daily pleasures in getting a rise out of just such miserable victims as Ah Q--they too are China, in the allegorical sense. This very simple example, then, shows the capacity of allegory to generate a range of distinct meanings or messages, simultaneously, as the allegorical tenor and vehicle change places: Ah Q is China humiliated by the foreigners, a China so well versed in the spiritual techniques of self-justification that such humiliations are not even registered, let alone recalled. But the persecutors are also China, in a different sense, the terrible self-cannibalistic China of the ""Diary of a Madman,'' whose response to powerlessness is the senseless persecution of the weaker and more inferior members of the hierarchy.

All of which slowly brings us to the question of the writer himself in the third world, and to what must be called the function of the intellectual, it being under­ stood that in the third-world situation the intellectual is always in one way or another a political intellectual. No third-world lesson is more timely or more urgent for us today, among whom the very term ""intellectual"" has withered away, as though it were the name for an extinct species. Nowhere has the strangeness of this vacant position been brought home to me more strongly than on a recent trip to Cuba, when I had occasion to visit a remarkable college-preparatory school on the outskirts of Havana. It is a matter of some shame for an American to witness the cultural curriculum in a socialist setting which also very much identifies itself

75

with the third world. Over some three or four years, Cuban teenagers study poems of Homer, Dante's Inferno, the Spanish theatrical classics, the great realistic novels of the 19th-century European tradition, and finally contemporary Cuban revolutionary novels, of which, incidentally, we desperately need English translations. But the semester's work I found most challenging was one explicitly devoted to the study of the role of the intellectual as such: the cultural intellectual who is also a political militant, the intellectual who produces both poetry and praxis. The Cuban illustrations of this process--Ho Chi Minh and Augustino Nieto--are obviously enough culturally determined: our own equivalents would probably be the more familiar figures of DuBois and C.L.R. James, of Sartre and Neruda or Brecht, of Kollontai or Louise Michel. But as this whole talk aims implicitly at suggesting a new conception of the humanities in American education today, it is appropriate to add that the study of the role of the intellectual as such ought to be a key component in any such proposals.

I've already said something about Lu Xun's own conception of his vocation, and its extrapolation from the practice of medicine. But there is a great deal more to be said specifically about the Preface. Not only is it one of the fundamental documents for understanding the situation of the third world artist, it is also a dense text in its own right, fully as much a work of art as any of the greatest stories. And in Lu Xun's own work it is the supreme example of the very unusual ratio of subjective investment and a deliberately depersonalized objective narration. We have no time to do justice to those relationships, which would demand a line-by-line commentary. Yet I will quote the little fable by which Lu Xun, responding to requests for publication by his friends and future collaborators, dramatizes his dilemma:Imagine an iron house without windows, absolutely indestructible, with many people fast sleep inside who will shortly die of suffocation. But you know that since they will die in their sleep, they will not feel the pain of death. Now if you cry aloud to wake a few of the lighter sleepers, making those unfortunate few suffer the agony of irrevocable death, do you think you are doing them a good turn? (14)The seemingly hopeless situation of the third-world intellectual in this historical period (shortly after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, but also after the bankruptcy of the middle-class revolution had become apparent)--in which no solutions, no forms of praxis or change, seem conceivable-this situation will find its parallel, as we shall see shortly, in the situation of African intellectuals after the achievement of independence, when once again no political solutions seem present or visible on the historical horizon. The formal or literary manifestation of

76

this political problem is the possibility of narrative closure, something we will return to more specifically.

In a more general theoretical context--and it is this theoretical form of the problem I should now like at least to thematize and set in place on the agenda--we must recover a sense of what ""cultural revolution"" means, in its strongest form, in the marxist tradition. The reference is not to the immediate events of that violent and tumultuous interruption of the ""eleven years"" in recent Chinese history, al­ though some reference to Maoism as a doctrine is necessarily implicit. The term, we are told, was Lenin's own, and in that form explicitly designated the literacy campaign and the new problems of universal scholarity and education: something of which Cuba, again, remains the most stunning and successful example in recent history. We must, however, enlarge the conception still further, to include a range of seemingly very different preoccupations, of which the names of Gramsci and Wilhelm Reich, Frantz Fanon, Herbert Marcuse, Rudolph Bahro, and Paolo Freire, may give an indication of their scope and focus. Overhastily, I will suggest that ""cultural revolution"" as it is projected in such works turns on the phenomenon of what Gramsci called ""subalternity,"" namely the feelings of mental inferiority and habits of subservience and obedience which necessarily and structurally develop in situations of domination-most dramatically in the experience of colonized peoples. But here, as so often, the subjectivizing and psychologizing habits of first-world peoples such as ourselves can play us false and lead us into misunderstandings. Subalternity is not in that sense a psychological matter, although it governs psychologies; and I suppose that the strategic choice of the term ""cultural"" aims precisely at restructuring that view of the problem and projecting it outwards into the realm of objective or collective spirit in some non-psychological, but also non-reductionist or non-economistic, materialistic fashion. When a psychic structure is objectively determined by economic and political relation­ ships, it cannot be dealt with by means of purely psychological therapies; yet it equally cannot be dealt with by means of purely objective transformations of the economic and political situation itself, since the habits remain and exercise a baleful and crippling residual effect.(15) This is a more dramatic form of that old mystery, the unity of theory and practice; and it is specifically in the context of this problem of cultural revolution (now so strange and alien to us) that the achievements and failures of third-world intellectuals, writers and artists must be replaced if their concrete historical meaning is to be grasped. We have allowed ourselves, as first-world cultural intellectuals, to restrict our consciousness of our life's work to the narrowest professional or bureaucratic terms, thereby encouraging in ourselves a special sense of subalternity and guilt, which only reinforces the vicious circle. That a literary article could be a political act, with real consequences, is for most of us little more than a curiosity of the literary history of Czarist

77

Russia or of modern China itself. But we perhaps should also consider the possibility that as intellectuals we ourselves are at present soundly sleeping in that indestructable iron room, of which Lu Xun spoke, on the point of suffocation.

The matter of narrative closure, then, and of the relationship of a narrative text to futurity and to some collective project yet to come, is not, merely a formal or literary-critical issue. ""Diary of a Madman"" has in fact two distinct and incom­ patible endings, which prove instructive to examine in light of the writer's own hesitations and anxieties about his social role. One ending, that of the deluded subject himself, is very much a call to the future, in the impossible situation of a well-nigh universal cannibalism: the last desperate lines launched into the void are the words, ""Save the children.. ."" But the tale has a second ending as well, which is disclosed on the opening page, when the older (supposedly cannibalistic) brother greets the narrator with the following cheerful remark: ""I appreciate your coming such a long way to see us, but my brother recovered some time ago and has gone elsewhere to take up an official post."" So, in advance, the nightmare is annulled; the paranoid visionary, his brief and terrible glimpse of the grisly reality beneath the appearance now vouchsafed, gratefully returns to the realm of illusion and oblivion therein again to take up his place in the space of bureaucratic power and privilege. I want to suggest that it is only at this price, by way of a complex play of simultaneous and antithetical messages, that the narrative text is able to open up a concrete perspective on the real future.

* * *

I must interrupt myself here to interpolate several observations before proceeding. For one thing, it is clear to me that any articulation of radical difference-that of gender, incidentally, fully as much as that of culture, is susceptible to appropriation by that strategy of otherness which Edward Said, in the context of the Middle East, called ""orientalism."" It does not matter much that the radical otherness of the culture in question is praised or valorized positively, as in the preceding pages: the essential operation is that of differentiation, and once that has been accomplished, the mechanism Said denounces has been set in place. On the other hand, I don't see how a first-world intellectual can avoid this operation without falling back into some general liberal and humanistic universalism: it seems to me that one of our basic political tasks lies precisely in the ceaseless effort to remind the American public of the radical difference of other national situations.

But at this point one should insert a cautionary reminder about the dangers of the concept of ""culture"" itself: the very speculative remarks I have allowed myself to make about Chinese ""culture"" will not be complete unless I add that ""culture"" in this sense is by no means the final term at which one stops. One must imagine

78

such cultural structures and attitudes as having been themselves, in the beginning, vital responses to infrastructural realities (economic and geographic, for example), as attempts to resolve more fundamental contradictions--attempts which then outlive the situations for which they were devised, and survive, in reified forms, as ""cultural patterns."" Those patterns themselves then become part of the objective situation confronted by later generations, and, as in the case of Confucianism, having once been part of the solution to a dilemma, then become part of the new problem.

Nor can I feel that the concept of cultural ""identity"" or even national ""iden­tity"" is adequate. One cannot acknowledge the justice of the general poststructuralist assault on the so-called ""centered subject,"" the old unified ego of bourgeois individualism, and then resuscitate this same ideological mirage of psychic unification on the collective level in the form of a doctrine of collective identity. Appeals to collective identity need to be evaluated from a historical perspective, rather than from the standpoint of some dogmatic and placeless ""ideological analysis."" When a third-world writer invokes this (to us) ideological value, we need to examine the concrete historical situation closely in order to determine the political consequences of the strategic use of this concept. Lu Xun's moment, for example, is very clearly one in which a critique of Chinese ""culture"" and ""cultural identity"" has powerful and revolutionary consequences­ consequences which may not obtain in a later social configuration. This is then, perhaps, another and more complicated way of raising the issue of ""nationalism"" to which I referred earlier.

As far as national allegory is concerned, I think it may be appropriate to stress its presence in what is generally considered western literature in order to under­ score certain structural differences. The example I have in mind is the work of Benito Perez Galdos--the last and among the richest achievements of 19th century realism. Galdos' novels are more visibly allegorical (in the national sense) than most of their better-known European predecessors (16): something that might well be explained in terms of Immanuel Wallerstein's world-system terminology.(17) Although 19th century Spain is not strictly peripheral after the fashion of the countries we are here designating under the term third world, it is certainly semi­peripheral in his sense, when contrasted with England or France. It is therefore not terribly surprising to find the situation of the male protagonist of Fortunata y Jacinta (1887)--alternating between the two women of the title, between the wife and the mistress, between the woman of the upper-middle classes and the woman of the ""people""--characterized in terms of the nation-state itself, hesitating between the republican revolution of 1868 and the Bourbon restoration of 1873.(18) Here too, the same ""floating"" or transferable structure of allegorical reference detected in Ah Q comes into play: for Fortunata is also married, and the alterna-

79

tion of ""revolution"" and ""restoration"" is likewise adapted to her situation, as she leaves her legal home to seek her lover and then returns to it in abandonment.

What it is important to stress is not merely the wit of the analogy as Galdos uses it, but also its optional nature: we can use it to convert the entire situation of the novel into an allegorical commentary on the destiny of Spain, but we are also free to reverse its priorities and to read the political analogy as metaphorical decoration for the individual drama, and as a mere figural intensification of this last. Here, far from dramatizing the identity of the political and the individual or psychic, the allegorical structure tends essentially to separate these levels in some absolute way. We cannot feel its force unless we are convinced of the radical difference between politics and the libidinal: so that its operation reconfirms (rather than annuls) that split between public and private which was attributed to western civilization earlier in our discussion. In one of the more powerful contemporary denunciations of this split and this habit, Deleuze and Guattari argue for a conception of desire that is at once social and individual.How does a delirium begin? Perhaps the cinema is able to capture the movement of madness, precisely because it is not analytical or regressive, but explores a global field of coexistence. Witness a film by Nicholas Ray, supposedly represent­ ing the formation of a cortisone delirium: an overworked father, a high-school teacher who works overtime for a radio-taxi service and is being treated for heart trouble. He begins to rave about the educational system in general, the need to restore a pure race, the salvation of the social and moral order, then he passes to religion, the timeliness of a return to the Bible, Abraham. But what in fact did Abraham do? Well now, he killed or wanted to kill his son, and perhaps God's only error lies in having stayed his hand. But doesn't this man, the film's protagonist, have a son of his own? Hmmm. ... What the film shows so well, to the shame of psychiatrists, is that every delirium is first of all the investment of a field that is social, economic, political cultural, racial and racist, pedagogical, and religious: the delirious person applies a delirium to his family and his son that overreaches them on all sides. (19)I am not myself sure that the objective consequences of this essentially social and concrete gap, in first-world experience, between the public and the private can be abolished by intellectual diagnosis or by some more adequate theory of their deeper interrelationship. Rather, it seems to me that what Deleuze and Guattari are proposing here is a new and more adequate allegorical reading of this film. Such allegorical structures, then, are not so much absent from first-world cultural texts as they are unconscious, and therefore they must be deciphered by interpretive mechanisms that necessarily entail a whole social and historical critique of our current first-world situation. The point here is that, in distinction to the uncon-

80

scious allegories of our own cultural texts, third-world national allegories are conscious and overt: they imply a radically different and objective relationship of politics to libidinal dynamics.

* * *

Now, before turning to the African texts, I remind you of the very special occasion of the present talk, which is concerned to honor the memory of Robert C. Elliott and to commemorate his life's work. I take it that the very center of his two most important books, The Power of Satire and The Shape of Utopia,(20) is to be found in his path breaking association of satire and the utopian impulse as two seemingly antithetical drives (and literary discourses), which in reality replicate each other such that each is always secretly active within the other's sphere of influence. All satire, he taught us, necessarily carries a utopian frame of reference within itself; all utopias, no matter how serene or disembodied, are driven secretly by the satirist's rage at a fallen reality. When I spoke of futurity a moment ago, I took pains to withhold the world ""utopia,"" which in my language is another word for the socialist project.

But now I will be more explicit and take as my motto an astonishing passage from the novel Xala, by the great contemporary Senegalese novelist and film­ maker Ousmane Sembene. The title designates a ritual curse or affliction, of a very special kind, which has been visited on a prosperous and corrupt Senegalese businessman at the moment in which, at the height of his fortune, he takes to himself a beautiful young (third) wife. Shades of The Power of Satire!, the curse is of course, as you may have guessed, sexual impotence. The Hadj, the unfortunate hero of this novel, desperately explores a number of remedies, both western and tribal, to no avail, and is finally persuaded to undertake a laborious trip into the hinterland of Dakar to seek out a shaman of reputedly extraordinary powers. Here is the conclusion of his hot and dusty journey in a horse-drawn cart:As they emerged from a ravine, they saw conical thatched roofs, grey-black with weathering, standing out against the horizon in the middle of the empty plain. Free-ranging, skinny cattle with dangerous-looking horns fenced with one another to get at what little grass there was. No more than silhouettes in the distance, a few people were busy around the only well. The driver of the cart was in familiar territory and greeted people as they passed. Sereen Mada's house, apart from its imposing size, was identical in construction with all the others. It was situated in the center of the village whose huts were arranged in a semi-circle, which you entered by a single main entrance. The village had neither shop nor school nor dispensary; there was nothing at all attractive about it in fact [Gusmane concludes, then he adds, as if in afterthought, this searing line:] There was nothing at all attractive about it in fact. Its life was based on the principles of community interdependence. (21)81

Here, then, more emblematically than virtually any other text I know, the space of a past and future utopia--a social world of collective cooperation-is dramatically inserted into the corrupt and westernized money economy of the new post­ independence national or comprador bourgeoisie. Indeed, Ousmane takes pains to show us that the Hadj is not an industrialist, that his business is in no sense productive, but functions as a middle-man between European multinationals and local extraction industries. To this biographical sketch must be added a very significant fact: that in his youth, the Hadj was political, and spent some time in jail for his nationalist and pro-independence activities. The extraordinary satire of these corrupt classes (which Ousmane will extend to the person of Senghor him­ self in The Last of the Empire) is explicitly marked as the failure of the independence movement to develop into a general social revolution.

The fact of nominal national independence, in Latin America in the 19th century, in Africa in the mid-20th, puts an end to a movement for which genuine national autonomy was the only conceivable goal. Nor is this symbolic myopia the only problem: the African states also had to face the crippling effects of what Fanon prophetically warned them against--to receive independence is not the same as to take it, since it is in the revolutionary struggle itself that new social relationships and a new consciousness is developed. Here again the history of Cuba is instructive: Cuba was the last of the Latin American nations to win its freedom in the 19th century--a freedom which would immediately be taken in charge by another greater colonial power. We now know the incalculable role played in the Cuban Revolution of 1959 by the protracted guerrilla struggles of the late 19th century (of which the figure of Jose Martf is the emblem); contemporary Cuba would not be the same without that laborious and subterranean, one wants to say Thompsonian, experience of the mole of History burrowing through a lengthy past and creating its specific traditions in the process.

So it is that after the poisoned gift of independence, radical African writers like Ousmane, or like Ngugi in Kenya, find themselves back in the dilemma of Lu Xun, bearing a passion for change and social regeneration which has not yet found its agents. I hope it is clear that this is also very much an aesthetic dilemma, a crisis of representation: it was not difficult to identify an adversary who spoke another language and wore the visible trappings of colonial occupation. When those are replaced by your own people, the connections to external controlling forces are much more difficult to represent. The newer leaders may of course throw off their masks and reveal the person of the Dictator, whether in its older individual or newer military form: but this moment also determines problems of representation. The dictator novel has become a virtual genre of Latin American literature, and such works are marked above all by a profound and uneasy ambivalence, a deeper ultimate sympathy for the Dictator, which can perhaps only be properly accounted

82

for by some enlarged social variant of the Freudian mechanism of transference.(22)

The form normally taken by a radical diagnosis of the failures of contemporary third-world societies is, however, what is conventionally designated as ""cultural imperialism,"" a faceless influence without representable agents, whose literary expression seems to demand the invention of new forms: Manuel Puig's Betrayed by Rita Hayworth may be cited as one of the most striking and innovative of those. One is led to conclude that under these circumstances traditional realism is less effective than the satiric fable: whence to my mind the greater power of certain of Ousmane's narratives (besides Xala, we should mention The Money-Order) as over against Ngugi's impressive but problematical Petals of Blood.

With the fable, however, we are clearly back into the whole question of allegory. The Money-Order mobilizes the traditional Catch-22 dilemma--its hapless protagonist cannot cash his Parisian check without identity papers, but since he was born long before independence there are no documents, and meanwhile the money-order, uncashed, begins to melt away before an accumulation of new credits and new debts. I am tempted to suggest, anachronistically, that this work, published in 1965, prophetically dramatizes the greatest misfortune that can happen to a third-world country in our time, namely the discovery of vast amounts of oil resources-something which as economists have shown us, far from representing salvation, at once sinks them incalculably into foreign debts they can never dream of liquidating.

On another level, however, this tale raises the issue of what must finally be one of the key problems in any analysis of Ousmane's work, namely the ambiguous role played in it by archaic or tribal elements. Viewers may perhaps remember the curious ending of his first film, The Black Girl, in which the European employer is inconclusively pursued by the little boy wearing an archaic mask; meanwhile such historical films as Ceddo or Emitai seem intent on evoking older moments of tribal resistance either to Islam or to the west, yet in a historical perspective which with few exceptions is that of failure and ultimate defeat. Ousmane cannot, however, be suspected of any archaizing or nostalgic cultural nationalism. Thus it becomes important to determine the significance of this appeal to older tribal values, particularly as they are more subtly active in modern works like Xala or The Money-Order.

I suspect that the deeper subject of this second novel is not so much the evident one of the denunciation of a modern national bureaucracy, but rather the historical transformation of the traditional Islamic value of alms-giving in a contemporary money economy. A Muslim has the duty to give alms-indeed, the work concludes with just such another unfulfilled request. Yet in a modern economy, this sacred duty to the poor is transformed into a frenzied assault by free-loaders from all the levels of society (at length, the cash is appropriated by a

83

westernized and affluent, influential cousin). The hero is literally picked clean by the vultures; better still, the unsought for, unexpected treasure fallen from heaven at once transforms the entire society around him into ferocious and insatiable petitioners, in something like a monetary version of Lu Xun's cannibalism.

The same double historical perspective--archaic customs radically trans­formed and denatured by the superposition of capitalist relations--seems to me demonstrable in Xala as well, in the often hilarious results of the more ancient Islamic and tribal institution of polygamy. This is what Ousmane has to say about that institution (it being understood that authorial intervention, no longer tolerable in realistic narrative, is still perfectly suitable to the allegorical fable as a form):It is worth knowing something about the life led by urban polygamists. It could be called geographical polygamy, as opposed to rural polygamy, where all the wives and children live together in the same compound. In the town, since the families a re scattered, the children have little contact with their father. Because of his way of life the father must go from house to house, villa to villa, and is only there in the evenings, at bedtime. He is therefore primarily a source of finance, when he has work. (23)Indeed, we are treated to the vivid spectacle of the Hadj's misery when, at the moment of his third marriage, which should secure his social status, he realizes he has no real home of his own and is condemned to shuttle from one wife's villa to the other, in a situation in which he suspects each of them in turn as being responsible for his ritual affliction. But the passage I have just read shows that­-whatever one would wish to think about polygamy in and of itself as an institution--it functions here as a twin-valenced element designed to open up historical perspective. The more and more frenzied trips of the Hadj through the great city secure a juxtaposition between capitalism and the older collective tribal form of social life.

These are not as yet, however, the most remarkable feature of Xala, which can be described as a stunning and controlled, virtually text-book exercise in what I have elsewhere called ""generic discontinuities.""(24) The novel begins, in effect, in one generic convention, in terms of which the Hadj is read as a comic victim. Everything goes wrong all at once, and the news of his disability suddenly triggers a greater misfortune: his numerous debtors begin to descend on someone whose bad luck clearly marks him out as a loser. A comic pity and terror accompanies this process, though it does not imply any great sympathy for the personage. Indeed it conveys a greater revulsion against the privileged new westernized society in which this rapid overturning of the wheel of fortune can take place. Yet we have all been in error, as it turns out: the wives have not been the source of the ritual

84

curse. In an abrupt generic reversal and enlargement (comparable to some of the mechanisms Freud describes in ""The Uncanny""), we suddenly learn something new and chilling about the Hadj's past:""Out story goes back a long way. It was shortly before your marriage to that woman there. Don't you remember? I was sure you would not. What I am now"" (a beggar in rags is addressing him) ""what I am now is your fault. Do you remember selling a large piece of land at Jeko belonging to our clan? After falsifying the clan names with the complicity of people in high places, you took our land from us. In spite of our protests, our proof of ownership, we lost our case in the courts. Not satisfied with taking our land you had me thrown into prison."" (25)Thus the primordial crime of capitalism is exposed: not so much wage labor as such, or the ravages of the money form, or the remorseless and impersonal rhythms of the market, but rather this primal displacement of the older forms of collective life from a land now seized and privatized. It is the oldest of modern tragedies, visited on the Native Americans yesterday, on the Palestinians today, and significantly reintroduced by Ousmane into his film version of The Money­ Order (called Mandabi), in which the protagonist is now threatened with the imminent loss of his dwelling itself.

The point I want to make about this terrible ""return of the repressed,"" is that it determines a remarkable generic transformation of the narrative: suddenly we are no longer in satire, but in ritual. The beggars and the lumpens, led by Sereen Mada himself, descend on the Hadj and require him to submit, for the removal of his xala, to an abominable ceremony of ritual humiliation and abasement. The representational space of the narrative is lifted to a new generic realm, which reaches back to touch the powers of the archaic even as it foretells the utopian destruction of the fallen present in the mode of prophecy. The word ""Brechtian,"" which inevitably springs to mind, probably does inadequate justice to these new forms which have emerged from a properly third-world reality. Yet in light of this unexpected generic ending, the preceding satiric text is itself retroactively transformed. From a satire whose subject-matter or content was the ritual curse visited on a character within the narrative, it suddenly becomes revealed as a ritual curse in its own right-the entire imagined chain of events becomes Ousmane's own curse upon his hero and people like him. No more stunning confirmation could be adduced for Robert C. Elliott's great insight into the anthropological origins of satiric discourse in real acts of shamanistic malediction.

I want to conclude with a few thoughts on why all this should be so and on the origins and status of what I have identified as the primacy of national allegory in third-world culture. We are, after all, familiar with the mechanisms of auto-

85

referentiality in contemporary western literature: is this not simply to be taken as another form of that, in a structurally distinct social and cultural context? Perhaps. But in that case our priorities must be reversed for proper understanding of this mechanism. Consider the disrepute of social allegory in our culture and the well-nigh inescapable operation of social allegory in the west's Other. These two contrasting realities are to be grasped, I think, in terms of situational conscious­-ness, an expression I prefer to the more common term materialism. Hegel's old analysis of the Master-Slave relationship (26) may still be the most effective way of dramatizing this distinction between two cultural logics. Two equals struggle each for recognition by the other: the one is willing to sacrifice life for this supreme value. The other, a heroic coward in the Brechtian, Schweykian sense of loving the body and the material world too well, gives in, in order to continue life. The Master--now the fulfillment of a baleful and inhuman feudal-aristocratic disdain for life without honor--proceeds to enjoy the benefits of his recognition by the other, now become his humble serf or slave. But at this point two distinct and dialectically ironic reversals take place: only the Master is now genuinely human, so that ""recognition"" by this henceforth sub-human form of life which is the slave evaporates at the moment of its attainment and offers no genuine satisfaction. ""The truth of the Master,"" Hegel observes grimly, ""is the Slave; while the truth of the Slave, on the other hand, is the Master."" But a second reversal is in process as well: for the slave is called upon to labor for the master and to furnish him with all the material benefits befitting his supremacy. But this means that, in the end, only the slave knows what reality and the resistance of matter really are; only the slave can attain some true materialistic consciousness of his situation, since it is precisely to that that he is condemned. The Master, however, is condemned to idealism-to the luxury of a placeless freedom in which any consciousness of his own concrete situation flees like a dream, like a word unremembered on the tip of the tongue, a nagging doubt which the puzzled mind is unable to formulate.

It strikes me that we Americans, we masters of the world, are in something of that very same position. The view from the top is epistemologically crippling, and reduces its subjects to the illusions of a host of fragmented subjectivities, to the poverty of the individual experience of isolated monads, to dying individual bodies without collective pasts or futures bereft of any possibility of grasping the social totality. This placeless individuality, this structural idealism which affords us the luxury of the Sartrean blink, offers a welcome escape from the ""nightmare of history,"" but at the same time it condemns our culture to psychologism and the ""projections"" of private subjectivity. All of this is denied to third-world culture, which must be situational and materialist despite itself. And it is this, finally, which must account for the allegorical nature of third-world culture, where the telling of the individual story and the individual experience cannot but ultimately

86

involve the whole laborious telling of the experience of the collectivity itself.

I hope I have suggested the epistemological priority of this unfamiliar kind of allegorical vision; but I must admit that old habits die hard, and that for us such unaccustomed exposure to reality, or to the collective totality, is often intolerable, leaving us in Quentin's position at the end of Absalom, Absalom!, murmuring the great denial, “Idon't hate the Third World! I don't! I don't! I don't!""

Even that resistance is instructive, however; and we may well feel, confronted with the daily reality of the other two-thirds of the globe, that ""there was nothing at all attractive about it in fact."" But we must not allow ourselves that feeling without also acknowledging its ultimate mocking completion: ""Its life was based on the principles of community interdependence.""

Besides mode-of-production theory, whose validity is in any case widely debated, there have also appeared in recent years a number of important synthesizing works on third-world history as a unified field. Three works in particular deserve mention: Global Rift, by L.S. Stavrianos (Morrow, 1981); Europe and the People without History, by Eric R. Wolf (California, 1982), and The Three Worlds, by Peter Worsley (Chicago, 1984). Such works suggest a more general methodological consequence implicit in the present essay but which should be stated explicitly here: first, that the kind of comparative work demanded by this concept of third-world literature involves comparison, not of the individual texts, which are formally and culturally very different from each other, but of the concrete situations from which such texts spring and to which they constitute distinct responses; and second, that such an approach suggests the possibility of a literary and cultural comparatism of a new type, distantly modelled on the new comparative history of Barrington Moore and exemplified in books like Theda Skocpol's States and Social Revolutions or Eric Wolf's Peasant Revolutions of the 20th Century. Such a

87

New cultural comparatism would juxtapose the study of the differences and similarities of specific literary and cultural texts with a more typological analysis of the various socio-cultural situations from which they spring, an analysis whose variables would necessarily include such features as the inter­ relationship of social classes, the role of intellectuals, the dynamics of language and writing, the configuration of traditional forms, the relationship to western influences, the development of urban experience and money, and so forth. Such comparatism, however, need not be restricted to third-world literature.

ness according to which ""mapping"" or the grasping of the social totality is structurally available to the dominated rather than the dominating classes. ""Mapping"" is a term I have used in ""Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism,"" (New Left Review #146 Uuly-August, 1984], pp. 53-92). What is here called ""national allegory"" is clearly a form of just such mapping of the totaliry, so that the present essay-which sketches a theory of the cognitive aesthetics of third-world literature-forms a pendant to the essay on postmodernism which describes the logic of the cultural imperalism of the first world and above all of the United States.

To the sound of the night
Can't tell me nothings wrong

You're the reason I am falling
You're the ground I'm drawn to heavily
Wanted more than we had, but at last I found out
There is nothing like you, there is nothing like you

This will be your last straw
I was so good to you

I don’t want to hear how you are different
I don’t want to hear how we’re the same

I've never seen someone like you
The one that I've made you into

You're everything that I need

(Addison and Naomi are sitting in the waiting room of Oceanside wellness)

Addison: I just never thought about it. What I would do, you know? What the dream would be if I couldn't have my dream.

Naomi: Empty office.

Addison: Okay, what are we doing? I thought we were going to lunch. Why are we still sitting here?

Naomi: We're doing what I do when I get depressed. Just wait. What time do you have?

Addison: It's 5 to 1:00. You know what? I'm glad I can't have a child. With my luck, I'd probably have a kid with two heads. It...it's actually better. I'm grateful. I don't have to think about it. The option is...off the table.

(Violet walks up)

Violet: What time do you have?

Naomi: 5 to 1:00.

Addison: You people are obsessed with time.

Violet: Here he comes.

(Dell walks by in only a pair of shorts with his surf board)

Naomi: Hi, Dell.

Violet: Have a nice... surf.

Dell: I'll see you guys after lunch?

Addison: You two should be ashamed of yourselves.

Naomi: Admit it. You feel better.

Violet: And if not, there's another showing in an hour, and it's wet.

(Seattle scenes)

(Jane Doe's room)

Jane Doe: My brain is bleeding? How could my brain have been bleeding since the accident?

Derek: Well, it could be from the trauma, but it also could be from one of your surgeries.

Jane Doe: Dr. Shepherd, I've been living in this hospital long enough to know when there's something one of you isn't saying.

Derek: Because of the location of the bleed, you need to be awake during surgery. You'll be sedated, alert, but, but it can be a really dangerous process. There's a lot about the brain we don't know.

Jane Doe: So... I could potentially get my memory back?

Derek: Mm. It's possible. Amnesia can be a symptom, but I think it's a long shot. I'll do some brain mapping and see if anything happens, but...

Jane Doe: But I could. get my memory back?

(Meredith enters the room where Bailey, Thatcher and Susan are)

Meredith: You're back? What happened?

Bailey: She's got a fever, and I think I hear a small murmur.

Thatcher: A heart murmur?

Susan: Don't be dramatic. At least it's not the hiccups.

Bailey: Could be complications from the endoscopy.

Meredith: Bacterial endocarditis?

Bailey: You'll have to get tests, and if they come back positive, you'll be admitted for I.V. Antibiotics.

Meredith: ...which should knock it right out.

Susan: See? I told you. Don't be dramatic.

(Alex catches up to Jane Doe who is in the hall walking)

Alex: Hey, hey. You're supposed to wait for me.

Jane Doe: I'm going crazy just sitting there.

Alex: Hey, look, I'd be freaked out, too, if somebody was about to open up my head, but Dr. Shepherd, he's the best.

Jane Doe: I can't hold my baby, right? She's...she's in that incubator. And so the nurses told me to talk to her. And I try. Guess what. Right now, I have nothing to say. You know, I don't even remember what it feels like to be outside, to have the wind in my face or rain or...I know the surgery is dangerous, but...I'm not freaked. I can't wait.

Alex: Well, there's no guarantee the surgery's gonna bring back your memory.

Jane Doe: But there's a chance. It's better than nothing.

(Sam and Violet are walking through the hall)

Sam: Good news. Uh, Paul's lack of s*x drive comes from a hormone imbalance.

Violet: So Paul still likes s*x?

Sam: Yeah, well, he's a guy and he's not dead, so I'm guessing yeah. He just...he just can't do anything about it.

Violet: And that's good news?

Sam: The bad news is that there could be many causes to this imbalance, some more serious than others. So final diagnosis and treatment could be a lengthy process. We're gonna have to run more tests.

Violet: So it might be a while before Paul can help Kathy...take the edge off.

Sam: Tell her to try swimming. It's easier on the knees.

(Addison enters Pete's office)

Addison: So...you're the quack.

Pete: Uh, I went to med school. I'm also a licensed herbalist, and I spent five years in china learning alternative medicine.

Addison: Like I said... quack.

Pete: Come here. Unless you need to go tell someone you saw goody Johnson with the devil.

Addison: Okay.

Pete: Lie down on the table.

Addison: Why?

Pete: I wanna show you that I'm not a quack.

Addison: I'm not taking my clothes off.

Pete: Did I ask you to take your clothes off? N ow...you carry a lot of tension in your shoulders and above your right eye.

Addison: What do you mean?

Pete: You're blocking some serious emotion. Hang on.

Addison: What...what are you doing?

Pete: Stop saying ""ow."" It doesn't hurt. Okay, I'm done.

Addison: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? You can't leave me here like this.

Pete: Lie there. Don't move. Breathe. You're going to experience a rush of emotion, a release of...psychic pain.

Addison: Hello? Hello? I don't feel anything...except stupid for...letting a cute hippie boy put needles in my face. Hello! Yeah, Pete...I...this isn't working. I don't have any...psychic pain. I... I'm great. Barren, but...fan-freakin'-tastic. You can come back now. I am not feeling any, you know, rush of emotion or anything. I don't feel... anything. I don't feel anything at all. I don't feel anything at all. I hate L.A.

(Derek sits on a bench outside with Meredith)

Derek: Hey.

Meredith: Hey.

Derek: I heard Susan was back. Is everything okay?

Meredith: Oh, an infection. She'll be fine.

Derek: Oh, good, 'cause I figured if anything was wrong, you'd tell me.

Meredith: If it was serious, I would, in a very ""letting you in"" sort of way. You know, it's weird.

Derek: What?

Meredith: My father...we're almost talking.

Derek: Really?

Meredith: How's the trailer?

Derek: It's freezing. Y ou want to eat later? I'll bring something over.

Meredith: Are you using me for central heating?

Derek: Among other things.

Meredith: Okay.

Derek: All right.

(Lisa and Jim enter the clinic)

Dell: Lisa?

Lisa: I think something is wrong.

Jim: She's in pain.

Addison: Lisa?

Lisa: Addison, something is not right. Oh, my god. I think I just wet my pants.

Addison: No, your water broke. She's in labor, and it's coming fast.

Naomi: I'll call an ambulance. Uh, go get Cooper.

Addison: And let the hospital know we're coming and call the chief. I don't want any problems when I try to scrub in.

(The ambulance arrives at the hospital)

Addison: Breathe

Lisa: I need to push!

Addison: Don't push. Get her into labor and delivery right away. Jim, check her in.

Carol: Lisa! Is she okay? Are they okay?

Keith: What happened? It's too early.

Rick: She's not due for another month.

Addison: Well, I'm guessing that the stress of you all fighting and crowding her, declaring yourselves the father didn't help. Move!

(Violet's office)

Violet: Any word on Lisa and the baby?

Pete: We're still waiting.

Violet: Therapy sucks.

Pete: Said the shrink.

Violet: No, I mean my particular brand of therapy might actually be...full of crap. People talking about their problems endlessly, telling people to think positively, visualize their destiny.

Pete: It doesn't work?

Violet: I think positively. I visualize my destiny. And look, just look.

Pete: What am I lookin' at?

Violet: Me...my pathetic, miserable existence. He left six months ago. He was a loser! Do you know he peed a little bit every time he coughed? Like an incontinent old woman. He smelled like pee. And there I was, in the car, crying, and I'm a serious feminist. Not to mention, my no-sex couple? Turns out it was a hormone thing. It's physical. In the old days we would've talked and talked and talked as Paul got sicker and sicker. My profession's becoming irrelevant. Maybe it's a good thing.

Pete: People should just tell the truth to the people in their lives.

Violet: They can't. If they could, we'd all be healthy.

Pete: Like me.

Violet: You're not healthy. You're in denial.

Pete: I am not in denial.

Violet: You're in denial, and you're angry. You're the angriest man I know.

Pete: Is that why you won't sleep with me?

Violet: You're in denial, you're angry, and you use s*x as weapon to deflect it.

Pete: Oh.

(Jane Doe's OR)

Derek: Now stimulating area 11.

Alex: Ava, can you name this object?

Jane Doe: Flowers, pink and blue.

Derek: Avoiding area 11. Moving superiorly. This will be area 12.

Jane Doe: Una cara con los ojos azules y el pelo rubio.

Alex: Was that Spanish?

Jane Doe: Was it?

Derek: Okay, I'm going on to 13.

Jane Doe: Il maison avec des galets rouge.

Alex: All right. Now you're just showing off.

Derek: Each language is stored in a different area of the brain. And as I stimulate them...this will be 14.

Alex: So this isn't from the surgery? She actually speaks Spanish and French?

Jane Doe: Alex...das ist noch das haus.

Alex: And German?

Derek: She's hypoventilating. Let's put her under and work on the bleed.

Alex: Can't we keep going just a few more minutes? Maybe she can get her memory back along with the languages.

Derek: If we don't control this bleed, she'll lose a lot more than her memory. She'll die.

(Lisa's OR)

Lisa: Why is this happening so fast?

Nurse: Uh, doctors?

Addison: Cooper, she's crowning.

Cooper: All right, just don't push, Lisa.

Lisa: Oh, push? Okay.

Addison: No! No, don't push, Lisa. The cord's wrapped around the baby's neck.

Lisa: Oh, I'm sorry! I can't help it! God! Oh!

Cooper: I'll hold her. You clamp and cut.

Addison: Okay.

Cooper: Is she okay?

Addison: Hang 20 of oxytocin. 8 French suction catheter.

Lisa: Why isn't she crying?

Addison: Dr. Freedman's gonna be working on her. We need to focus on your right now, Lisa. Fortunately, you're not bleeding that much, so we should be able to remove the placenta by...

Lisa: By...by what? By what?

Addison: Put her under, now.

Cooper: What's going on?

Addison: Her uterus must have ruptured because of the placenta accreta. We have to open her up.

Lisa: No, no, no, no, no. The baby's not crying.

Nurse: B.P.'S 58 over 32.

Lisa: Don't put me under till the baby cries.

Addison: We don't have time, Lisa. We have to put you under right now.

Cooper: Go, Addison.

Lisa: Okay.

Addison: Hang two units of b-positive and make sure we have plenty on standby. She's gonna exsanguinate if we don't move quickly,people.10-blade .

(Addison goes outside to where the others are waiting)

Addison: Lisa lost a lot of blood, we had to put the baby on oxygen, but they are both stable.

Doug: Who's the father?

Jim: What?

Rick: You said you sent off for the paternity test. Which one of us is the father?

Carol: Did Lisa say anything, her decision about the baby?

Addison: Lisa lost a lot of blood, we had to put the baby on oxygen, but they are both stable. I say it again

because it seems like you didn't hear me the first time. They almost died. Lisa almost died. And so I didn't have time, what, with, um, trying to save her life, to pause and check on the paternity test or ask her about the baby's future. What is wrong with you people?

Carol: Can...can we see the baby?

Addison: No. None of you go near Lisa or the baby until I say so. The child is not a possession that you fight over. And by the way, not that you asked, it's a girl...6 pounds, 9 ounces.

(Jane Doe's room)

Jane Doe: I don't remember.

Alex: Hey. We got it, the bleed. You're gonna be fine. By the way, uh, you rocked that surgery. You spoke three languages.

Jane Doe: I don't remember anything.

Alex: The surgery was sup...

Jane Doe: I th...thought I would...what am I gonna do? What if... what if I never remember anything?

(The clinic, George is laying on a gurney)

Bailey: You sick, O'Malley? You feel fine. Take an aspirin and get off my clean bed.

George: You been married a long time, right?

Bailey: O'Malley, I do not have time to answer...

George: Did you have doubts...about your marriage? I don't mean, uh, insecurities. I mean really serious doubts.

Nurse: Dr. Bailey, I need you to sign this before I can discharge bed ten.

Bailey: No. He's supposed to get an I.V. Dose before discharge. Why don't people listen?

(Susan's room)

Susan: Someday you'll have to explain to me how antibiotics actually work. They are miraculous.

Richard: Good afternoon. Uh, Dr. Bailey asked me to look in. Everything looks good. We are going to take you to radiology to get a central line to continue your I.V. Antibiotics outpatient.

Susan: Okay. Hey, will you show your dad the cafeteria?

Meredith: Sure. We're on to you, you know?

Susan: What?

(The clinic, Burke is hiding behind a curtain)

Burke: Dr. Bailey. I was...looking for some privacy, and, uh, I didn't think anyone would come looking for me down here. I apologize.

Bailey: No problem. Take your time.

Burke: Uh, Dr. Bailey.

Bailey: Yeah.

Burke: Um, you've been married a long time now, right? Do you think it matters if one person...is...is more ready?

Bailey: O'Malley!

George: Yeah.

Bailey: Come here.

George: Yes. Hi, Dr. Burke.

Bailey: I want the two of you to talk to each other. I want you to talk to each other and leave my marriage out of it. I also want you to leave my clinic out of it. And by that, I mean get out. I need the space, I need the peace,

I need the quiet, and I need it now.

George: Sorry.

Burke: Yeah, right, sorry.

(The kitchen at Oceanside wellness)

Violet: Cooper, you're blocking the caffeine.

Naomi: He's blocking the caffeine.

Violet: Cooper, if you move, I'll give you a cookie.

Naomi: Hey, did something go wrong with Lisa's surgery?

Cooper: No, uh, we handled it. Addison...she is, pretty excellent. She's pretty excellent.

Violet: Okay, only because you've sighed twice...what's the matter, Cooper?

Cooper: I don't go to hookers. I don't go to strip clubs. I meet women on the internet that want to meet me.

So I like 'em a little younger and a little dirtier. Is that wrong? It's wrong?

Naomi: You need to meet a grown-up. You need to date someone your own age.

Violet: Someone without a porny internet name and...and perhaps no criminal past.

Naomi: A nice girl.

Violet: A viable girl.

Naomi: Someone with whom you can have a relationship.

Violet: You're a respected doctor.

Naomi: Go out in the real world, meet a woman your own age and ask her out.

Violet: Be a man, cooper. Be a man.

Pete: There you are. I just stopped by to see how Lisa and the baby are doing. You okay?

Addison: Yeah. I just...I...I had a little too much surgery today. But I'm...I'm good.

Pete: You look good. You look... beautiful. Sam told me that I had to stay away from you because you're Naomi's friend, but...

Addison: Stop it.

Pete: What?

Addison: You're flirting.

Pete: What's wrong with flirting?

Addison: What's wrong with it? What's wrong? What's wrong is that I don't have time for it. I am... out of time. I missed my chance. And now I have two eggs left. I might as well have no eggs left. I am egg-less. Naomi says that she's dried up? I'm the one who's dried up. I'm all barren and dried up. And I have clearly been wasting my time on men. I mean, I might as well take up hobbies, like needlepoint or, um, collecting those little ceramic dolls, you know? Because that's what dried up women do. They do needlepoint. They do not waste their time flirting with men who clearly just want to get laid. They do not waste their time...telling overly personal...information about their eggs to total strangers. Oh, my god. I'm sorry. What are you doing?

Pete: I'm gonna kiss you. I'm gonna kiss you with tongue. I'm gonna kiss you so you feel it. Okay?

Addison: Okay. (They kiss) Why'd you do that?

Pete: To remind you...that you're not dried up. If you need me to remind you again...let me know.

Addison: Okay.

(Susan's room)

Meredith: When did the cramping start?

Susan: A little while ago.

Thatcher: What is it? Is it...

Meredith: Probably nothing serious. It could just be a reaction to the antibiotics. We may have to switch to another one, but it may mean another night here.

Susan: It's okay, it's okay.

Meredith: It's okay.

(Addison walks into a hallway where Carol is)

Carol: Wait. I know...I know that you think we're awful, and I think that we're awful. I just, um...I just wanted a baby so badly. I just wanted a baby. And I don't care who the father is, I don't care if the baby's mine. All that matters is the baby. Is...is she gonna be okay? Just tell me that she's gonna be okay.

Addison: She's gonna be okay.

Carol: Thank you.

Addison: You're welcome.

(George and Burke are in the hallway)

Burke: I hear Callie's going to be a bridesmaid.

George: Yeah.

Burke: Would you, um, say that you were the one that needed more urging to get married?

George: Oh, I hadn't...really been thinking about it. I...it just, uh, seemed like a good idea at the time. You and Cristina have been together for a while.

Burke: You got married pretty fast.

George: So in theory it's better to know someone pretty well. Way better than...

Burke: Still, no guarantees.

George: I...I don't...believe in divorce.

Burke: Neither do I.

George: Is it possible...do you think, to love two people...at the same time?

Burke: I, uh...I'm still hoping it's possible just to love one person.

(Callie walks up to Izzie in the hall)

Callie: Hey. So, uh, it's not gonna be too weird, right? Me as a bridesmaid?

Izzie: No, no, it's fine.

Callie: Cause I can tell Cristina...

Izzie: I said it's fine. Really, no worries.

Callie: So, um...did George tell you he's thinking about transferring to mercy west?

Izzie: Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.

Callie: So we're fine?

Izzie: Oh, we are. Fine.

(Izzie leaves and Cristina walks up)

Cristina: Hey, that last dress was ok, wasn't it? I mean, it was too tight and I couldn't breathe, but...a wedding's just one day, right?

Callie: Yeah.

Cristina: Yeah.

(Sam's office)

Sam: We got Paul's M.R.I. back, and I've consulted with Dr. Straley at Sloan-Kettering. We found a tumor on your adrenal gland. All right? It sits right on top of the kidney, and it's what's been causing your low s*x drive.

Kathy: So it wasn't me? He's got a condition. A...a tumor, that's not too...You can treat that, right?

Sam: These tumors are usually aggressive and found late because the symptoms are so subtle.

Paul: What is that mean?

Sam: Treatment is difficult and risky, but there is hope.

Kathy: Oh, my god, honey, I can't believe I yelled at you. I'm so sorry.

Paul: It's all right, honey. It's okay.

Kathy: No, I'm horrible. I'm so sorry. I love you so much.

(Addison is talking to the elevator again)

Addison: Hello? Hello? Are you there...Elevator god? It's me, Addison.

Voice: What?

Addison: Hi.

Voice: Hi.

Addison: Okay, look, you may be a figment of my imagination, or maybe I'm going completely insane, I don't know. Or maybe...this is payback for my crimes on some ginormous karmic level, I don't know. I just...I just want to tell you I'm sorry for yelling at you. Okay?

Voice: Okay.

Addison: Well...Bye.

(Kathy and Violet are alone in her office)

Kathy: I am such a screw-up...In my life. Up until now, I have been really great at one thing. I am great...at being Paul's wife. And I thought he didn't want me anymore. I thought...I was sure that he was in love with somebody else.

Violet: Of course you were.

Kathy: I lied to Paul. I was with a man that night that I didn't come home. I didn't even find him that attractive.

I just told myself that I wasn't gonna settle for being alone, you know?

Violet: Kathy, you were reacting to what was in front of you. There was no way you could know what was really going on.

Kathy: What do I do now?

Violet: You do what you're great at. You love your husband.

Kathy: You're gonna have to tell me that a lot, okay?

Violet: Okay.

(Dell enters Naomi's office)

Dell: Hey, everyone else is gone. I was heading out. Uh, unless...I was gonna get some food. You want something?

Naomi: Oh...No. I...I ate. Thanks for asking.

Dell: Another night?

Naomi: Dell, are you...

Dell: Asking you out on a date? Yes.

Naomi: You can't ask me out.

Dell: Yes, I can.

Naomi: No, you can't.

Dell: I asked.

Naomi: You're...you're a fetus. You could be my fetus.

Dell: Coo coo cachoo, Mrs. Robinson.

Naomi: You can't use ""the graduate"" as a defense. You can't use a movie made before you were born as a defense.

Dell: Go out with me. I like you, and you like me.

Naomi: Dell.

Dell: Yeah.

Naomi: Never gonna happen.

(Addison is at a bar with the other doctors)

Addison: I'm starting to think L.A. is like New York, but with a beach.

Pete: Why do you think we moved here?

Sam: Uh, Pete. Uh, isn't it time for you to get some refills?

Pete: Thanks.

Sam: Thanks, buddy.

Sam: Okay, Pete is my friend, don't get me wrong, but...

Addison: Why are you warning me about him? What, is he like a serial killer? Is he a felon? Is he secretly my ex-husband's best friend?

Sam: His wife died eight years ago.

Addison: Now I feel shallow.

Sam: No, it's just...He can't connect with women. He's a good man, but if you want someone who's gonna be there, then Pete's not that guy.

(Violet and Cooper are at the bar)

Cooper: This is nice, huh?

Violet: It is.

Cooper: Yeah.

(He leans in for a kiss)

Violet: No, no. Oh, no.

Cooper: What?

Violet: That's not nice.

Cooper: Oh, you s...Hold it, hold it, hold on. You said, ""be a man.""

Violet: Oh, Cooper, I commend you. You're making an effort. But I'm...I'm...but I'm your friend. You can't be a man with your friend. Isn't that settling?

Cooper: Kinda, yeah. Yes.

Violet: Okay.

Cooper: Settling.

Violet: Great.

Cooper: Thank you, yes.

Violet: But we're good?

Cooper: We're very good.

Violet: Okay.

(Naomi walks over to Addison and Sam)

Naomi: Hey, ex-best friend. Hey, ex-husband.

Addison: You are drunk.

Naomi: Ten more minutes, and I start dancing, and I require company.

Sam: I don't think I've ever seen her drunk before.

Addison: Sam...Did you cheat on her?

Sam: Over the years, there have been temptations, but, no...I didn't.

Addison: Was there a lot of fighting or...

Sam: Hardly ever. Honestly...It was bad, what I did. I have no good reason. I woke up one day...And I couldn't do it anymore. It wasn't even a choice. I had a thought...Next thing you know...I'm burning it all down. I left her.

I don't know why. I don't know why. What kind of a person does that?

Addison: Hell if I know. And I did it, too.

(At the bar)

Violet: So I ran into Allan...At whole foods. Wanna hear something funny? He said he didn't believe in marriage, that marriage wasn't for him. But I guess that was wrong, because it only took him four months.

Four months after we broke up, he got married, to someone who can't be more than 25 years old. Isn't that funny?

Cooper: It heads off rejection.

Violet: What?

Cooper: That's why I like the internet. I can't stand the...It's horrible, being rejected.

Violet: It is.

(Preston enters his apartment where is mom is)

Jane: Preston, I thought you had a late surgery.

Burke: You know all that...""I trust you"" crap? You've been pulling that on me since I was this high.

Jane: Preston, language.

Burke: No. ""I trust you"" is code for ""learn from your mistakes."" This is not a mistake.

Jane: I never said it was a mistake.

Burke: Cristina never knows what's good for her. That's who she is.

Jane: Preston...

Burke: She hates change. I lead. I have to. And then she's grateful. That's how it was with dating, with moving in. Then I'm pleased for you. Look, I am going to make her happy, mama. The wedding is a huge step, and she's being a great sport. You know why? Because she will be happy someday.

Jane: If you are so sure...Why are you yelling at me?



(Susan's room)

Meredith: What happened?

Richard: She's septic. The sooner we can get her to an OR, the sooner we can help her. Let's move. Move.

Thatcher: Richard, what...what happened?

Richard: Extremely rare complication. Toxic mega colon with a perforation. Can you get your dad out of this room, please?

Thatcher: This fast? How could...

Richard: Sometimes it progresses this rapidly. Very rarely, but sometimes. We booked an O.R.

Thatcher: You're going into surgery right now? I...I didn't sign a consent form.

Richard: She needs surgery right now, Thatcher. Not tomorrow, not later today. Right now.

Susan: Thatcher...

Thatcher: Honey, listen...

Meredith: We need you to stay back, okay?

(Outside the OR)

Meredith: You're gonna be okay. This happens. You're gonna be okay. We're losing her pulse she's coding. Richard: Okay, let's go. Let's move. Move.

(Lisa's room)

Lisa: She's okay, huh? I mean, after all she went through, she still looks pretty awesome.

Cooper: Lisa, we need to know what you want to do with the baby.

Lisa: Carol...she wants this so bad.

Naomi: This is about what you want. We did find out the paternity.

Lisa: No, no. I don't wanna know. She's awesome, though.

Addison: You don't have to decide right now.

Lisa: No. I know what I want to do.

(Carol and the others are in the nursery while the doctors watch from outside)

Pete: Lisa gave the baby to Carol.

Cooper: On the condition they'd all be part of her life.

Sam: So it turns out the baby will have three dads anyway.

Naomi: And two moms.

Violet: Lisa did a good thing. They look happy.

Naomi: They look like a family.

(Izzie is in the elevator with George)

George: Izzie, look...

Izzie: Look, I don't want you to go. To Mercy West...I don't want you...It's not fair. I know we can't help what happened, and I know that we didn't...I stood in that bridal shop with your wife, and I smiled and I talked, and I felt like...It's not fair. I don't want you to go to Mercy West because I'm losing my best friend, and it's not fair.

It's just not fair.

(They hug and then begin kissing)

George: We can't.

Izzie: I know.

(The elevator doors open and Callie is outside them)

Callie: Hey. I was looking for you. You ready to go?

(Alex is taking Jane Doe for a walk outside)

Alex: A lot of folks would kill for what you have, you know? A clean slate. So you don't remember? So what?

You'll make new memories. Oh, wow. Look at that. It's so beautiful.

Jane Doe: How can you be so...You're so good with me. What's wrong with you that you can't be this good with someone you have feelings for? What happened to you, Alex?

Alex: Maybe I don't remember. So what?

(Meredith, Richard and Bailey walks into the hall where Thatcher is. Derek is also nearby)

Meredith: We...we did everything...we could.

Thatcher: You...you said it was really simple and that it was this...small thing.

Meredith: It was.

(Thatcher suddenly slaps Meredith in the face)

Thatcher: She had the hiccups. She came here...Because...because she trusted you. I trusted you.

(Meredith runs off)

Derek: Meredith, just stop...okay, just stop.

Meredith: No, don't. Don't.

MVO: At some point, maybe we accept that the dream has become a nightmare.

Thatcher: She had the hiccups. Oh, god. The hiccups.

(Burke and Cristina are finally alone)

Burke: They've left. It's just us.

Cristina: Oh, thank god. Ohh. I got a dress.

Burke: Yeah? You happy?

Cristina: Yeah. Are you...happy?

Burke: Yeah.

MVO: We tell ourselves the reality is better.

(Meredith, Alex and Izzie are at the house)

Alex: Limes!

Meredith: Limes.

Izzie: Limes.

Alex: So what are we drinking to this time?

Izzie: Friends. Crappy friends.

Meredith: Family. Crappy family.

Alex: Again?

Meredith: Again.

Izzie: Again.

Meredith: Who wants another?

(Derek is outside and once again is left alone)

MVO: We convince ourselves it's better that we never dream at all. But the strongest of us, the most determined of us, we hold on to the dream.

(Addison is preparing to leave LA)

Naomi: You're ugly and old.

Addison: I'll miss you, too. Okay.

Naomi: There is an empty office.

Addison: Don't tempt me.

Naomi: Think about it.

(Addison enters the elevator)

MVO: Or we find ourselves faced with a fresh dream we never considered.

Pete: Hold the door.

MVO: We awake to find ourselves...Against all odds...Feeling hopeful.

Addison: This is gonna sound...when no one else is around, the elevator kind of, uh...Talks to me.

Pete: Hi, Tilly.

Tilly: Hey, Pete.

Pete: That's Tilly. She works security. The camera is right there.

Addison: Oh. Hello, Tilly.

Tilly: Hey, I get my kicks wherever I can.

Pete: You goin' home?

Addison: Yeah...Home.

Pete: You get what you came for?

Addison: I honestly...don't know.

Pete: Do you want me to kiss you again?

Addison: I think...not.

Pete: Because of the elevators where you come from? Those horny, aphrodisiac elevators?

Addison: Yeah, that, and, um...I'm not interested, so...

Pete: Oh. You're interested.

(Pete gets out of the elevator and slowly Addison does too. Addison drives her car back to Seattle.)

MVO: And if we're lucky, we realize...In the face of everything, in the face of life...The true dream...Is being able to dream at all.

Never kisses, all you ever send are fullstops (La la la la)

53,25066,Lost,Gareth Emery,"[Verse 1]
And there's no smoke without reason
It's a sign there's something wrong
In my lungs there's a poison
I've been breathing in too long
'Cause there's no I
No I in We
And there's no You
No You in Me
'Cause I've been burned
Way beyond the third degree

[Chorus]
'Cause your words are like gasoline
You pour on the fire
And the bridges you burned
Led to our dreams
It's just another thing that we lost
When the spark turned into a flame
And the flames grew much higher
And my hope, faith, and every last desire
Is just another thing that we lost in the fire

Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost

[Verse 2]
Ashes fall just like snowflakes
That are warm against my skin
You say that we could re-build this
Wouldn't know where to begin
'Cause there's no snow
And there's no rain
To hide my tears
To douse these flames
'Cause I've been burned
Way beyond the third degree

[Chorus]
'Cause your words are like gasoline
You pour on the fire
And the bridges you burn
Led to our dreams
It's just another thing that we lost
When the spark turned into a flame
And the flames grew much higher
And my hope, faith, and every last desire
Is just another thing that we lost in the fire
Is just another thing that we lost in the fire
Is just another thing that we lost in the fire

Is just another thing that we lost in the fire
Is just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost
Just another thing that we lost

Never enough
You will always find those days when it's rough
But you need to feel existent
Keep it real and be persistent

No one can win
If you wake up tryna get out of your skin
You're the one you have to live with
Slow it down, don't overthink it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There are people that won't accept a ""no"" from you
There are those who won't see you as a person just success
Don't give in, if you feel that it's not right for you
Don't you do it, oh

[Chorus]
It's tough to play the part in somebody's show
A no is always no, don't try to convince me
It's hard to face the world when words are left unheard
Wake me when it's quiet
Wake me when it's quiet

[Post-Chorus]
On a better day, come wake me up
On a better day, come wake me up
On a better day, come wake me up
Wake me when it's quiet

Pushing the edge (pushing the edge)
Just to give your crowd a smile on their face
There are levels of emotions
Just don't let it get you over

There are people that will accept a ""no"" from you
There are thousands who'll see you as a person, not success
Don't give in, if you feel that it's not right for you
Don't you do it, no

[Chorus]
It's tough to play the part in somebody's show
A no is always no, don't try to convince me
It's hard to face the world when words are left unheard
Wake me when it's quiet
Wake me when it's quiet

On a better day, come wake me up
On a better day, come wake me up
On a better day, come wake me up
Wake me when it's quiet

Woke up late, didn't care
That day the world was mine to take
Wide open
New shoes, clean slate
Feeling great
No one could get in my way
Unshaken In that time
Your smile drew mine
I could feel your eyes
See inside my heart
You and me, meant to be
The day was ours for us to share

[Chorus]
Can you bring me back to that day, that day
Endless nights we felt forever
Slip away
Can you bring me back hit replay, replay
Can you bring me back
Can you bring me back
Can you bring me back to that day, that day
Endless nights we felt forever
Slip away
Can you bring me back hit replay, replay
Can you bring me back (x10)

I'm a casualty of this emotional war
Can't break the chains but I'm the one to blame
Give it all to keep you right here, right here with me

You got a lock on my love
I'm a prisoner
For you I surrender

I surrender

I can't ignore what fate has for us
Can run but can't hide, no getting away from love
My hands are tied and I'm bound to this feeling
Keeps calling me and I must give in

And I can't escape
You got a lock on my love

For you I surrender

Running round in circles with no place to call home?
Sip another drink so you can hold on, hold tight
Hoping that you'll find a little piece of daylight

Go light your spark, set fire to the dark
You'll see that all the shadows lie behind you
Go make your mark, it ends where you start
The night is new

There's a light in every hollow where the sun comes shining through
It'll find you down the river when you are left black and blue
There's a light in every hollow, like the world you never knew
There's a place where days are golden, right here, waiting for you

There's a light, there's a light, there's a light in every hollow. (x4)

Can you find the beauty in the broken pieces?
Stitch 'em back together, and I swear you'll see it
Blowing up in smoke, it's like you're barely breathing
Every breath you take, just know your heart's still beating

Go light your spark, set fire to the dark
You'll see that all the shadows lie behind you
Go make your mark, it ends where you start
The night is new

There's a light in every hollow where the sun comes shining through
It'll find you down the river when you are left black and blue

Triplo 0 - 4 5 sono il top, let's go!
Accanna col Critical Flow
Qua finisce come a Roma - Feyenoord
21 dietro le spalle come Paulo
Sono il serpente, tu sei il ratto
Vieni mangiato un dato di fatto, che misfatto
Mi sono fatto da solo e fatto con qualcun'altro
Sai qual è il fatto? Non vieni dal disagio
Se papi col BMW ti porto a spasso
Puoi esse' forte quanto voi' ma poi decide l'arbitro
Manco mi agito, so che non sei del mio calibro
Fumo nero Kalidou, prendo il carico e sto gonfio Majin Bu
Non trovo il tuo nome su ìTunes
Vuoi fa' l'attrezzato ma non hai i tools
Nella cup non ho syrup, non dico cazzate come fai tu
Hai 5k in un borsone, finti come ste persone
Non ho buone nuove, la mia vita è una prigionе
Meglio che non fai rap, cicho mettitе a pia' er Sole
Torna a fa' le sole che n'sei bono a scrive' strofe
Rapper oggi hai le tue cose
Sei una fichetta torna in depressione, non fare il coglione
Ti sorpasso in curva Casey Stoner
Sto dovunque come un piccione, 5 lettere una religione
Sono la tua ossessione
Ho fame mangio carne di scamone e di infamone
Mi scrivono troie, tu' moglie
Vogliono il mio pesce salmone
Lo mangiano e diventano ciccione, Talev

[Verso 2: Keyonz]
Cazzo vuoi da me se non sai fare rap?
Resto a casa ad allenarmi poi finisco
E dopo liscio in disco, mischio coca e Jack
Solo paranoie nel mio backpack
Hai la faccia triste mentre aspetti il turno a Black Jack
Sai che stai perdendo tutto fai pena più di uno skinner
Per battermi non ti basta fumare gomma e fare tag
Devi fare di più, basta con le seghe e le serie tv
Ma se tipo provi a farti qualche doccia in più
Con quei capelli sporchi scemo sembri Piero Pelù
Non posso, fra’ non ti sopporto, fra’ ti vorrei morto
Ma poi chiudo un occhio
Al tuo funerale ballo il tango sul corpo
E non lo faccio perché voglio ma perché posso
Sei, sei solamente un cazzone vestito Prada
Ti ho visto accappottato dopo 2 tiri di zaza
Il beat della Savana, sono il re come Mufasa
Hai preso un’altra volta schiaffi frate torna a casa vai (vai)
Torna a casa dai (vai)

Turns her back to a path, where she was forced to run away

108,25147,Looking Back,The Only,"I said we don't belong together
That we would only get in our way
I said it couldn't last forever
(And ever)
That it would hurt more if I stayed
(I should have stayed away)

I tried to run from you
Feels like I'm running on a track
I keep on looking back
I keep on looking back

Why, oh why
do I say cruel words and never take them back
when you take me back?

Why, oh why
do I fight so hard to push you far away
when I want you to stay?
I should've just stayed away
Stayed away
I should've just stayed away
Stayed away

Why, oh why
do I try so hard to throw it all away?
I tried to run from you
But I was running on a track
I keep on looking back
I keep on looking back

I keep on looking back

Swallow the paper soldiers
Get out of the way, sway
Sway, sway

You and me caught up in the sway, sway
Open fire on the system

These machines try to push us
Back but we won't move
Victory for the dreamers
Nothing left to prove

Standing our ground out in the rain

Swallow the paper soldiers
Get out of the way, sway

112,25145,Sovereign Light Café,Keane,"[Verse 1]
I'm going back to a time when we owned this town
Down Powder Mill Lane, in the battlegrounds
We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns
I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
When we talked about things we were gonna do
We were wide eyed dreamers and wiser too

[Chorus 1]
We'd go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

[Verse 2]
I'm begging you for some sign
But you've still got nothing to say
Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
I'm a better man now than I was that day

[Chorus 2]
Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
To take turns, just as the stars of the Sovereign Light Café

[Bridge]
I wheel my bike off the train
Up the North Trade Road
And look for you in Marley Lane
In every building, every street sign
Oh why did we ever go so far from home?

[Verse 3]
Well you've got nothing to hide
You can't change who you really are
You can get a big house and a faster car
You can run away boy, but you won't go far

[Chorus 2]
Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
Watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier

130,25190,Walking Dead,Rebeat,"I feel it

Consume me

Still breathing

But losing

No escaping

Your haunting love

Don't tell me its over

I know we're not done, I feel you near

Cause further is closer

You say that you're gone I know you're here

Cause I'm still drowning in shadows of you

And I can touch you with every move

No its not over

I'm living with the ghost of all you left

Walking dead

I'm broken

Collapsing

Still burning

From your poison

You stay with me

Baby cut me deep

I'm slowly dying clinging to all the memories

Don't tell me its over

I know we're not done, I feel you near

Cause further is closer

You say that you're gone I know you're here

Cause I'm still drowning in shadows of you

And I can touch you with every move

No its not over

I'm living with the ghost of all you left

Walking dead

131,25167,Limitless,BURNS,"I saw myself in your star
Magnetism shields my heart
I feel your voice calling me, me, me, me
I am mortal, ill concealed
My foundation is revealed
I hear your name calling me, me, me, me

In the darkness you're my leader
Put my hands up, I reach for heaven
Our love is limitless
We are limitless
Our love is limitless
We are limitless

As our trembling hands are tied
Our prime evil spirits lie
I hear your life calling me, me, me, me
I am written in the stone
All the whites are painted gold
I hear your heart calling me, me, me, me

Our love is limitless
We are limitless
Our love is limitless
We are limitless
Our love is limitless
Our love is limitless

In the darkness you're my leader
Put my hands up, I reach for heaven
Our love is limitless
We are limitless
Our love is limitless
We are limitless

132,25151,I Don’t Like You,Eva Simons,"[Verse 1]
Fade to the darkness all the way
At the start guess I hoped
That for once I had escaped the fakes, the snakes
Waste of time, so face to face
I'll be bold enough to throw
All there is I belong to say, to say, to say

[Pre-Chorus]
That this is all but dissolved
It's dead and ended now
I left all the reasons why
Why you should still be here, go

[Link]
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, like you
I'm not like you
You ain't what I want
And time will never work this out

[Chorus]
Oh no, I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
Oh no, I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you

[Drop]
I don't like you
All the way

Sane, not confused
Clear in the brain
It's a losing hand, fold
Why play on nothing to gain?
Pull on the reigns

That this is all but dissolved
It's dead and ended now
I left all the reasons why
Why you should still be here, go

Oh no, I've gone cold

I don't even like you now, forget you
Oh no, I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you

[Drop]
I don't like you
All the way

Done with right
I just don't feel this, I'm not all over, it's there
Through with trying, that's what the real is
This love has taken its last breath

Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, like you
I'm not like you
You ain't what I want
And time will never work this out

133,25168,Starting Again,East & Young,"The sun spread across the land
And now with broken hands
We're sifting through the sand

But it's blowing out of control
Too fast, we let it burn too fierce to last
The twisting wheels of melting glass
Even after all that's passed
I can feel it starting again

Like cars cutting through the night
We never looked twice
At what we left behind
Just kept our eyes on the lines
Stretched off into the dark
So we never asked
If this could ever stop

Burning out of control too fast
We let it burn to fierce to last
The twisting wheels of broken glass
Even after all that's passed
I can feel it starting again

I can feel it starting again
I can feel it starting again
I can feel it starting again
I can feel it starting again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again

I don't know what we've started
But I'll tell you how it ends
We'll be walking through the sunset
As we feel, it's starting over again

No, I don't know what we started
But I'll tell you how it ends
We'll be walking through the sunset
As we feel, it's starting over again
Again

As we feel, it's starting over again
Again

As we feel, it's starting over again
Again

If these ashes came from flames
And if we re-light these embers
Would they just burn out again?
We can try, we should try

Just like we did when we were younger
Someday I know we’re gonna beat again, gonna beat again
Like a drum, like a drum

Thinking over all the things you said to me, you said to me…

Pretty soon there'll be nowhere left to run away, to run away…

You packed your bags to leave by the morning
Destination far off and foreign

Take a souvenir to remind me of the ones I love…

Running out of time with each tick tock

146,25185,U,Gareth Emery,"Walking down the highway, traffic's coming my way
All I see is flashing light
People wearing blue suits want to know the real truth:
How many did I have tonight?
Looking at the wreckage anyone would guess that all inside had died
But I'm alive

Wake up in a strange bed, angels over my head
One of them is shouting ""clear""
Thousand bolts of lightning bring me back to life
And it's a miracle that I'm still here
As I'm coming to, I'm screaming out for you
I need you by my side
And I'm alive

[Chorus]
No I didn't pray to God
No I never saw the light
No I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
I just closed my eyes and all I saw was you

No I didn't pray to God
No I never saw the light
No I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
I just closed my eyes and all I saw was you

A long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I broke 'til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool who just shot off a gun
Heart still beating, but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reached out trying to love, but I feel nothing
Oh, my heart is numb

[Pre-Chorus]
But with you I feel again
Yeah, with you I can feel again
But with you (I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I feel again (I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)
Yeah, with you (I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I can feel again (I was a lonely soul)

A little bit of misfit banter
A little bit of jojo dancing
A little bit of thoughts of mine coming out the mind of this midnight rambler

[Verse 1]
I can't wait til these tunes of mine get me out of this local jam
Get up up on that big stage now
Show the world just who the heck I am
Ever think if it all goes right
You got something that could change your life
Use that moment just to show your life
Everything is gonna be alright....

[Pre-Chorus]
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They say if you look around for something hard enough and you just might find it
And there's some around who wanna keep you down but Shawty don't be blinded
Feeling trapped, thinking that you can't get out of this humdrum scene
Time to turn this thing upside down
Show these people what you really mean
Everything that you could lose your mind
Could it be the big dream you'll find
No more waiting cuz it's almost time
Everything is gonna be alright....

[Pre-Chorus]
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

Hope I feel this forever
Or even if it's just tonight
I can see the end much clearer
Even when I close my eyes
Tryna keep myself from falling
Tryna get this thing right
I gotta do this more often
Well, well maybe tonight

Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide

Give me just one reason
Why we've seen enough
We're not even close
So come on, and wake up

Out apart
This will never change
The sun shines
In space tonight
This will stay the same

When the moon breaks up
And the sun runs out
Will I ever wake up
To the morning light
Turn me on inside
Will I fade into the night

When it all falls down
When it all falls down, Yeah

The lights are down
Im fading out
Never felt the same
Im coming home
I feel the storm
Raging over me

When the moon breaks up
And the sun runs out
Will I ever wake up
To the morning light
Turn me on inside
Will I fade into the night

When it all falls down
When it all falls down, Yeah

180,25222,Never Let You Go,Dash Berlin,"We were living a lie and looking away
Floating inside some outer space
Hurting ourselves and losing control
We were so far gone
But then underneath it all, underneath it all
There's something beautiful like a fallen star
You show me not to let, show me not to let, let it go

All over again, time after time
I never believed it could be mine
A flash in the dark, when nothing was right
When I'm with you I feel alive

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

We're splitting the sky with fire in our hearts
And nothing can stop us leaving the past
They try pulling us back and tying us down
We're too far gone
Way up above it all, up above it all were
Something beautiful and it's all because you
Show me not to let, show me not to let, let it go

All over again, time after time
I never believed it could be mine
A flash in the dark, when nothing was right
When I'm with you feel alive

As she says her goodbyes
She's close to sacrifice
She knows something ain't right

And it ain't pleasing
She's just tryna find a way out there
She put our faith in
You know it's chasing
She's just tryna find her love out there
And she cries

[Hook 1: Olaf Blackwood]
I need you, hm
Like the wave needs an ocean
Like the love needs devotion
I need you
Like the desert pleads for water
Like a mission needs a martyr
I need you
Every minute, every hour
I lay broken like a flower
'Cause I need you, I need you

All these echoes bouncing off the sky
When she takes me down abandoned streets

As the demon plays his violin
A string of sound repeats from deep within
I can feel the space embracing me
I'm Hollow

When darkness fall asleep
Steal my heart away from me
And hold me while you rip my soul apart
Yeah

I'm hollow
I'm hollow

When darkness fall asleep
Steal my heart away from me
And hold me while you rip my soul apart
Yeah

I'm hollow

It was like a whirlwind, scattered us like leaves
But I'm stuck inside a feeling, a song that never leaves
We were like a symphony

Gravity pulls me in time
I love you when you
Make me feel alive
You lift me completely
Waiting for all of the life
So feel the moment
Turn off ur mind
Your night is like the stars in the sky because
We belong right here

I don't want anyone else
I don't want anyone else to be in your heart
Anyone else
I don't want anyone else

I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself

I know that when nobody is alive
Strong enough to break me sometimes
Wings to make phoenix to fly
Lift me up completely
Waiting for you all of my life
So feel the moment turn up
& the night is like the stars in the sky
Cauce we belong right here

I don't want anyone else
I don't want anyone else to be in ur heart
Anyone else

S’enfoncer dans le silence
Plus rien ne viendra troubler
Le miroir de notre été

[Verse]
I had to trap in my nike sweats with the lil quarter in my deep pocket
I was up bout to go to work with my 8 but he copped out so i de-cocked it
I was out there posted on the duece from down there where the brothers sold fake profit
We was selling them dimes,but we taking nines,sometimes we even took eight dollars
You could swim in that water you drown in it,niggas be snakes so i watch my surroundings
I don’t do parties unless i get the pound in,and i do numbers like i’m an accountant
Jah’ died and it fucked with my head,when the bad bitch come through and fuck with my bread
My judge good and ion hear nothin he sayin,bro was killing he don’t work round’ nothin’ he did
When it’s on we ain’t showin no mercy, we wet a opp in his face like he thirsty
I’m on that graveyard shift like they cursed me, i gave my youngin’ the pack cause he sturdy
Run with them demons we run through we takin’, put on my mask and get back to the basics
My shorty killin’ he fresh outta’ placement, i’m from where they found the bodies in the basement
We was trappin’ the work you was tappin’ the work tryna make extra fore’ you get high, I was settin a pick, I was runnin’ that global, the only way that i’ma get by
You ain’t showin’ no love you just dick ride,niggas killa’s they never let shit slide
Everytime i get locked up, i bail out, you was out there promoting the fish fry
When I die bury me in the dickie
I wasn’t innocent i just dropped 50
I got lil bitch badder than Nikki
She just wanna fuck and roll the sticky
When them guns come out you gon’ win,call boy in that field i’m too real oh win
Shoot a opp in his top leave his shell showin’
Ion’ trust these niggas ian’ got no friends
Told my youngin’ these streets ain’t good
Still a killer but i know he misunderstood
Gave my burner to my lil bitch from the hood
I’m a demon for real ain’t no bitch in my blood
When i’m posted i just put my gun on the wood
I be tossed to the side while I’m done with the pills
You a spoiler you don’t know how none of us feel
When i get outta’ jail i’ma run up a mill
Call me Jeff with this ladder
Semi-shorty gone fuck up ya bladder
On the low lotta’ niggas be catter
.22 or lil uzi it don’t matter
I was stuck on the block with them killas’,them rapers them dealers you know these niggas don’t play round’
I was stuck in the cell for the night
I can’t even go out cause they havin’ a shakedown
Niggas feeding you lies and you listen, now you can go on this ride if you bitchin’
I took my bruva Jay out on a mission,now he always want slide if he skissin
I did the race like Tay-K
Put a capital C in my AK
I told him give me a trae-way
I go to work with that whistle like Dae Dae

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

[Chorus]
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

[Verse 2]
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise, there, you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never, ne-ne-never

I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much

Any time I got is your time
Any of time to spend is no crime
I got a room for you at my place
(Do you really wanna go?)
I got a room for you don't hesitate
(Do you really need me?)

[Verse]
You don't even call my name like you used to
You don't even scream for more
You don't even walk the same like you used to
I guess you don't want me no more
Alive for fine if you don't trust in me
But lying eventually stopped our destiny
(Shiit)

[Chorus 2]
You still hang around doing nothing
(Do you really want me?)
I still find time to give you something
(Do you really need me?)
You don't even call my name like you use to
(Want me, need me)
You don't even scream for more
(Want me, need me)
You don't even walk the same like you use to

Do you remember you used to scream for more?
Do you remember you used to come for more?
(You got to forgive me)
Do you remember when you crashed for more?

Eight and a half is not enough anymore?
(You got to forgive me)
You don't even call my name like you used to
(You got to forgive me)
You don't even walk the same no more

You don't even shout my name like you used to

The bitch don't want me no more

Let me go ahead and knock the seal off the ceiling wall/
Cast-iron genes and they are never ever going to rust nor crumble/
Prepeare the world for my demise and villianous warfare/

Wait awhile and smile like a litle child/

"
249,25327,Orchard,Fouk,"[In a field. An old, crooked shrine, which has been long abandoned; near it a well and large stones, which apparently are old tombstones, and an old garden seat. The road is seen to GAEV'S estate. On one side rise dark poplars, behind them begins the cherry orchard. In the distance is a row of telegraph poles, and far, far away on the horizon are the indistinct signs of a large town, which can only be seen on the finest and clearest days. It is close on sunset. CHARLOTTA, YASHA, and DUNYASHA are sitting on the seat; EPIKHODOV stands by and plays on a guitar; all seem thoughtful. CHARLOTTA wears a man's old peaked cap; she has unslung a rifle from her shoulders and is putting to rights the buckle on the strap.]

CHARLOTTA.
[Thoughtfully] I haven't a real passport. I don't know how old I am, and I think I'm young. When I was a little girl my father and mother used to go round fairs and give very good performances and I used to do the salto mortale and various little things. And when papa and mamma died a German lady took me to her and began to teach me. I liked it. I grew up and became a governess. And where I came from and who I am, I don't know.... Who my parents were—perhaps they weren't married—I don't know. [Takes a cucumber out of her pocket and eats] I don't know anything. [Pause] I do want to talk, but I haven't anybody to talk to... I haven't anybody at all.

EPIKHODOV.
[Plays on the guitar and sings]

             ""What is this noisy earth to me,
             What matter friends and foes?""
             I do like playing on the mandoline!

DUNYASHA.
That's a guitar, not a mandoline. [Looks at herself in a little mirror and powders herself.]

EPIKHODOV.
For the enamoured madman, this is a mandoline. [Sings]

             ""Oh that the heart was warmed,
             By all the flames of love returned!""
[YASHA sings too.]

CHARLOTTA.
These people sing terribly.... Foo! Like jackals.

DUNYASHA.
[To YASHA] Still, it must be nice to live abroad.

YASHA.
Yes, certainly. I cannot differ from you there. [Yawns and lights a cigar.]

EPIKHODOV.
That is perfectly natural. Abroad everything is in full complexity.

YASHA.
That goes without saying.

EPIKHODOV.
I'm an educated man, I read various remarkable books, but I cannot understand the direction I myself want to go—whether to live or to shoot myself, as it were. So, in case, I always carry a revolver about with me. Here it is. [Shows a revolver.]

CHARLOTTA.
I've done. Now I'll go. [Slings the rifle] You, Epikhodov, are a very clever man and very terrible; women must be madly in love with you. Brrr! [Going] These wise ones are all so stupid. I've nobody to talk to. I'm always alone, alone; I've nobody at all... and I don't know who I am or why I live. [Exit slowly.]

EPIKHODOV.
As a matter of fact, independently of everything else, I must express my feeling, among other things, that fate has been as pitiless in her dealings with me as a storm is to a small ship. Suppose, let us grant, I am wrong; then why did I wake up this morning, to give an example, and behold an enormous spider on my chest, like that. [Shows with both hands] And if I do drink some kvass, why is it that there is bound to be something of the most indelicate nature in it, such as a beetle? [Pause] Have you read Buckle? [Pause] I should like to trouble you, Avdotya Fedorovna, for two words.

DUNYASHA.
Say on.

EPIKHODOV.
I should prefer to be alone with you. [Sighs.]

DUNYASHA.
[Shy] Very well, only first bring me my little cloak.... It's by the cupboard. It's a little damp here.

EPIKHODOV.
Very well... I'll bring it.... Now I know what to do with my revolver. [Takes guitar and exits, strumming.]

YASHA.
Two-and-twenty troubles! A silly man, between you and me and the gatepost. [Yawns.]

DUNYASHA.
I hope to goodness he won't shoot himself. [Pause] I'm so nervous, I'm worried. I went into service when I was quite a little girl, and now I'm not used to common life, and my hands are white, white as a lady's. I'm so tender and so delicate now; respectable and afraid of everything.... I'm so frightened. And I don't know what will happen to my nerves if you deceive me, Yasha.

YASHA.
[Kisses her] Little cucumber! Of course, every girl must respect herself; there's nothing I dislike more than a badly behaved girl.

DUNYASHA.
I'm awfully in love with you; you're educated, you can talk about everything. [Pause.]

YASHA.
[Yawns] Yes. I think this: if a girl loves anybody, then that means she's immoral. [Pause] It's nice to smoke a cigar out in the open air.... [Listens] Somebody's coming. It's the mistress, and people with her. [DUNYASHA embraces him suddenly] Go to the house, as if you'd been bathing in the river; go by this path, or they'll meet you and will think I've been meeting you. I can't stand that sort of thing.

DUNYASHA.
[Coughs quietly] My head's aching because of your cigar.

[Exit. YASHA remains, sitting by the shrine. Enter LUBOV ANDREYEVNA, GAEV, and LOPAKHIN.]

LOPAKHIN.
You must make up your mind definitely—there's no time to waste. The question is perfectly plain. Are you willing to let the land for villas or no? Just one word, yes or no? Just one word!

LUBOV.
Who's smoking horrible cigars here? [Sits.]

GAEV.
They built that railway; that's made this place very handy. [Sits] Went to town and had lunch... red in the middle! I'd like to go in now and have just one game.

LUBOV.
You'll have time.

LOPAKHIN.
Just one word! [Imploringly] Give me an answer!

GAEV.
[Yawns] Really!

LUBOV.
[Looks in her purse] I had a lot of money yesterday, but there's very little to-day. My poor Varya feeds everybody on milk soup to save money, in the kitchen the old people only get peas, and I spend recklessly. [Drops the purse, scattering gold coins] There, they are all over the place.

YASHA.
Permit me to pick them up. [Collects the coins.]

LUBOV.
Please do, Yasha. And why did I go and have lunch there?... A horrid restaurant with band and tablecloths smelling of soap.... Why do you drink so much, Leon? Why do you eat so much? Why do you talk so much? You talked again too much to-day in the restaurant, and it wasn't at all to the point—about the seventies and about decadents. And to whom? Talking to the waiters about decadents!

LOPAKHIN.
Yes.

GAEV.
[Waves his hand] I can't be cured, that's obvious.... [Irritably to YASHA] What's the matter? Why do you keep twisting about in front of me?

YASHA.
[Laughs] I can't listen to your voice without laughing.

GAEV.
[To his sister] Either he or I...

LUBOV.
Go away, Yasha; get out of this....

YASHA.
[Gives purse to LUBOV ANDREYEVNA] I'll go at once. [Hardly able to keep from laughing] This minute.... [Exit.]

LOPAKHIN.
That rich man Deriganov is preparing to buy your estate. They say he'll come to the sale himself.

LUBOV.
Where did you hear that?

LOPAKHIN.
They say so in town.

GAEV.
Our Yaroslav aunt has promised to send something, but I don't know when or how much.

LOPAKHIN.
How much will she send? A hundred thousand roubles? Or two, perhaps?

LUBOV.
I'd be glad of ten or fifteen thousand.

LOPAKHIN.
You must excuse my saying so, but I've never met such frivolous people as you before, or anybody so unbusinesslike and peculiar. Here I am telling you in plain language that your estate will be sold, and you don't seem to understand.

LUBOV.
What are we to do? Tell us, what?

LOPAKHIN.
I tell you every day. I say the same thing every day. Both the cherry orchard and the land must be leased off for villas and at once, immediately—the auction is staring you in the face: Understand! Once you do definitely make up your minds to the villas, then you'll have as much money as you want and you'll be saved.

LUBOV.
Villas and villa residents—it's so vulgar, excuse me.

GAEV.
I entirely agree with you.

LOPAKHIN.
I must cry or yell or faint. I can't stand it! You're too much for me! [To GAEV] You old woman!

GAEV.
Really!

LOPAKHIN.
Old woman! [Going out.]

LUBOV.
[Frightened] No, don't go away, do stop; be a dear. Please. Perhaps we'll find some way out!

LOPAKHIN.
What's the good of trying to think!

LUBOV.
Please don't go away. It's nicer when you're here.... [Pause] I keep on waiting for something to happen, as if the house is going to collapse over our heads.

GAEV.
[Thinking deeply] Double in the corner... across the middle....

LUBOV.
We have been too sinful....

LOPAKHIN.
What sins have you committed?

GAEV.
[Puts candy into his mouth] They say that I've eaten all my substance in sugar-candies. [Laughs.]

LUBOV.
Oh, my sins.... I've always scattered money about without holding myself in, like a madwoman, and I married a man who made nothing but debts. My husband died of champagne—he drank terribly—and to my misfortune, I fell in love with another man and went off with him, and just at that time—it was my first punishment, a blow that hit me right on the head—here, in the river... my boy was drowned, and I went away, quite away, never to return, never to see this river again...I shut my eyes and ran without thinking, but he ran after me... without pity, without respect. I bought a villa near Mentone because he fell ill there, and for three years I knew no rest either by day or night; the sick man wore me out, and my soul dried up. And last year, when they had sold the villa to pay my debts, I went away to Paris, and there he robbed me of all I had and threw me over and went off with another woman. I tried to poison myself.... It was so silly, so shameful.... And suddenly I longed to be back in Russia, my own land, with my little girl.... [Wipes her tears] Lord, Lord be merciful to me, forgive me my sins! Punish me no more! [Takes a telegram out of her pocket] I had this to-day from Paris.... He begs my forgiveness, he implores me to return.... [Tears it up] Don't I hear music? [Listens.]

GAEV.
That is our celebrated Jewish band. You remember—four violins, a flute, and a double-bass.

LUBOV
So it still exists? It would be nice if they came along some evening.

LOPAKHIN.
[Listens] I can't hear.... [Sings quietly] ""For money will the Germans make a Frenchman of a Russian."" [Laughs] I saw such an awfully funny thing at the theatre last night.

LUBOV.
I'm quite sure there wasn't anything at all funny. You oughtn't to go and see plays, you ought to go and look at yourself. What a grey life you lead, what a lot you talk unnecessarily.

LOPAKHIN.
It's true. To speak the straight truth, we live a silly life. [Pause] My father was a peasant, an idiot, he understood nothing, he didn't teach me, he was always drunk, and always used a stick on me. In point of fact, I'm a fool and an idiot too. I've never learned anything, my handwriting is bad, I write so that I'm quite ashamed before people, like a pig!

LUBOV.
You ought to get married, my friend.

LOPAKHIN.
Yes... that's true.

LUBOV.
Why not to our Varya? She's a nice girl.

LOPAKHIN.
Yes.

LUBOV.
She's quite homely in her ways, works all day, and, what matters most, she's in love with you. And you've liked her for a long time.

LOPAKHIN.
Well? I don't mind... she's a nice girl. [Pause.]

GAEV.
I'm offered a place in a bank. Six thousand roubles a year.... Did you hear?

LUBOV.
What's the matter with you! Stay where you are....

[Enter FIERS with an overcoat.]

FIERS.
[To GAEV] Please, sir, put this on, it's damp.

GAEV.
[Putting it on] You're a nuisance, old man.

FIERS
It's all very well.... You went away this morning without telling me. [Examining GAEV.]

LUBOV.
How old you've grown, Fiers!

FIERS.
I beg your pardon?

LOPAKHIN.
She says you've grown very old!

FIERS.
I've been alive a long time. They were already getting ready to marry me before your father was born.... [Laughs] And when the Emancipation came I was already first valet. Only I didn't agree with the Emancipation and remained with my people.... [Pause] I remember everybody was happy, but they didn't know why.

LOPAKHIN.
It was very good for them in the old days. At any rate, they used to beat them.

FIERS.
[Not hearing] Rather. The peasants kept their distance from the masters and the masters kept their distance from the peasants, but now everything's all anyhow and you can't understand anything.

GAEV.
Be quiet, Fiers. I've got to go to town tomorrow. I've been promised an introduction to a General who may lend me money on a bill.

LOPAKHIN.
Nothing will come of it. And you won't pay your interest, don't you worry.

LUBOV.
He's talking rubbish. There's no General at all.

[Enter TROFIMOV, ANYA, and VARYA.]

GAEV.
Here they are.

ANYA.
Mother's sitting down here.

LUBOV.
[Tenderly] Come, come, my dears.... [Embracing ANYA and VARYA] If you two only knew how much I love you. Sit down next to me, like that. [All sit down.]

LOPAKHIN.
Our eternal student is always with the ladies.

TROFIMOV.
That's not your business.

LOPAKHIN.
He'll soon be fifty, and he's still a student.

TROFIMOV.
Leave off your silly jokes!

LOPAKHIN.
Getting angry, eh, silly?

TROFIMOV.
Shut up, can't you.

LOPAKHIN.
[Laughs] I wonder what you think of me?

TROFIMOV.
I think, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that you're a rich man, and you'll soon be a millionaire. Just as the wild beast which eats everything it finds is needed for changes to take place in matter, so you are needed too.

[All laugh.]

VARYA.
Better tell us something about the planets, Peter.

LUBOV ANDREYEVNA.
No, let's go on with yesterday's talk!

TROFIMOV.
About what?

GAEV.
About the proud man.

TROFIMOV.
Yesterday we talked for a long time but we didn't come to anything in the end. There's something mystical about the proud man, in your sense. Perhaps you are right from your point of view, but if you take the matter simply, without complicating it, then what pride can there be, what sense can there be in it, if a man is imperfectly made, physiologically speaking, if in the vast majority of cases he is coarse and stupid and deeply unhappy? We must stop admiring one another. We must work, nothing more.

GAEV.
You'll die, all the same.

TROFIMOV.
Who knows? And what does it mean—you'll die? Perhaps a man has a hundred senses, and when he dies only the five known to us are destroyed and the remaining ninety-five are left alive.

LUBOV.
How clever of you, Peter!

LOPAKHIN.
[Ironically] Oh, awfully!

TROFIMOV.
The human race progresses, perfecting its powers. Everything that is unattainable now will some day be near at hand and comprehensible, but we must work, we must help with all our strength those who seek to know what fate will bring. Meanwhile in Russia only a very few of us work. The vast majority of those intellectuals whom I know seek for nothing, do nothing, and are at present incapable of hard work. They call themselves intellectuals, but they use ""thou"" and ""thee"" to their servants, they treat the peasants like animals, they learn badly, they read nothing seriously, they do absolutely nothing, about science they only talk, about art they understand little. They are all serious, they all have severe faces, they all talk about important things. They philosophize, and at the same time, the vast majority of us, ninety-nine out of a hundred, live like savages, fighting and cursing at the slightest opportunity, eating filthily, sleeping in the dirt, in stuffiness, with fleas, stinks, smells, moral filth, and so on... And it's obvious that all our nice talk is only carried on to distract ourselves and others. Tell me, where are those créches we hear so much of? and where are those reading-rooms? People only write novels about them; they don't really exist. Only dirt, vulgarity, and Asiatic plagues really exist.... I'm afraid, and I don't at all like serious faces; I don't like serious conversations. Let's be quiet sooner.

LOPAKHIN.
You know, I get up at five every morning, I work from morning till evening, I am always dealing with money—my own and other people's—and I see what people are like. You've only got to begin to do anything to find out how few honest, honourable people there are. Sometimes, when I can't sleep, I think: ""Oh Lord, you've given us huge forests, infinite fields, and endless horizons, and we, living here, ought really to be giants.""

LUBOV.
You want giants, do you?... They're only good in stories, and even there they frighten one. [EPIKHODOV enters at the back of the stage playing his guitar. Thoughtfully:] Epikhodov's there.

ANYA.
[Thoughtfully] Epikhodov's there.

GAEV.
The sun's set, ladies and gentlemen.

TROFIMOV.
Yes.

GAEV
[Not loudly, as if declaiming] O Nature, thou art wonderful, thou shinest with eternal radiance! Oh, beautiful and indifferent one, thou whom we call mother, thou containest in thyself existence and death, thou livest and destroyest....

VARYA.
[Entreatingly] Uncle, dear!

ANYA.
Uncle, you're doing it again!

TROFIMOV.
You'd better double the red into the middle.

GAEV.
I'll be quiet, I'll be quiet.

[They all sit thoughtfully. It is quiet. Only the mumbling of FIERS is heard. Suddenly a distant sound is heard as if from the sky, the sound of a breaking string, which dies away sadly.]

LUBOV.
What's that?

LOPAKHIN.
I don't know. It may be a bucket fallen down a well somewhere. But it's some way off.

GAEV.
Or perhaps it's some bird... like a heron.

TROFIMOV.
Or an owl.

LUBOV.
[Shudders] It's unpleasant, somehow. [A pause.]

FIERS.
Before the misfortune the same thing happened. An owl screamed and the samovar hummed without stopping.

GAEV.
Before what misfortune?

FIERS.
Before the Emancipation. [A pause.]

LUBOV.
You know, my friends, let's go in; it's evening now. [To ANYA] You've tears in your eyes.... What is it, little girl? [Embraces her.]

ANYA.
It's nothing, mother.

TROFIMOV.
Some one's coming.

[Enter a TRAMP in an old white peaked cap and overcoat. He is a little drunk.]

TRAMP.
Excuse me, may I go this way straight through to the station?

GAEV.
You may. Go along this path.

TRAMP.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart. [Hiccups] Lovely weather.... [Declaims] My brother, my suffering brother.... Come out on the Volga, you whose groans... [To VARYA] Mademoiselle, please give a hungry Russian thirty copecks....

[VARYA
screams, frightened.]

LOPAKHIN.
[Angrily] There's manners everybody's got to keep!

LUBOV.
[With a start] Take this... here you are.... [Feels in her purse] There's no silver.... It doesn't matter, here's gold.

TRAMP.
I am deeply grateful to you! [Exit. Laughter.]

VARYA.
[Frightened] I'm going, I'm going.... Oh, little mother, at home there's nothing for the servants to eat, and you gave him gold.

LUBOV.
What is to be done with such a fool as I am! At home I'll give you everything I've got. Ermolai Alexeyevitch, lend me some more!...

LOPAKHIN.
Very well.

LUBOV.
Let's go, it's time. And Varya, we've settled your affair; I congratulate you.

VARYA.
[Crying] You shouldn't joke about this, mother.

LOPAKHIN.
Oh, feel me, get thee to a nunnery.

GAEV.
My hands are all trembling; I haven't played billiards for a long time.

LOPAKHIN.
Oh, feel me, nymph, remember me in thine orisons.

LUBOV.
Come along; it'll soon be supper-time.

VARYA.
He did frighten me. My heart is beating hard.

LOPAKHIN.
Let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, on August 22 the cherry orchard will be sold. Think of that!... Think of that!...

[All go out except TROFIMOV and ANYA.]

ANYA.
[Laughs] Thanks to the tramp who frightened Barbara, we're alone now.

TROFIMOV.
Varya's afraid we may fall in love with each other and won't get away from us for days on end. Her narrow mind won't allow her to understand that we are above love. To escape all the petty and deceptive things which prevent our being happy and free, that is the aim and meaning of our lives. Forward! We go irresistibly on to that bright star which burns there, in the distance! Don't lag behind, friends!

ANYA.
[Clapping her hands] How beautifully you talk! [Pause] It is glorious here to-day!

TROFIMOV.
Yes, the weather is wonderful.

ANYA.
What have you done to me, Peter? I don't love the cherry orchard as I used to. I loved it so tenderly, I thought there was no better place in the world than our orchard.

TROFIMOV.
All Russia is our orchard. The land is great and beautiful, there are many marvellous places in it. [Pause] Think, Anya, your grandfather, your great-grandfather, and all your ancestors were serf-owners, they owned living souls; and now, doesn't something human look at you from every cherry in the orchard, every leaf and every stalk? Don't you hear voices...? Oh, it's awful, your orchard is terrible; and when in the evening or at night you walk through the orchard, then the old bark on the trees sheds a dim light and the old cherry-trees seem to be dreaming of all that was a hundred, two hundred years ago, and are oppressed by their heavy visions. Still, at any rate, we've left those two hundred years behind us. So far we've gained nothing at all—we don't yet know what the past is to be to us—we only philosophize, we complain that we are dull, or we drink vodka. For it's so clear that in order to begin to live in the present we must first redeem the past, and that can only be done by suffering, by strenuous, uninterrupted labour. Understand that, Anya.

ANYA.
The house in which we live has long ceased to be our house; I shall go away. I give you my word.

TROFIMOV.
If you have the housekeeping keys, throw them down the well and go away. Be as free as the wind.

ANYA.
[Enthusiastically] How nicely you said that!

TROFIMOV.
Believe me, Anya, believe me! I'm not thirty yet, I'm young, I'm still a student, but I have undergone a great deal! I'm as hungry as the winter, I'm ill, I'm shaken. I'm as poor as a beggar, and where haven't I been—fate has tossed me everywhere! But my soul is always my own; every minute of the day and the night it is filled with unspeakable presentiments. I know that happiness is coming, Anya, I see it already....

ANYA.
[Thoughtful] The moon is rising.

[EPIKHODOV is heard playing the same sad song on his guitar. The moon rises. Somewhere by the poplars VARYA is looking for ANYA and calling, ""Anya, where are you?""]

TROFIMOV.
Yes, the moon has risen. [Pause] There is happiness, there it comes; it comes nearer and nearer; I hear its steps already. And if we do not see it we shall not know it, but what does that matter? Others will see it!

THE VOICE OF VARYA.
Anya! Where are you?

TROFIMOV.
That's Varya again! [Angry] Disgraceful!

ANYA.
Never mind. Let's go to the river. It's nice there.

TROFIMOV
Let's go. [They go out.]

THE VOICE OF VARYA.
Anya! Anya!

Hide my face, Hide my face
You make me hide my face
When God comes around

[Verse 1:]
Hickory, dickory don’t ridicule me
Hiding like I came in with a hickey on me
Hickety pickety don’t pick my pockets
Pull a rabbit out my brain
The Pinky on me
Pikachu, peek-a-boo you see me
Covering my face my shame is creeping on me
Peeping Tom is peeking at me from behind the curtains
Pickled peppers, why are you picking on me?
You don’t even love me
You don’t even want me
I carried your load but I camе and I’m dumping that
Deep in the laps of desire
Thеn I woke to the horns of the piper
I said I was done but I turn and I’m coming back
What you fishing for?
Watch your fishing pole
Grab a rat and let it point you to the cheese
Grab a banshee let it point you to the grief
I’m digging up the place from where my face was hid

[Chorus:]
Hide my face, Hide my face
You make me hide my face
When God comes around
Saved by grace, I live by faith
So, if I hide my face
I’d be buried alive

[Verse 2:]
Keep on calling, do you?
Ain’t it boring to you?
I felt this pain until I numbed me to you
Thought I was rid of you
And then I bump into you
As you cast your net out for a cast away
To then fish a face out from the catch away
It had rained cats and dogs out on my rainy day
I prayed that revival rain would wash shame away
(Would wash shshshshshsh)
Corny like a cornrow, I’d become a cliché
If for help I turn to the Michael Jackson killer
If I hide my face then I’m a zombie
Hanging out my grave, the Michael Jackson thriller
Limping on a limb, the hippity hop
Rocking back and forth, I did the Diddy bop
Hiding like I came in with a hickey on me?
Hickory, dickory don’t ridicule me

[Chorus:]
Hide my face, Hide my face
You make me hide my face
When God comes around
Saved by grace, I live by faith
So, if I hide my face
I’d be buried alive

Столько взлётов и падений
Столько разных приключений
Ждёт меня

For you dear only
Why haven't you seen it?

And wondering why it's me, you're wronging
I tell you, I mean it
I'm all for you

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending it looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours, for just the taking

And someone tries to touch you
Like you're a piece of meat
Have you ever been out dancin' in a club
And somebody beside you
Tries to rub their body
Up on you and
You just want to say..hey

Get your hands off my Coconuts
'Cause I don't really like you that much
Keep your hands off my Coconuts
I don't know what gave you the idea that you could touch

Boys
Have you ever been out surfing for the day
You try and do the pipeline
And get dumped by the wave
And later that night you party on the beach (ohh he hi he)
With all the pretty surfy girls oh yeah
You pick up good vibrations

Thinking over all the things you said to me, you said to me…

Pretty soon there'll be nowhere left to run away, to run away…

You packed your bags to leave by the morning
Destination far off and foreign
It's never or now…
It's never or now…

Baby won't you take me
Baby won't you take me with you, with you…
Baby won't you take me
Baby won't you take me with you, with you…

Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone tonight…
Baby won't you take me
Baby won't you take me with you, with you…

Memories of a life I leave behind
Take a souvenir to remind me of the ones I love…

Feel my heart it beats like a stopwatch
Running out of time with each tick tock
It's never or now…

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 a.m., summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out ""Fuck that""
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turnin' back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

[Chorus: Andrew VanWyngarden & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
5 a.m., cold sweats, waking up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

That you had when we were children yesterday
You watched it fade
Let your heart be your religion
Let it break you out of this prison you became
It’s not too late

I dare you to love
I dare you to cry
I dare you to run
I dare you to try
I dare you to fall
And lay on the ground

342,25450,Sweet Nothing,Calvin Harris,"[Verse 1]
You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus]
So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

[Chorus]
So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'

[Drop]

[Bridge]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing (Woah, woah, woah)
Nothing

Woah, woah, woah, sweet nothin' (Woah)
Woah, woah, woah, sweet nothin' (Woah)

If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

[Verse 2]
If I don't need you, then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with
I hope, I love you all my life

'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?

I need to hide away and catch my breath

Leave my phone, I'm driving south of it

Had enough of the same old time
My senses they need reviving
Given up on just getting by
It's time for a brand new feeling

Let's all do something incredible
Make it happen when we come together
Just stay in here, it's so wonderful
Incredible!

I'm gonna beat it to the highest high
There's such a place, it moves me up and over my life
It's so amazing what I'm feeling now
Thank you for it, bless this house

We only comfort when times are hard
Come on and hide away
There's no pretense here

Don't need a thing, leave your credit card
Put it all behind

Had enough of the same old vibe
All our senses they need reviving
Given up, we're on borrowed time
Make way for a brand new feeling

Let's all do something incredible
Make it happen when we come together
Just stay in here, it's so wonderful

White Lady White Powder - Elton John, Bernie Taupi

Dust settles on a thin cloud

Sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd

I've had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours

Staring at a line of white powder

High-priced madness pays the tab

I've scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag

I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had

A touch too much of white powder

And she's a habit I can't handle

For a reason I can't say

I'm in love with a wild white lady

She's as sweet as the stories say

White powder white lady

You're one and the same

Come on down to my house won't you

And hit this boy again

Shock waves to a tired brain

Sends that hungry lady to my door again

She's my shelter from the storm when I feel the rain

Entertaining white powder

I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied

Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride

I might just escape while the others might die

Riding on a high of white powder

I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied

Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride

I might just escape while the others might die

Riding on a high of white powder

Quémales la casa, no tienen perdón
Te odian porque escuchas a DEF CON DOS

Ready to be free
Chasing every thrill we could see
With our eyes steady
Waking into a dream
Aching to be thrown in the ring
If nothing comes easy as long as we’re breathing
We’ll go all the way or go home
We were born ready
Wherever it leads
What we have is all we need

Is I’m gonna enjoy the ride
And if it’s hard or soft before we get off

Hungry for the rush
Screaming when they tell us to hush
Hit the ground running
Leave them in the dust
Only run with those we can trust
If nothing comes to us, we'll fly where it’s bluest
We’re ready to face the unknown
We were born hungry, we’ll never get enough
‘Cause we’re only here this once

And if it’s hard or soft before we get off

Hat cocked, can't see his eyes—who could it be?
With that new, blue Yankee on—who but me?
Niggas shipped two million, then I blew the three
Then I skated the four 'fore I went on tour
I came back and it's plain: Y'all niggas ain't rappin' the same
Fuck the flow—y'all jackin' our slang
I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrows, tryna wild out
The game is ours—we'll never foul out
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out
Throw your hands up—niggas, bitches, busters
Hustlers, fuck that! (Throw they hands up) C'mon!

[Chorus: Amil, Jay-Z, & Barron Ricks sample]
12 a.m., on the way to the club (Throw they hands up,uh huh)
1 a.m., 'bout to shake the butt (Throw they hands up, ugh, 'bout to shake the butt)
2 a.m., now I'm checkin' the mink (Ah, yeah, hot-ass bitch)
3 a.m., now he buyin' me drinks (What you drinkin' on?)
4 a.m., exit the club (Throw they hands up, let's go)
5 a.m., think he gettin' some butt (Throw they hands up,that's right)
6 a.m., nigga still ain't bust (What?)
6:15, nigga, we'll get up (Throw they hands up, ugh, I'm out)
7 a.m. gotta tell my friends (Throw they hands up, uh-huh)
12 a.m., I'ma do it again
Ugh, ugh, I'ma do it again
12 a.m., we gon' do it again

I give my all
But it means nothing
It means nothing
Without You

But it means nothing

[Verse 1]
Would you believe me If I told you I was cold and alone
Living with the knowledge that I've broken a home
There's a fire in my heart and ice in my veins
I'm fighting the pain 'cause my nights ain't the same
Since You're gone
When I'm with You, I'm alive
When I'm not, I survive
Every time I walk away, there's a part of me that dies
If my heart could beat at twice O da’ the speed it does already
I'll spend every single minute chasing You  like Tom and Jerry

I told You I would come back
Told You I would fight back
Told You I would get my act together, get my life back
And if you're like me, you can empathize with the times
When I told you, you were nothing, they were lies
Now I'm about to show you what it's like
When there is light in the darkness
And how its shine bright when it's honest
It doesn’t matter if we were light-years apart
'Cause you'll still find a path to my heart

[Chorus]
I give my all
But it means nothing
It means nothing
Without You
I give my all
But it means nothing
It means nothing
Without You

[Verse 2]
My mind’s eye can’t forget the first time that we met
My heart fell apart and You put it back again
All the pain in my chest that was killing me regressed
Into nothing
And now I'm left, knowing You're here with me
My soul feels alive
You're there for the dark nights
There for the hard fights
Leave the hard times for the archives
With-with You there's no fear
That False evidence appearing real disappears

[Chorus]
I give my all
But it means nothing
It means nothing
Without You
I give my all
But it means nothing (it means nothing)
It means nothing
Without You

[Chorus+outro]
I give my all
The pain
But it means nothing
The tears
It means nothing
The same old fear
Without You
The shame
They hidden in the valley of the shadow of death

[Chorus]
I give my all
But it means nothing
It means nothing
Without You
I give my all
But it means nothing
It means nothing
Without You

I give my all
But it means nothing
It means nothing
Without You
I give my all
But it means nothing
It means nothing
Without You

Makes me feel like waves are crashing down around me

These waves is crashing down
These waves, These waves, These waves is crashing down (x2)

[Verse 1]

Bong water ocean blue
Moved out to Cali just for the view
The weed came with and the bitches came too
It was low tide when I walked in
Before I knew it I was waste deep
I thought we on the same team, chasing the same dream
Till the water started rising up
Times got tough
Niggas started talking shit
I'm like shit
What the fuck should I do?
Should I go with the crew or stand on my own two?
Do what another man said I won't do
Grab the rolls now I roll in the old school
Smoke a dro, fucking hoes like i'm supposed to
Doing shows, gettin' dough like you won't do

I light it up to be free
Livin' in 3D, off this weed

I wanna take another hit and just chill
It's coming down like rain on my windshield
When the cup fills over then it's gon' spill
But i'm never gonna let it break a niggas will
In the 25th hour, standing in the middle of a downpour
It's 420 on board
Cause we on course
Headed on an underwater expedition
Niggas wouldn't listen when I said I wasn't fishin'
I crush all the competition
They was on another tip, I was on some other shit
Rollin' up another spliff just for the fuck of it
Just cause i'm in love with it

And I can't let go
To the trees I smoke
I get it by the O
It's amazing
So

I light it up to be free
Livin' in 3D, off this weed

Close your eyes, leave all fear behind and hold me by the hand

Yeah you know just want it’s got to be

I’ve been trying, I’ve trying, to keep a straight face
But you know when it’s real, and you know when it ain’t
I’ve been trying, I’ve trying, trying to play it cool
But it never ever works, I be making things worse
I’ve been playing in the dirt, praying in the church
Doing everything, trying to cover up the hurt
See I've been, living on an island, singing these sad songs, playing on the violin
Do you hear the sirens, can you hear the silence
Can you hear my thoughts, do you know where my mind is?
Are you appalled, aye do you need a Silas
I know it’s my fault, I’m just trying to be honest

Now that I know what the problem is, I was afraid to acknowledge it
You know I never meant to hurt you so, but it’s ok to take it personal
Now I don’t know what you think of me, and I don’t know if you still love me
Do you still want me, Are you proud of me, Am I still worth it, even though I’m unperfect
I got a whole bunch of imperfections, I really hope you got the message
I keep trying to earn, what I don’t deserve, still trying to count my blessings
And I’m open to suggestions, yea I’m trying to learn some lessons
But one thing that I learned, you got to just let it burn, these are all of my confessions
Its hard to accept it, I don’t do good with rejection, I don’t do good with reflections
Sometimes I be flexing and feeling myself, but sometimes I wish I was somebody else
All of these things I be feeling inside, look, its just a matter of time, hey
As far as your eye can see, I think you know what it got to be

Yeah you know just want it’s got to be

476,25645,Face Down,Benjah,"[Verse 1:]
I keep on fighting the struggle, Pickin me up out the ruble
You are my rock and my shelter, Hold me up against the rain
Can't read a book by its cover, Open the window and shudder
Might see the pain that i suffer, I'm just growin in my lane

What if i call it what it is though
We can keep on runnin circles but its spiritual
I drop it all i trust i follow
This will be one for the books yea like a miracle

[Pre:]
I crumble to pieces when i’m with you
More than i have needed no substitute
You are the number one reason why i salute
I'm fallen for you, face down, face face down

[Verse 2:]
I know you hear me, why don't you don't answer
Been drifting for too long in this new chapter
The currents crazy, it's moving faster
I'm giving all i got, i'm not an actor

Ok lord you got my time and you got my attention
I hear you calling right now
It’s crazy how far we run, we create our addictions
I will be stronger somehow

[Bridge:]
I know this will pass, cause i know it's a test
The timing is yours, so i know that i'm a blessed man
I must confess man, you give me rest and
Take it all away, my depression

Running with me running with me yea
Never will be, never will be alone

482,25602,You Are God,Sevin,"Yeah
The only thing consistent is You
You’re the same yesterday, today, and forever
My problems change but You stay the same
Come on

[Chorus: Sevin]
You love me
I cursed you
You’re beautiful
I’m ugly and I don’t deserve you
You’ve got me singing ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
You are God
You are God
You got me singing ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah you are God

[Verse 1: Sevin]
Yes I’m too intellectually inclined for me to rest in the deception
That my flesh gone be just fine
No it definitely is dying
What threatens me is time
To make sure that there is more than just some debt I leave behind
So I bless the beat with rhyme
On a quest to feed your mind
The recipe to set you free can’t let you be this blind
Brotha
You’re seeking pleasure that gets weathered in it’s time
Heaven’s only heaven if forever’s intertwined
And I’m feeling so blessed beneath his shine
Severed from my debt to be accepted in His line
I’m savoring my Savior put my effort to His grind
Long as I’m in His favor I will never need a dime
What He gave to me is paper free It’s real mane it ain’t make believe
This will change your diet homie try it bro just taste and see
And you will never thirst or hunger
I’m telling ya fella
That He’s the umbrella you put your hurts up under

[Chorus: Sevin]
You love me
I cursed you
You’re beautiful
I’m ugly and I don’t deserve you
You’ve got me singing ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
You are God
You are God
You got me singing ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah you are God

[Verse 2: Sevin]
And they used to be thunder but brother sun is shining finally in my life
There’s drama sometimes it do get grimy but it’s my life
He’s the twilight I just reflect His shine guess I’m a skylight
You gotta play the game and press rewind to see the highlights
And I might not be the purest but I’m a purist
And the Spirit’s telling me to endure it so I’m encouraged
To remind myself I shouldn’t define myself by my weaknesses
I’m freakin’ His, we can live ‘cause of what Jesus did
So Hallelujah
I know Yeshua is His true name
Christian is my new game
And wisdom is my boo thang
My view’s changed
You don’t put old pictures in a new frame
I’m proof mane
You fix the broken I’m soaking because You reign
And through pain I’m kickin’ it like Lou Kang
Joy comes in the morning
I used to be Sadd in the a.m. …Hussein
Now I got a smile that they can’t take away
You make a way
As long as you exist I’ve got a place to stay

[Chorus: Sevin]
You love me
I cursed you
You’re beautiful
I’m ugly and I don’t deserve you
You’ve got me singing ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
You are God
You are God
You got me singing ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah you are God

[Verse 3: Sevin]
Fourteen years in it mane and I’m still climbing
Still seeking and still finding
There’s a difference between worshipping Yeshua with music
And then rhyming
Kinda like the difference between the cubic and real diamond
Yeshua’s the king, he’s the way truth and the life
Some of ya’ll is just debut anti christ
Your pride is written in your sense of self entitlement
You looked in the mirror and been worshipping that idol since
Jesus I’m sick in treatment man I’m sick of sin
Trying to dig us out the stigma that they stick us in
Sometime’s my vision’s blurried like I licked the lens
And I’m tempted to get worried about my dividends
This world’s water be rising so I flip my fins
Too often compromising when I’m with my friends
If pride is not a substance we are swimming in
Then why in our discussion we’re reluctant to admit our sin?
Just because people follow you don’t make you a leader
Unless you point them to the Father you a true deceiver
All of this modeling after modern trends you gotta send a lot of sin
Mane and it is swallowing these new believers
Yeah your lyrics is the fingerprint You leave behind
I’ve learned to speak my heart instead of speak my mind
Some balance in your pivot’s what you need to find
Cuz homie your talents ain’t gone get it bruh you need to grind

[Chorus: Sevin and Sheena]
You love me
I cursed you
You’re beautiful
I’m ugly and I don’t deserve you
You’ve got me singing ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
You are God
You are God
You got me singing ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah you are God

You are my God
The race is not given to the swift or to the strong
But it’s given to Him that endures
Help me to endure

I guess this is what famous is

(Gotta move on, gotta be stronger than that)
Those bricks will never fall

[Verse 3]
You got me questioning
You got me questioning myself
And I will never stop changing
We gotta shake ourselves
We gotta start doing what's right
No more lies

When will you and I
Finally get to realize
Gotta get together
For forever

[Chorus]
When will you and I
Finally get to realize
Gotta get together
For forever

Can you make me feel alive?
Can you make me feel alive?
Can you make me feel alive?
Can you make me feel alive?
Gotta get together
For forever

When will you and I
Finally get to realize
Gotta get together
For forever

When will you and I
Finally get to realize
Gotta get together
For forever

Can you make me feel alive?
Can you make me feel alive?
(You are the only one that really makes me feel alive)
Can you make me feel alive?
Gotta get together
For forever
Can you make me feel alive?

Sometimes everything comes easy
Most times it's hard to even start
Sometimes our working move me deeply
Most times I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I live just in the moment
The next I worry for a month
Sometimes I'm dancing in the light of the sun
Most times I'm tapping in the dark

Maybe I don't know
Maybe that's okay
Maybe I'll just let the wind blow
And carry me away
Lately I believe it's
All out of my hands
Maybe in an afterlife
This will all make sense

Sometimes I stop and see life clearly
Most times it's passing in a blink
Some days I want the world to hear me
Most times can't find my voice within

Most times I'm scared of growing up
Deep down I know that we are over
But if I'm honest I'm just stuck

So give me recognition, Hip Hop now is an exhibition
In exorcism of niggas spitting less than the best is given
The next edition and twist the rappers are less efficient
Than Rivers that’s hitting visions, my verses are premonitions
Gimme minds, I eat rappers whole: gimme lines
Galactics of this rap shit, my tactics I intertwine
What’s in his minds is thinner time. Nigga you hear the time?
Been spittin’ divine, since the dawn of existence and time (Yes)
Witness the rhyme, Lamar you set the bar high
See it's [?] hard as the dark side
Dragon's are like the court-room figure we all rise
Fly as high the sky, the skies [?]
Acknowledge my potential, demolishing art and temples
Undermine the underdog and I swear to God I’ll be vengeful
They got more stars and stripes, but I got more heart and more mental
So if you ever count me out, I will do my part and will end you
Game of Thrones? More like the game of bones, my crown is my city
Maybe self-proclaimed for now, but I hold it down 'til they wit’ me
50-50 I’ll either be [?] king, but I swiftly pick up Excalibur
My calibre is torturin’ Achilles
And killin’ Arthur, the kind of slaughter you hide from ya daughters
The author of the highest order labelled me to destroy ya
I thought I told ya, a soldier with the weight of worlds on his shoulders
But breaking boulders with bare hands, while walkin’ on water
Something to talk about, so put me in conversations
The kind of greatness, you witness once in a constellation
My combination is dark and blatant, incarcerated with hatred
As compensation destroy you for confirmation
Gotta prove myself, I’m a loser in stealth
Tryna say I couldn't hang; I'm like a noose, two pelts
Around the neck, of a dude that tried to douse himself
‘Cause he took in all the pain that this mu-sic felt
Rappers are slackers, we’ll summon ‘til this reason attract us
Spitting disasters force him to acknowledge that factor
And so hip hop ain't dead it's just looking for masses
I'm in this shit to win and we can shake hands after

Hold me tonight
What happened to me?
My head in the clouds
Fallen so deep
You came in soft
No shoes on my feet
Cold and afraid
It feels like I could break down
Right here on this shore
I'll go astray

Where earth meets water
The wind blows smoke
Across the land
So hear me out
Our lives get harder
It slips through our fingers
Like a fistful of sand

Lay down tonight
The stars as our spine
Summer will fade
And it feels like I will lose you
With each of the turning tide
Till the first snow arrive

Where earth meets water
The wind blows smoke
Across the land
So hear me out
Our lives get harder
It slips through our fingers

You show me not to let, show me not to let, let it go

All over again, time after time
I never believed it could be mine
A flash in the dark, when nothing was right
When I'm with you I feel alive

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

We're splitting the sky with fire in our hearts
And nothing can stop us leaving the past
They try pulling us back and tying us down
We're too far gone
Way up above it all, up above it all were
Something beautiful and it's all because you
Show me not to let, show me not to let, let it go

All over again, time after time
I never believed it could be mine
A flash in the dark, when nothing was right
When I'm with you feel alive

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

Where do I start? The past and the chase
You hunted me down like a wolf, a predator
I felt like a deer in love lights

Hungry for that flesh of mine

What do you see in those yellow eyes?

615,25817,The Way,Shapov,"Are we to young to feel this way?
Or is it just something people say?
Is this impossible?
Or am i just wasting my time?
I didn't know I could feel like this,
is that a crime?
I'm so not used to this.
The feeling I miss,
to not have a care in the world.
And to not go through this process
Would things be different,
if we really knew,
What our outcomes were,
and how we grew.
Or would things be the same,
as we slowly grew insane.
So maybe they are right,
to say what they say.
About things we don't know,
about feeling this way.

We can’t let go
I’ve got a thousand good reasons to stay
If we chase the clouds away
We chase the clouds away
We chase the clouds away

Wake me up in silence dear
Together we’ll be lost in time
Gonna take you someplace safe
But faraway

You’ve got the perfect gift for me
That makes it all work
When the fire comes from deep within
Something lives inside us
We feel the love
Now we can let it burn

So don’t you hold me now
Just lose it all
Don’t you hold me down
We can’t let go
I’ve got a thousand good reasons to stay
If we chase the clouds away
We chase the clouds away
We chase the clouds away

627,25819,We'll Be Ok,Afrojack,"[Verse 1]
A hundred years ago someone said to me
You could change the world by the way you speak
But every word you hear is every word you say
I could see the feelings written on your face
You don't believe in love
You don't believe it's true
You don't know where I go
You don't know what I do
If I could make you see the way it's supposed to be
Only love could set you free

[Chorus]
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)

[Verse 2]
A hundred years from now
Maybe we'll turn around and
See the flowers growing in the battle grounds
Let's go to sleep tonight, wake up another day
When we can build a world that's made of different shades
I still believe in love
I still believe it's true
I'm takin' where I've been and see what I can do
I'm tryna make you see the way it ought to be
Only love could set you free

[Chorus]
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)

[Verse 3]
Hold my hand
You know we can learn to love again
And I'll never hurt you! I'll be your friend
Yeah, for better or worse
Just don't let go, goo-o-o!!

[Chorus]
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
Don't be afraid, you know
Music will play (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
Don't be afraid, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I had no idea
That everything soon would be crystal clear
After all these years
It's turning up, up, up
In this hotel room

[Chorus]
Changed my point of view
All I thought I knew
Now I got viewed
In this hotel room
Changed my point of view
All I thought I knew
Now I got viewed
In this hotel room
(Now I got viewed
In this hotel room, now I got viewed
In this hotel room, now I got viewed
In this hotel room, In this hotel room, In this hotel room)
Oh, just me and you in that hotel room
Oh, lost in love just me and you

This wide and open road
Out in the pouring rain
Now that I think of you
The sun shines through
Puts a smile on my face

Baby we don't need to run away
Forever we are gonna stay
I believe no matter what they say
We're miracles, we're miracles
We are miracles you and I
I know we can last forever
Like the ocean and the open sky
We're miracles, we're miracles

Miracles tonight

Baby I see the sunlight in your eyes
Now that the rain has gone
And when the stars collide
I'm by your side gonna be there

Baby we don't need to run away
Forever we are gonna stay
When you call me I'll be on my way
We're miracles, we're miracles you and I
We are miracles you and I
I know we can last forever

Turn the nights into a glory day
Pray
Stand up for the rules and pray
We can make it a better place
When we pray for freedom
It doesn't matter what kind of race
When we pray for freedom
So let's live for the promise land
Living in harmony
So let's live with a helping hand
Dreams of a new generation and we pray
What has happened to paradise
In motion or paralyzed
Isolation, immigration
Frustration all over the nation
We've been waisting most of our time
Talking about things and that's no sign
Recognize the advice
It's more than only an exercise
Remember of the world so far away
Where people stay and pray everyday
They have their hopes, they have their chance
To pray for peace and tolerance
Remember of past time paradise
A system without any compromise
Let me say we can find a way
Stand up for the rules and pray
We can make it a better place
When we pray for freedom
It doesn't matter what kind of race
When we pray for freedom
So let's live for the promise land
Living in harmony
So let's live with a helping hand
Dreams of a new generation and we pray
Pray
Pray
What has happened to paradise
Is it turned into a world of sorrow and lies
So many people don't care about rules
Honest people seem to be the fools
Time to wise up, time to rise up
Open your eyes up to the top
Hold a dream against the wind
Close your eyes and let it in
I've heard of a world so far away
Where people stay and pray everyday
They have no god, no sovereign
They pray for their rules and so they win
Remember of past time paradise
To be living in no compromise
Let me say we can find a way
Stand up for the rules and pray
We can make it a better place
When we pray for freedom
It doesn't matter what kind of race
When we pray for freedom
So let's live for the promise land
Living in harmony
So let's live with a helping hand
Dreams of a new generation and we pray
Pray
Pray
We can make it a better place
When we pray for freedom
It doesn't matter what kind of race
When we pray for freedom
So let's live for the promise land
Living in harmony
So let's live with a helping hand
Dreams of a new generation and we pray

Before I let y'all know ‘bout how my steel clap
Ultimate Warrior had to have the battle in Newark
Cause Smack would've got his shit peeled back
I ain't never been a trouble maker, but if Ars' left a nigga bleeding
You may wanna investigate Rex
Cause it's definitely a mason
If these ten knuckles can't stretch this nigga even I'm on the side of the highway with my gun out
Like I'm trying to catch a nigga speeding
I'm a bully, tell this lil' bitch nigga I take porridge
If I see it and I like it, I snatch it, I don't wait for it
I'm disposing this nigga for one, I hate garbage
And with my aim I should've played shooting guard for Wake Forest
But I chose to rap, I still gangbang and I load the Mac
My money long enough to let all my homies hold a stack
Do we have a problem?
Soon as you show that gat I introduce you to that rocket launcher with the shoulder strap
You ain't a shooter nor a rider, you a chauffeur poodle
You got a vivid imagination, I'm a show your brutal
This shit I'm dropping got me rich
You gon think I'm flushing Oprah doo doo
I spread cream all on your bitch, then treat her lips like a toaster strudel
This lil nigga named Randy, I'm banking on his family Halloween he *knock, knock* then I'm taking all his candy
Walk into your mom kitchen, tie the apron to your granny
Chop her up, hide her body in the basement by the pantry
Then I walk in your studio and slap the shit out of yo engineer
I fire on anybody else who ever try to think or interfere
I hak a lugie on your mic, that nigga Mook he kinda tight
I walk up to him in his face and ask him do he wanna fight?
You gon think I'm a sketch artist from the way I draw the uz' on him
One shot, instant kill, BANG! Call of Duty on him
Slice him while he fucking, soon as his bitch put her booty on em
Then iPhone Fox walkie talkie call the Goonies on 'em
I'm the villain so I terrorize the people
Kill this nigga first round so we can set aside the sequel
Jowie every lines deceitful, I'll stab him with Magic Johnson's tattoo gun
And purposely forget to sterilize the needle
I said I cock Blocks, pop pop, blood on your bed spread
You're not hot, so stop cock blocking you're dead Fred
Starving niggas like you in my city get fed led
Low cut niggas die in the land of the dread head
Now Ill told you the nigga that robbed you
Wanted to prove that you lame
And you was softer than a Titty Boi, so now he got 2 Chainz
I would've said, you see what happen to you trying to be a pretty boy?
Nigga snatched them triple 9's from you in yo city boy
And the Jesus Piece they tried to pawn it wasn't worth a penny boy
In the last year Rex was robbed for ""2 Chainz!"" without Titty Boi
You wanna knuckle up with me? I got that pocket knife
Once you enter your house, your front door you better lock it twice
Hundred round clip, awww shit when that choppa slice
Every Dot in your residence hit, I even shot the mice
You seem shocked that I'm killing you
Like you stuck aluminum foil in a socket twice
My hitman Haitian and he'll off you for a box of rice
He starving, killing niggas for food, pizza pasta price '
What you think he'll do if I told 'em that Randy got your slice? Bombs in your mailbox a package full of anthrax
When I fire that heat will wok your body like some candle wax
I slam, you slam, my gun jam, while I'm slamming back
I'll slap you with the pistol, you'll think the pistol had a hand attached
I'm dressed in all black like on that Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell
You'll think I fed the clip pasta cause out the barrel
I'ma send him shells I disrespect you on purpose, I give a fuck who you niggas tell
I piss in your favorite cup, put ice in it and tell you that it's ginger ale
And you better drink it and eat the ice when you finished
If not I’ma make sure you meet with ICE when you finished
For playing games with me, you gon lose your life in a scrimmage
You could be blue though cause I'm Popeye coming right off the spinach
You couldn't beat me if I played you on rookie mode
I'm the type of nigga snatch your breezy off foot patrol
Tell her my chocolate melt in her mouth not in her hand
And her hand my Tootsie Roll
Then stick my whole arm in her, I Vince Carter that pussy hole
And if you really a male nurse, then you got Gaylord Focker's job
And being a male nurse is worse than being a soccer mom
I know you don't wanna rumble in the jumble or the octagon
If we was two coke heads with a kilo to snort
You couldn't keep up with me line for line I spelt your name in all 100's, waited for you to sign the line
You battled 5,762 niggas after that, still I waited for you to find the time
Yes it was in your DNA to battle Tech around Ramadan
It was kinda Okwerd how Conceited did you and Ill beat you line for line
I ain't gon' stop till my account whole 8 digits
First round, he small thing to a giant and I motherfuckin' data midgets!

[Round 1: T-Rex]
Grown man bam is something he gotta deal with
It don't matter how many of them fabricated lines he just said
It ain't gon equal up to this real shit
This nigga moved from Newark to New Orleans
And got the Newark niggas protecting you
Thais 95% of the reason I ain't got respect for you
So it's best for you to chill with that ""I'ma slap T-Rex shit."" Cause it's hammers on deck and niggas done died for less shit
I'll have bullets in his stomach, back, legs, hips
And since he got dreads he's used to getting his head twist
My life is full of extended clips and head shots
Hustling on the corner, who gives a fuck if the Feds watch?
You really think we gon believe that you let the lead pop?
When you rap about clarinets and Hulkamania leg drops?
And ahead swing on me, that's what you said Ahk
And I'ma have a red dot on each and every dread lock
My niggas got lead cocked, they thirsty to spray a clip
Find one of his locks (LOX) on the ROC, Jadakiss
You see my patience is not that big
So a nigga to get off on, I'm not that kid
One funny move, I'ma pop your wig I got a little Trick Trick that'II make you forget what a Shotgun is
For one, my patience not that big
So a nigga to get off on, I'm not that kid
One funny move and I'ma pop your wig I got a little Trick Trick that'll make you forget what a Shotgun is
And that shows that he's a fake guy
Cause under no circumstances in the world I'ma say I don't know Mook or K-Shine
We all got love for Hip-Hop right? So y'all gon understand me
Well Calicoe took Arsonal out the back
Like Trick Trick was Chrissy and he was Yourndi
I'ma make y'all think right Calicoe killed him and saved him all in the same night
Took em to the airport, told to have a safe flight
Cause if Arsonal was at a wedding he wouldn't swing rice
Play nice before I shoot you in broad daylight
Have red lights all on the back of his car like the brake lights
They think cause they got me in Newark I'm out of the zone
Long as there's gangstas in the building I'm a feel I'm at home
I walk around with the clip and the chrome
I take my dog with me to Arsonal grave site to give 'em his bones
My niggas been warring, it ain't nothing new
The odds in this so scared he'll think Trick Trick you my uncle too
We could fight or take to guns, what you wanna do?
My team like the wheelchair league, we roll up and shoot
Your name don't ring bells in the Jersey section
You only hang with Shotgun Suge for protection
Ask Surf the night of Summer Madness, I fucked Bella that same night
And you be kissing that bitch in the mouth like that's your wife He just a stupid Crip that wanna be Blood
Violate me, I beat 'em until he see blood
Have the Locs looking like ""He knew he wasn't gonna beat cuz.""
I'm who he wanna be, cause, because, his girl a Rex groupie
He be on my dick more than she does
I give 'em 3 slugs, enough to fill 3 lungs, the doctor said ""Arsonal's Crip, now he needs Blood.""
You like talking bout Red? I do too dawg
I'll have him laying in a puddle of Red with his head blew/blue off
You think I don't know about gangs cause I ain't flagging?
My niggas said they stay 0-50 and don't fuck with them red dragons
Different magnums that don't come in no gold wrapping
Lay-a-way bullets you get the most on the back end
He wanted war, fuck it, I'ma gun him off
My options is the pen/pin or the gutter, I'm a bowling ball
He can't beat me, I talk greasy like motor oil
They suspenders, with these two straps I'm shooting overall
I kill lames, fronting? He gon feel pain
That 40 have me explaining my story in front of Mills Lane
I'm throwing bullets like a Buffalo Bills game
Them shells will have his train of thought derailed/Darell
Like his real name I'm going back to Harlem with this nigga dreads
Y'all know my slogan... THIS NIGGA DEAD!

[Round 2: Arsonal]
You lost to Conceited clearly, this I gotta let you know
But your fan base will never leave you
It's like New Yorkers got a special glow
They still give you hugs and kisses, a lot of X and 0
Overlook your asshole mistakes and accept you back
For example just look at Plaxico
Rex you garbage, that's a fact well established
And the only Macho Man named Randy was a Savage
See the crack that I distribute turn tilies into addicts
And your lines ain't connecting which means your channels turn to static
Rapping bout 12 12 skinny's ain't gon make you a D Boy nigga
It's four elements to hip-hop and you the B Boy nigga
I stab you in your other ear I bet it keloid quicker
Now bow down and kiss the chucks like you Leroy nigga!
And Sho Nuff, you came, you showed up
So I'm gon' literally smoke you, no papers, no Dutch
I'm gon walk up on your block with my pack and post up
They like ""This Rex corner"" I don't give a fuck and then what!?
I run shit here! You just live here!
Shoot em in his head while his mother and both his kids there
Take em to the hospital in my car, fill out his paper work and sit there
Texting everybody in his phone like ""It was crazy y'all should've been there.""
We pull triggers while you Call Of Duty button pressing
Your 3 minute round wasn't nothing but a bluffing session
I'll put a knife hole in your Pb just to neutralize your lung congestion
Quick blast one shot and yo bitch ass
You'll think I'm trying to give him a butt injection
My bullets fight to leave the barrel, hollow's bugging in my gun
So I'ma exercise my trigger til ain't nothing in my gun
You ain't nothing but a bum
This gotta be Don't Be A Menace In South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood, cause I'm younger than my son
Surf fucked your baby mother, got it on camera
You called her and she talk to you about
You bending over and her eating yo ass crack
You could have that, that ain't even what I'm mad at
You remember I told that faggot nigga Joe Budden
He the male version of Kat Stacks?
Well you remind me of that rat on a snap trap
With the cheese caught in yo backpack
You fag that handle balls in yo backfield, you a half back
Nigga cool out, Rex tell the truth what you know about pulling your tool out
Having a shootout right in front your principal soon as he let school out
Telling your crew bout a new route and watching your soldiers move out
You can't pretend to comprehend my friend an what are you bout?
You can catch me on these worthless streets, purple chucks, purple fleece
Hammer tucked in my waistline my dickies got a perfect crease
Rebel/Devil I make your nephew smoke your niece
To keep it all in the family have your aunt and uncle promote the beef
Puff, Puff, pass with the chrome, I leave that Block smoking
It's baby locs in this neighborhood an Watts rolling
One shot in your temple that s officially mind blowing
To confirm you deserve you gon die with your eyes open
That first round wasn't yours, them his lyrics, your rhymes stolen
Dick all in her booty at breakfast, I have your moms moaning
Apes and bananas in that coochie that mean I'm congo'ing
You planking in your casket face down with your spine showing
While you out rhyming about pistol playing and pitching coke
Your bitch probably in the trap house rocking a nigga boat
She spitting on the mic, a soprano don't never miss a note
She the illest, what you talkin' bout Willis? She got a Different Stroke
She in that squat position, right hand jerkin, left on the pussy lips
My wood on deck she just waiting to get that pussy hit
I'm grand slamming every hit back, not on no rookie shit
Surf introduced your baby mom to that gangbang on some Tookie shit
So if I catch you creeping on my strip or even speaking of my bitch
I swear to god both these hands will have you leaking from the lip
Your moms will walk in the living room and find your brain on your lap
Her exact words is ""I know my son would die from thinking with his dick.'
I told you stay the fuck out my business, you still snooping?
My pill just dropped, I'm retarded, I'm still grooving
You could have a Kevlar/Teflon flap jacket with the Block
I'm Dirk Nowitski no matter what defense you brought to Newark tonight
I'm still shooting I don't dance or throw dollars, my shooters is old shottas
357's, Mac 11's and them old choppas
Manhattan rappers be traveling round the world
Bullets will alley oop to the clip then bang in every Harlem Globetrotter
Now don't get me wrong In Harlem everybody and they mama wanna be a rapper
Ask Jim Jones girl Chrissy, she'll tell you in Harlem
Everybody and they mama wanna be a rapper
Round here I be Chevy driving steady mobbing with that clapper
.357 by em let em try me and I'll clap ya
I ain't never seen Redman or Treach get treated like a sucka
But I did see Cam' and Jim Jones both get ran out the Rucker
I ain't ever seen Redman or Treach get treated like a sucka
But I did see Cam and Jim Jones both get ran out the Rucker
I swear to and I put my right hand to the man up above ya
I put the Block down for a second and beat the man out your mother!
And I gon stop til my account hold 8 digits
You a small thing to a giant and I motherfuckin' hate midgets!

[Round 2: T-Rex]
Ars, I remember the day that I met you, you was on my dick
Lux let you do a few battles, than you got on some shit
I remember, we was at the Lionz Den, he showed me he was a fan
Hoyee respected my work and wouldn't let go of my hand Accept my name at the Tech 9 battle that showed you had respect for me
But couldn't stand that you wasn't the man when you stood next to me
Then you put yourself on a level that you ain't even on
Spelt my name out in some money that wasn't even yours
Now pause, I ain't trying to play you Am
But if Lux put you on that mean a Harlem nigga made you
Ars They been waiting for years to see this Arsonal against T-Rex, that's scene mean shit
It turn into prom night when them choppers start squeezing
On you gon be in a suit, you get hit with this limousine clip
Shit, I'm thirsty to let a trigger blast
Bullets hit his ass, his blood will be going Twista fast
I'm on that old shit with a new clip and a different mask
Think he came with receipt how I put him in a bag
Niggas block dying once you see them shots flying
Me and him will never be cool, I am not lying
Pussy, you gon swing on who?
Ars, try it To get everything I hear (hair) straight, I use hot-iron
Niggas could've left him dead in the D
Fuck I gotta spell it out?
You called the DEA in the D
One day I was doing a show and it was me, Web and Jim
We was performing our hit I look left, I look right, then I looked left again
It was a nigga in the crowd and he was pumping his fist
And it was Arsonal, dancing to some shit that sound like this
I said, ""They don't call him Arsonal cause he got an arsenal full of tools
Ayo Dan, they call him Arsonal cause he got an arsenal full of moves.""
He could break dance, he could boogie, he could groove
He can even do the James Brown shit with his shoes
Fuck him, I leave everybody in his family stretched
Start with brother, moms, aunt and his granny next
No respect, walk up on him and start to air the Tec
You send it there with Rex, your shadow gotta wear a vest
My Illinois land lord niggas say they hate him, he's goofy
On sight, when they see 'em they gon spray at his Kufi
Walk up on him, hit em in the face with the uzi
Shoot em over and over and over in the same spot
You'd a think they was taping a movie
Damn, y'all I'm thirsty to leave his camp chalked
The water right in front of his building I'm there/Deer parked
I can't stand Ars run up and let a can spark
His brain will fly, blood will stain the floor, landmark
It's Optimus Prime when I'm popping the nine
Two nickel plates, Arsonal dotted the drop of a dime
Switch that, Optimus Prime when I'm popping the nine
Two nickel plates, Arsonal dotted, I got the drop from his dime
Switch that, Optimus Prime when I'm popping the nine
Two nickel plates, Arsonal died from dropping a dime
He's supposed to be a gangbanger and banging is the thang you do
If you an much of a gangbanger, why you always got a Blood on stage with you?
Probably cause this nigga pussy and he let bangers shoot
So when some shit pop off he be the nigga that's saving you
For K-Shine I'll ride and pull fo's out
Keep blowing at a nigga candle until it blows out
He just had a battle in Detroit and got paid
Why the fuck it took Calicoe and Smack to bail Surf out?
Y'all probably ain't know Calicoe and Smack bailed Surf out
But since we in Newark and they from Newark
That's something Newark need to know about
He'll probably ride when it come to that
Ain't no probably, my niggas gon ride cause we come with that
The grind, I'm in love with that, the block, I got lust for that
Who wanna pump right now?
I'm giving up 40 for a 100 pack
He an soft, he ain't ever letting chrome off
I give Streetz the head nod, his head will get blown off
Kill Arsonal on the house, that means no cost
We start putting niggas to sleep, we let dose off
Get your nose out my business or get it blown off
You bout to take a known loss right here in your home court
Me and you man to man, try to zone off
That fif silent you won't hear it ring like the phone's off
I said I'm leaving with this nigga's dreads
It's only rounder two this nigga dead!

[Round 3: Arsonal]
We finally in the Bricks! South ward is y'all in here?
What the fuck you gon do now, now that I got all of my men here?
See all my battles been away which means nine of my moods been fair
You was fucked at the door soon as the security let you in here
Cause if you show out, they block exits til there's no out
Crowd beating yo ass is the only footage to go out If I hear you say some disrespectful Crip shit outta yo mouth
I'ma pop on you out the blue you like a tire with a blow out
Running your mouth talking that tough shit, this your last night
Retarded strength, beat a nigga slow with a fast right
You never in your life heard of Ars had a bad fight
Thinking you the shit my nigga you'll get your ass wiped
Straight off the face of the earth, I'ma spazz right?
I'm undeniable with that cannon that means I'm dash right
This nigga here, for $100 and a flight
He do all my shooting, he @ThisIsTwizz I guess I'm Smack White
Running your mouth talking that tough shit, this your last night
Retarded strength, beat a nigga slow fast right
You never in your life heard of Ars had a bad fight
Thinking you the shit my nigga you get your ass wiped
Straight off the face of the earth, I'ma spazz right?
I'm undeniable with that cannon that mean I'm dash right This nigga here, for $100 and a flight He do all my shooting, he @ThisIsTwizz I guess I'm Smack White
This nigga think he know Newark cause he yelled a couple blocks out
Claiming a wrong hood will definitely get you knocked out
It's real him and G Shine niggas in the building
So K-Shine you better watch out, you ain't official
Set up arrangements for your moms to pick your box out
My shooter crazy as hell, she pop niggas with they cock out
She had a baby at 12, bitch was an 8th grade dropout
No gloves to hide her print, she pull a sock out, then pull a Block out
The nose on it longer than the 2011 NBA lockout
Now how dare you come to Newark and actually think you'll get a win off
I'll fight you with both hands behind my back
All kicks and guarantee you won't get a hit off
Cause soon as we square up and you think you bout to get some shit off
This whole front row gon knock your motherfucking wig off
With the gloves I'm a south paw If you don't believe me we could find the proof
Twin Glocks bust at the same time I'm ambidextrous when it's time to shoot
I'll fuck your bitch in one position just for thinking I was kinda cute
From the back so much hardcore Doggystyle
You gon think that bitch was signed to Snoop
You 5'2"", you don't scare anybody
You a Talladega Night ass nigga now do the Ricky Bobby I
'll take you the church up the street where they viewed Whitney body
And let the Boyz N The Hood really introduce you to Ricky's shotty
I'm coast to coast, I'm internationally known
You aren't, you put 10 years into this battle rap craft, but who's touring?
If battle rap was the NBA, my nigga you would be Luke Walton
Gangsta's don't die, we get chubby and move to New Orleans
And I knew you was gon speak on that, and it's no holding back
I'm in that 176 ward, Holly Grove where the soldiers at
I move from one city to another where niggas known to scrap
You'll get Wako'd for skipping up the block by a Juvenile
Cause everybody in that 'Nola Clap'
I live in a city where public drinking and pistol carrying is legalized
So I don't pack my MAC in the back of my Ac
My strap in my hand I don't need to hide
I mean I could walk down the block with my shit out, I don't need to ride
My strap is like you to his shadow, it never leave my side
I could walk in your son school with it out
An in his classroom during nap time, wake him out of his sleep like, ""No your daddy's been flat lined
Your mothers been sucking dick since the Super Bowl at halftime
And I'm only taking custody of you cause it's motherfucking tax time.""
Now since everybody that battled you talk about Mook
L'ma switch it up, all that talk about K-Shine, nah, l'ma zip it up
Chayna Ashley, she don't need a fan base look that bitch big enough
I'll steal weed off Tay Roc and let all of these niggas hit the Dutch
Get it? Listen up, I just broke down the whole Dot Mobb
Rex you been in a vet and still ain't make it in my top 5
Them Crip niggas you claim you hang out with, them niggas not live
They false flagging that meant hey ain't seeing right
That make em cock eyed I'm Crip for real and all of them baby locs do shoot
But watch this if you Blood and you fuck with Da Rebel my nigga
Soo Woo! It seems to me you gon have a problem when it's time to go
You seem a lil uncomfortable like it's hard for you to find your flow
Let me ask y'all a question, I'm Grape Street Cripping and that's OK alright
So refer to me as an American Gangster cause I don't play fight
And with that .38 I'm Frank Lucas, if you don't pay right
I'll shoot tango in the middle of his head in broad daylight
And if I'm lying I'm dying, I ain't dead so here's the topic
We was in California, I battled Diz', he battled Okwerdz
This was all around the time when I said when I see 'em l'ma slap him
Now l'ma tell y'all all the real reason behind why nothin' happen
I'm in my hotel room I get a knock at my door
Who is it? I'm really not sure I look through the peep hole, it's Louie the 13th that lil Dot Mob whore
I said ""What up"", he hesitated, his response was kinda iffy
Your boy looked over my shoulder
And seen I had them Grape niggas with me
I ain't gon lie I was in Oakland I had 7-8 niggas with me
My money long everywhere I go, you know I take niggas with me
So he said ""I'm, Rex wanna holla at you""
I said if he wanna holla, where he at nigga, I'm listening
And why the fuck would Rex send you on this dummy mission?
So I go up to this nigga room, in my mind you know I'm mad as shit
He open the door like ""Am we the only two repping the east coast
Let's stick together on this battle shit."" I swear to
And on my mother I seen a happy punk jump out his soul
Like a faggot with a bag of dicks
I cock back to slap his lips and I thought to myself I was raised by a woman
And mama said a man should never slap a bitch
Moral of the story I would've felt less than a man if I put my palms to him
So I cock back, I put in her hand and told my mom do him
I said ""But he a coke head please before you squeeze give that line to 'em.""
But soon as he hit that base line my mom bang on fern like Lebron do 'em
Rex you could talk about my daddy, you could even talk about my mother
Fuck, cause I'm a disrespectful motherfucker
Which means I can really give a mother-fuck!
That s just a lack of creativity for your bars, it's a cover up
And mama Rebel in the building and she says she'll fuck yo mother up
We could call 'em both to the stage
We could have our moms put the gloves on
My moms gon beat shit down yo moms leg
Til she bleeding or it's blood drawn
And she ain't gon stop til that account hold 8 digits
Fuck this mic situation y'all know my slogan I motherfucking hate midgets!

[Round 3: T-Rex]
Yo when I had my son I lost a little bit of love for this battle rap shit
But when my son turned 2 or 3 and you saw my last 2 or 3
You know I'm back bitch
You see these hammers that I'm carrying, they not for show
I let your whole space ship, I let a rocket go
One by one they'll be falling like dominoes
Arsonal death will be in a rush, he gotta go I fuck with crazy cats, fronting?
Get your lady snatched
Kid too, you need more than ribs to get that baby back
Against Miles I told y'all I was a crazy cat
I'll murk you, leave town, you don't know what part of main he at
Fuck slow it down, speed it up, we been saying that
See my niggas don't play, word, watch your word play
I could get you KO'd, I give the OK I cock the old 'K, cock and aim it yo way
If this nigga acting bugged, that snub will be the Mac spray
You see I got a mean shot, but it's no game
Two tre's and I'm shooting from Larry Bird range
That story that he just told, he was fronting
He said he was gon slap me when he seen me and did nothing
It turnt to the post office when that clip dumping
I'll get a mail/male boxed if I send something
You war with Dots we off your blocks, no valentine
They find his heart in a chocolate box
No fuck the talking ock, I'll let them 40's pop
Clap him through the jacket, I'm like Dirk with them awkward shots
I got the belt and I'm defending mine
When we ride, if kids outside, they meant to die
Once them hollow tips get inside
This nigga meat will start falling off the bone like it's tenderized L
Et's take it this route, we could let the fits out
The person that's gon' die, is the person with the big mouth
Caught em and his broad while he was sleeping at his bitch house
When I blast off, I take half off, I'm trying to make this count I'm a vet, I'm not a rookie in the game
I'm schooling niggas, Ars been playing hookie
It's okay, but if he act up I'ma walk up and hit 'em with the thing
I be clapping the arm like I'm looking for a vein
I promise I'll finish his folks, squeeze the lead
Crack his egg, have him spilling his yolk til he dead
Grab the lead and shove the fifth down his throat
He got his whole orange peeled, he was beat to a pulp
A nigga like Ars could never ever fuck with me
Cause all this shit he say, it'll never equal up to me 4
My feelings am shot, you feeling a shock a you numb on your left side
That feeling's 'you shot', nigga laugh when they squeal to the cops
Crazy Arsonal rolling at his funeral, his wheel's on his box
I been built to flip yours, in 10 days I be chopping bricks like a Sensai
Comprehends? Look I told y'all I was coming for this nigga head
I don't even wanna finish my round cause this nigga dead

704,25907,Good On Me,Vanic,"[Verse 1]
People are talking like I could do better without you
But they got no love and they don't know us
And they can’t look away so let's give 'em a show with a nice view
’Cause we know that touch make 'em all jealous
Everybody craves a little danger
And you take me where I've been too scared to go, oh
You open up what's hidden in my nature
And every time we're done I want it more, yeah

[Chorus]
I can't stay away, I've been bad and you're to blame
They say I should pray, but you look so good on me
I’m as good as gone ever since I tried you on
I can’t stay away 'cause you look so good on me
’Cause you look so good on me
'Cause you look so good

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been losing sleep 'cause I’m thinking about you
How you take your time blurring all these lines
And the way you're controlling my body ain't nothing I'm used to
No, you're not my type, but you fit just right

[Chorus]
I can't stay away, I've been bad and you're to blame
They say I should pray, but you look so good on me
I'm as good as gone ever since I tried you on
I can't stay away 'cause you look so good on me

Too far gone, too far gone

[Verse 1: Olivia Holt]
When we were apart
All I'd ever do is think about you
Syncopated hearts
Lightyears away but I still feel your every move
Like you're in my arms, so when you're not
And now that you are, it's like you're not

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Holt]
Well, I've been holding on too long
Too far gone, too hard to reach us
Turning right, turning wrong
Could've been a hundred reasons
I don't know how we got lost
I don't know how we get back
We're too far gone, don't wanna feel this

Distance between us
Distance between us
Too far gone, too far
The distance between us
Distance between us
Too far gone, too far gone

Baby, timing is a fine line between lovers and strangers
'Cause I'm lying here at night right next to you and I hate this
It ain't right, but it's like I'm out of sync
Out of everything we used to dream of
Now it's like we'll never be enough, oh

As she closes the door
She's taking what she wants, baby, you can have it all

You feel it?
Now, now
Put your money down, put your drinks up, Rec League is in the building
On a mission from the top hill y'all still tryna get in touch with your inner children
Where the weed at? Where the bar is? We got some things to do
I tell the crowd, ""get as loud as you can"", they eating out of my hand like finger food
How you love that, where the love at? I'm about to blaze an acre
Give me one night, all I need is one mic, got them on the run like Bay to Breakers
Put your drinks down, put your money up, everybody just pass the green
And they all wanna see Grip spit the flame, so fuck water, I just sip gasoline

[Bridge: Richie Cunning, Grip Grand]
The flow too hot, cool it now like New Edition
You can't fuck with the Rec, dawg, you stupid, listen
You need to save your breath, be more fuel efficient
While we keep shit moving like the sewer system
They try to make the music stop, but did we quit?
No. We tryna take it to the top like a ski lift
I got a visual flow, I make 'em sea sick
Lines that I spit are so ill, I make me sick

[Verse 2: Richie Cunning, Grip Grand]
Never slow down, never slow up, never gave in, never gave out
Grip never give less than the best so the rest, know there's no contest like a rain-out
And there's no prospect of a pay-out, men are so complex like a schizo
And we all love a simple flow, but your shit got us all bored stiff like a crypto
So Frisco, so west coast, you can check my driver's license
Rich Cunning reside in California, spitting on the corner like a fire hydrant
I'm feeling good, he feeling good, everybody okay
And we gon' stay feeling good till the day we call it quits, and everybody gon' say
""I need you bad like the air I breathe, bad like some therapy
Bad like Eric B. and Rakim with just Eric B.""
Step to me, I guarantee it end unsuccessfully
I show you how to make it, I'm the motherfucking recipe
Yeah, sprinkle some Rec on it, and let the pot simmer
We be some meat pork chops, y'all just chop liver
My team the last of our kind, we some polar bears
Fuck a single, we remix your whole career
I don't remix the song (what), I just remove your vocals
Then we fix the song (yo) with some smoother vocals
Yeah, you need me bad. Glass half empty like there's bread
Glass half full like my reefer bag
Break out the legal pad, I'm developing schemes
Big things on my mind, I got elephant dreams
What can I say, the Rec is a hell of a team
Yo DJ, bring back the red, yellow and green

I can’t be the answer nor the truth
I’ll murder your love
Embrace your fate and shut your shrill
Today’s new victim will tomorrow kill
And murder new love

738,25953,Lily,Alan Walker,"(feat. K-391 & Emelie Hollow)

[Verse 1:Delvo]
Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then she tried to run
And then on the night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone

[Pre-Chorus: Delvo]
They warned her, don’t go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping
It told her, don’t you worry just

[Chorus: Delvo]
Follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you watch and go
That'll be the magic story you’ve been told
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

[Verse 2: Delvo]
She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again
Then she ran faster and
Started screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me
Come get me
Behind her, she can hear it say

[Chorus: Delvo]
Follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you watch and go
That'll be the magic story you’ve been told
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

[Bridge: Delvo]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Everything you wanted gotta be the magic story you’ve been told
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh

[Outro: Delvo]
Follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Then she ran faster and

It won't be the same

So call me names
Threw us away
Yet I'm the one that you will blame

Yet I'm the one that you will blame

Yet I'm the one that you will blame

I still feel your shadows in the dark
Ripping through my heart
Broken bones, we're left with battle scars
Torn apart

[Couplet 1]
NSY, Nouvelle Source d’Ypérite dans la mesa depuis mes débuts
J’ai perdu tellement des miens pour en arriver là, qu’à l’heure où j'te parle mon cœur n’y est plus
J’ai eu mal quand j’ai compris qu’à cause des anciennes rancœurs, pour moi plus rien ne serait nouveau
Lumière noire m’a permis autour de moi, de dissocier le vrai du faux
J’ai tè-je compassion à la poubelle, ensuite j’ai rеvendu la mort pour que ma vie soit plus bеlle
De plus en plus saoul car chaque jour, j’ai de moins en moins de gens avec qui partager ma bouteille
Quand j’avais des ennuis, très souvent personne n’était là donc j’ai du tout assumer solo
Mouvement historique, maintenant qu’ils voient c'que je suis, la plupart se remettent à nous follow
C’est triste a dire mais quand ces gens pensaient pouvoir tout me prendre, mon cœur était d'jà vide
Dangereux à mort mais comme j’étais dans le jeu à mort, j’ai joué avec ma vie
Mia, si vengeance m’appelle pour qu’on puisse se revoir, il faudrait que je t’invite
Comme elle savait déjà que je brillerais comme une étoile, ma mère m’a appelé David

[Refrain]
J'n’ai rien vu, j'n’ai rien dit, j'n’ai rien entendu, du lundi au lundi, la dope j’ai revendu
J'n’ai rien dit, j'n’ai rien vu, j'n’ai rien entendu, du lundi au lundi, la dope j’ai revendu
J'n’ai rien vu, j'n’ai rien dit, j'n’ai rien entendu, du lundi au lundi, la dope j’ai revendu
J'n’ai rien dit, j'n’ai rien vu, j'n’ai rien entendu, du lundi au lundi, la dope j’ai revendu

[Post-refrain]
Jamais
J’ai vu la chance me faire du vice donc pour m’en sortir sans ailes dans les ruelles, j’ai du voler
L’amour nous rend aveugle, pour retrouver la vue, il m'faudrait des billets ultraviolets

[Couplet 2]
J’ai visé le sommet sans prendre d’échelle, attendant qu'le karma vienne m’enlever mes chaines
Fuck les histoires d’amour, au lit j'me déchaîne car quand j’étais pas en chien, j'tombais sur des chiennes
Garde la tête haute et on s'dit que ça ira, vu que dans tous les cas on est forcé d’assumer
Bloqué en bas avec Philippe Morris et Marie-Jeanne, j’ai vu mes rêves partir en fumée
J’ai vu des potes, très rapidement devenir des putes, oubliant c'qu’on s’est dit à l’époque
J’ai vu mes potes, casser des carreaux pour les thunes en espérant qu'ça nous ouvre des portes
J’ai vu un porc demander à un d'mes amis blancs si j'faisais vraiment partie d'ses potes
Elengi Ya Trafic de près ou de loin, tous les soirs, j'trouve un plan pour dépasser les bornes
J’ai vu la chance me faire du vice donc pour m’en sortir, sans ailes bébé j’ai dû voler
Vu que l’amour nous rend aveugle, pour retrouver la vue, il me faut des billets ultraviolets, bref
Chaque jour le temps passe mais je n'regrette pas d’avoir fait des fautes
Très peu sont en place car le trois quarts voudrait celles des autres

I tried to climb into your skin
I tried to locate the beating
Of your, your, your, your heart
Of your, your, your, your heart
I walked for hours inside you
I talked in my voice and tried to
Find your, your, your, your heart
Find your, your, your, your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I ran through all your veins
I saw all of your visions
I found all of you, babe
But I couldn't find me anywhere
And now I'm stuck inside of you

[Chorus]
Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get free, oh, baby
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you
Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get free, oh, baby
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you

[Verse 2]
You keep my heart between your teeth
Incisors cutting into me
Oh you're, you're, you're, you're sharp
On my, my, my, my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I ran through all your veins
I saw all of your visions
I found all of you, babe
But I couldn't find me anywhere
And now I'm stuck inside of you

[Chorus]
Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get free, oh, baby
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you
Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get out, oh, baby
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you

[Bridge]
I feel your mouth when you kiss her lips
I trace her skin with your fingertips
I see her the way you do and it hurts
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get free, oh, baby (Baby)
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you
Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get out, oh, baby
I'm too invested (I'm too invested), I can't get obsessed with you

41,26133,Sad Song,Alesso,"[Verse 1]
I'll go to the moon just to get close to you
But sitting in your room, I feel so far, far, far away
You know what to do to pull me into you
’Cause every time you move, you take my breath, breath, breath away

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I hear you, oh
Suddenly off my feet
So will you come through? Oh
And I'll play you on repeat, ooh

[Chorus]
You're singing a sad song, but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You’re singing a sad song, but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart and I'm falling apart just like I knew I would

[Verse 2]
Tell me why I save every last dance for you
And everything you say, I memori-i-ize it all
You know how to get me higher even when I wanna cry
But you're setting me on fire just to warm, warm, warm you up

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I hear you, oh
Suddenly off my feet
So will you come through? Oh
And I'll play you on repeat, ooh

[Chorus]
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart and I’m falling apart just like I knew I would

[Post-Chorus]
Everything about you kinda makes it sound happy
How many words for you to hurt me so, hurt me so good
Everything about you kinda makes it sound happy
I’m falling apart just, falling apart just like I knew you would

Hear you deep inside of me
Your back and forth is slowly killing me
Don't just leave me quietly
Play your song and keep convincing me

You’re singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart and I'm falling apart just like I knew I would

43,26120,Burn The World,Dominix,"Force of shackles binding with torment
Through their points in a laughing sky

For each birth an affliction so cruel

The grasping hands of fate

Ties that limit, blinding illusions
Lying image of false affections
From the cradle and beyond the grave
The jealous eyes of ""god""

And for each star that guides your way
A hidden ruler, to keep untouched the tyrant's reign
So burn the world

Silent voices inducing oppression
Weakening thought forms through mind intrusion
Bereft of true will man must die
For all eternity

And for each star that guides his way
A hidden ruler, at war with all that serves our cause
So burn the world

A new day dawns, another mountain wall to climb
Burn the world! Burn the world!
A new day dawns, another mountain wall to find

Burn the world now with flames of rebellion
Rise to power through lawless dominion
In ashes the remains of man
Shall signal our revenge

And like each star that fell to bless the hidden bloodline
So forged the swords for the elect
Now burn the world

For all of the pain and the worry
I take the world on my back
Just to change your heart, change your mind
I know that I took you for granted
God knows I used all my chances
I do whatever it takes
Just to change your heart, change your mind
Remember when we were younger
Kissing on every corner
Don't let this be our very last time
Tell me it ain't over
Let me pull you closer
Hold you like I used to hold ya
Don't let this be our last goodbye
Tell me it ain't over

Tell me it ain't over

Tell me it ain't over
Tell me it ain't over
Tell me it ain't over
Tell me it ain't over

Don't let it be dead in the water
Cause I opened nothing before ya
And I will take anything back
Just to change your heart, change your mind
Remember when we were younger
Kissing on every corner
Don't let this be our very last time
Tell me it ain't over
Let me pull you closer

And not a second left to waste

And there are stories left untold
And when it feels like coming home it's you and I
And all dreams we have are coming faster
Circles that we follow
And it feels like coming home it's you and I

67,26152,Old School,Justin Prime,"I'm spittin' hot fire, like a dragon on the mic
Old school rap style, yea im bringin' the hype
But I stay relevant, up to date in the game
Flippin' the script, and putting mumble rap to shame
From the East to the West, I'm a lyrical beast
My flow so smooth, call me the wordsmith priest
Got the rhythm and the vibes, never gonna quit or cease
Flippin' scripts, bringin' heat like a furnace release
I'm a pioneer, breakin' barriers in the game
Paving the way with my rhymes, no need for fame
Spittin' fire on the mic, fuelin' up the flame
Elevatin' the art, you know I run this lane
Got that skill and style, like a hip-hop magician
Flippin' words like tricks, it's a verbal expedition
From boom bap beats to trap's addiction
I stay versatile, always in top condition

It's a new era, but I keep it old school
Blending classic vibes with the modern-day cool
Hittin' hard with words, im breakin' every rule
This rap's a time machine, takin' you back to old school
Back in the day, we had a different vibe
But I'ma mix it up, keep it fresh, won't subside
My flow's infectious, like a viral outbreak
Bringing that old school flavor, theres no mistake

I'm the voice of the streets, representin' the real
Highlightin' the struggles, lettin' all the pain heal
Using these words as my weapon, bringin' truth to reveal
Old school rap resurrected, that's the deal
I'm a wordsmith, crafting lines with precision
Makin' heads nod, causin' these lyrical collisions
My vocabulary's vast, no need for mumble rap
Every word I drop, it'll make you stumble back
Hip-hop's evolution, it can't be denied
But I'm bringin' it back, with a nostalgic pride
Old school beats, with a modern twist
Rappin' the truth, making the haters miss
We reminisce about the legends before
Biggie and Pac, the ones we adore
But now we got new legends on the rise
Kendrick, Cole, they reachin' the skies
Setting the bar so high, they mesmerize

It's a new era, but I keep it old school
Blending classic vibes with the modern-day cool
Hittin' hard with words, im breakin' every rule
This rap's a time machine, takin' you back to old school
Back in the day, we had a different vibe
But I'ma mix it up, keep it fresh, won't subside
My flow's infectious, like a viral outbreak
Bringing that old school flavor, theres no mistake

Droppin' beats like bombs, boom and explode
Rockin' the stage, got the crowd in the mode
New school cats, you better take note
I'm the rap pioneer, leavin' 'em stoked
I'm bridging the gap, generations unite
Passin' the torch, keepin' the flame burnin' bright
Respect to the legends who paved the way
Old school rap with a modern sway
I'm a storyteller, narratin' the streets
From the block to the city, my rhymes compete
Talkin' 'bout life, the struggles we meet
Old school style with a brand-new beat
I'm the mic controller, the rhythm conductor
Old school rap, still a crowd seducer
From the past to the present, I'm a true inducer
The essence of hip-hop, can't find a reducer
So let the beat drop, let the rhymes flow
Old school rap with a modern glow
Respect to the legends who paved the road
I'm here to carry on, watch my story unfold
No autotune, just raw talent in my flow
Representin' the old school, but still lettin' it grow
Old school flow with a modern twist
Taking it back while im keeping it legit
I'm flipping through the pages of rap history
Paying homage to the pioneers, that's my duty
But I'm adding new flavors, breaking the mold
Fusing old school wisdom with stories untold
This rap game has evolved, but the essence remains
It's about the message, the rhythm in our veins
So let's unite, old school and new
Creating a movement that's so fresh and true

It's a new era, but I keep it old school
Blending classic vibes with the modern-day cool
Hittin' hard with words, im breakin' every rule
This rap's a time machine, takin' you back to old school
Back in the day, we had a different vibe
But I'ma mix it up, keep it fresh, won't subside
My flow's infectious, like a viral outbreak
Bringing that old school flavor, theres no mistake

70,26199,Rising Like The Sun,Qulinez,"[Verse]
Caught up in such a head rush, wide-eyed lately
Colors blurring around us, fast and fading
We're in the city of street lights, nightlife strangers
We know everything is ours for the taking
So let's take it, take it now

[Chorus]
Before daylight starts to come
Breathing night into our lungs
We are reckless, we are young
We are rising like the sun

Make it last till oblivion
Never gonna sleep again
We are reckless, we are young
We are rising like the sun, rising like the sun
And if you fall, we just wake up
'Cause we are rising like the sun

[Post-Chorus]
We are rising like the sun
Make it last till oblivion
Never gonna sleep again
We are reckless, we are young
We are rising like the sun

[Verse 2]
We're lost in our own world just how we like it
City lights burning bright and so cinematic
The crowd is moving around us, walls are shaking
We know everything is ours for the taking
So let's take it, take it now

[Chorus]
Before daylight starts to come
Breathing night into our lungs
We are reckless, we are young
We are rising like the sun

Make it last till oblivion
Never gonna sleep again
We are reckless, we are young
We are rising like the sun, rising like the sun
And if you fall, we just wake up
'Cause we are rising like the sun

[Post-Chorus]
We are rising like the sun
Make it last till oblivion
Never gonna sleep again
We are reckless, we are young
We are rising like the sun

71,26193,Never Fade,Alex Guesta,"Forget what's far away
Tomorrow is today
Nothing else is real

We hunger for
The truth behind the glass
The beauty unsurpassed
The spark to start the heat

A rush of blood
Our pounding heart
We close our eyes
Release our guard
And no one life
Will be the same

We're rising up
In unison
We'll never touch
Defeat again
This brilliant light
Will never fade
Never fade

Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time

Is harder to fight

But don't you see you're holding
All the keys to all the dungeons
Let yourself out
Just let you be found

I had to look up when I saw you
And almost being struck by lightning
Staring at the light of the stars
It's like looking in the mirror
Just before the dawn, it's the darkest
So if this what you are then you're honest
Everything is in on the outside
Clap as the sun goes down
Clap as the sun goes down

When the world stops spinnin' round
And gravity brings you down, don't give in
When the weight's too much to bear
And nobody seems to care, don't give in
Throw your hands to heaven

Look at what we've started
Everything comes from something
Love from pain, hope from hate and life from the rain

I'm not waiting, I'm drowning
And the elements won't give in, don't give in
Throw your hands to heaven

In pockets deeper than you know

Sneaking out of these embrace
Paper thin, whispering, breaking in

You filled me up to the top
You filled me with your love
It feels so good, it feels so good
Like I'm never coming down
And ever since that day
The ground beneath me fades away
It fades away
It fades away

[Chorus]
And watch me go, watch me go
Float away, like helium, your love
Fill me up to the top
Never stop, like helium, like helium, your love

[Verse 2]
Up here I'm exposed
I've never felt this close
To atmosphere, the atmosphere
Has really got me
And ever since that day
The ground beneath me fades away
It fades away
It fades away

[Chorus]
And watch me go, watch me go
Float away, like helium, like helium, your love

[Bridge]
Things I say
Always seem to come into play
But ever since I met you that day
The ground beneath, it fades away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away

[Chorus]
And watch me go, watch me go
Float away, like helium, like helium, your love
And watch me go, watch me go
Float away, like helium, like helium, your love

118,26205,No One Knows Who We Are,Kaskade,"[Verse 1]
We are shouting
We are whispering
We give it all
We have nothing

Built our houses on our hands
We are confident in our own plans
Here we sleep and here we stand
We are right now

[Chorus] (x2)
Oh woah oh
No one knows who we are
Oh woah oh
No one gave us a mark

Oh woah oh
No one knows who we are
Oh woah oh
No one gave us a mark

[Verse 2]
We have held back
We have pushed on
We can control
We can look on

We're not searching for a name
Or looking back the way we came
We're not lost we're not ashamed
We are right now

[Chorus]
Oh woah oh
No one knows who we are
Oh woah oh
No one gave us a mark

Please. I’m all for looking hard at things that need to change, but first the fiction has to be knocked out of the discussion. Let me set a few things straight.

First off, this article is irrelevant and outdated. Perhaps if these journalists had written this twenty years ago, when the truth was a little more ragged, they could have made an argument that wasn’t so laughable. Back when warehouses were being broken into, fire codes were ignored, dodgy generators were powering a massive sound system and restrooms were non-existant. This was a time that safety probably wasn’t exactly job one. Things were smaller then, though. There weren’t tens of thousands of people looking to gather in one place, not like now. This scene has grown, and in response to the people it serves, it has grown up.

Today, massive events are being held on terms that have been scrutinized by engineers, civil servants, fire chiefs, policemen, and all manner of bureaucratic safety hoops. As EDM’s numbers have become larger, we’ve become more accountable. No longer hiding in an abandoned warehouse, we’re paying taxes, paying dues, and stimulating the hell out of each cities’ economy that hosts an event. Before the doors ever open, there is a string of green lights that have to be run through by people whose business it is to keep these events safe. The same codes put into place for every other genre of music applies to EDM. To say otherwise is untruthful and adheres to dangerous stereotyping.

I wouldn’t dare say we ignore the tragic accidents that happen. I wouldn’t dare say they don’t happen. But it takes a rudimentary understanding of the Basic Laws of Probability to guess that the more people that show up to these festivals, the larger the risk is that something goes awry. This isn’t unique to this music. This is a universal principle. Can we hope to avoid it? Absolutely. Can we take every precaution and security measure to hedge the odds? Definitely. But can the promoter be held responsible for the actions of the individuals at his events? No he can not.

What it comes down to is this: The responsibility to address substance abuse and addiction cannot come down to people who are event promoters. Not only is it unrealistic to expect them to tackle such a huge problem, it’s an enormous insult to those who have made it their life’s work to do so. Clearly, if the US Government hasn’t come up with the magic bullet to quell the problem of drugs in this country, it is not reasonable to expect an event promoter to pull this kind of trick out of his hat either.

I am dug in so deep that articles like this one, smacking of uninformed bigotry fire me up in a pretty passionate way. To assign responsibility of regulating drug use to concert promoters is ludicrous, in the extreme. To paint a picture (bordering on hysteria) of a community of people as capricious and reckless drug users is irresponsible.

This is a conversation that has been going on for decades. I don’t expect it to end here. But know this: as far as a music culture goes, EDM is the one who will accept the kids on the outliers, the ones who get bullied, the ones who feel like they may not quite fit in. This community is exceptional in its ability to bond all types together, and I am not exaggerating when I say it saves lives. Our audience is intelligent and kind, discriminating only in regards to which sound they like best. Our audience is unprecedented in their drive to proactively support each other.

There’s your story, LA Times. Do the world a favor and dig into that for a change, punks.

119,26203,Wonder,Adventure Club,"[Verse 1 - The Kite String Tangle]
Have you ever wondered
What it could be like
And I was all set to come back home
You were after nothing I could give long
Have you ever wondered
What it could be like
And I was standing back on my feet
There's nothing there
So now you want better

And I know I should have held you closer
And I know I should have treated you better
In a perfect world
But we're not always
What we promised to be
You caught my words in mid-air
The silence hung as you caught my eye
Conversations locked away in my mind

[Chorus - The Kite String Tangle]
And I know I should have held you closer
And I know I should have treated you better
And I know I should have treated you better
And I know I should have treated you better
And I know I should have treated you better

[Verse 2 - The Kite String Tangle]

There's nothing there

And I know I should have held you closer
And I know I should have treated you better
In a perfect world
But we're not always what we promised to be
You caught my words in mid-air
The silence hung as you caught my eye
Conversations locked away in my mind

And I know I should have held you closer
And I know I should have treated you better
And I know I should have treated you better
And I know I should have treated you better

Quiet nights feel like a murmur
But we all wanna feel the heartbeat
Silence seeming cold like winter
'Til we get our souls we can't breathe

[Buildup]
We are waiting for the lights and the thunder
We are waiting as our dreams turn to color
Every second wanting more
It's a calm before the storm
We are waiting for the lights and the thunder

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
This is the only truth we want
Watching the sky for a hint of a spark
Sailing further towards the unknown
Melting down our hearts of stone
Lift our happy hands from the cold
The wind whispers you are never ever alone
(Never ever alone)

[Buildup]
We are waiting for the lights and the thunder
We are waiting as our dreams turn to color
Every second wanting more
It's a calm before the storm
We are waiting for the lights and the thunder

123,26218,Leaving You,Audien,"Verse
Oh, lookie here I am burning again
Thought it was real but your love it was only pretend
Oh, lookie here I am walking away
I turn around if you beg, if you beg me to stay

This time I don’t think so
I had enough of your romance reflow
Heart breaker with an ego
You were doing some things that could've been illegal
Make sense out of nothing at all
You were pretty much evil
But I've got more to say

Chorus
No I never, never met nobody, body like you
That ain’t no compliment, that’s the truth
You’re nothing but a cold heart covered in gold
That’s why, that’s why, that's why, that's why I’m leaving you
